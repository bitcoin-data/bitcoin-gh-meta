This depends on the state of the vcpkg packages which can't be replicated on a fork.\r\n\r\nmsvc warning C4834 for the Bitcoin Core build was introduced by Visual Studio 16.4.0. This PR adds an ignore rule for the warning (it's related to the nodiscard attribute and is not considered relevant).\r\n\r\nAn additional side effect of the msvc compiler update is the cached Qt5.9.8 libraries cannot be linked due to being built with an earlier version of the compiler. To fix this Qt5.12.6 has been built with the updated msvc compiler and added to the appveyor job.\r\n",
