It's a real pain to juggle the Appveyor job to get the vcpkg's installed, force a failure to update the cache, then re-run the job to do that actual build. GitHub Actions don't have the 1hr limit... Admittedly Github Actions do have a 100% failure rate on the python functional tests but if we want them to be reliable on either Windows based CI they need work any way.",
