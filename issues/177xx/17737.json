Until we allow chainstate creation from UTXO snapshots (next assumeutxo PR?) it's basically unnecessary, but it is a prerequisite for background IBD support.\r\n\r\nChanges are also made to the initialization process to make use of `g_chainman` and thus clear the way for multiple chainstates being loaded on startup.\r\n\r\nOne immediate benefit of this change is that we no longer have the `g_blockman` global, but instead have the ChainstateManager inject a reference of its shared BlockManager into any chainstate it creates.\r\n\r\nAnother immediate benefit is that uses of `ChainActive()` and `ChainstateActive()` are now covered by lock annotations. Because use of `g_chainman` is annotated to require cs_main, these two functions subsequently follow.\r\n\r\nBecause of whitespace changes, this diff looks bigger than it is. E.g., 4813167d98 is most easily reviewed with\r\n```sh\r\ngit show --color-moved=dimmed_zebra -w 4813167d98\r\n```",
