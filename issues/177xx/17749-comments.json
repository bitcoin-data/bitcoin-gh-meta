The reason the dependency was added was to solve an [intermittent clipboard bug](https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/233795).\r\n\r\nIMHO I don't think this would warrant a patch of Qt given the Bitcoin Core GUI can also use the Windows clipboard and thus be affected by the bug.\r\n\r\nWill close this issue and wait until the > Qt5.12 update is proposed for Bitcoin Core before any further action.",
