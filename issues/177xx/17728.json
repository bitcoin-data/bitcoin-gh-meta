   "body" : "It was reported on [IRC](http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2019-12-11.html#l-377) that `scantxoutset`'s API was broken in 0.19.0:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<belcher> i think scantxoutset may have been broken in bitcoin core 0.19 ? regardless of what parameters i run it with (e.g. \"scantxoutset abort\", \"scantxoutset status\") it just returns the help doc, according to the release notes the only change was https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16285/files but i dont see anything that wouldve broken it, it works fine in 0.18\r\n<belcher> im on regtest, in case its important\r\n<harding> I can confirm `scantxoutset abort` returns the help doc on latest master.  Waiting for 0.18.1 to start now to attempt to reproduce there.\r\n<harding> It looks like it's expecting a second parameter (even though that doesn't make sense with \"abort\").\r\n<jonatack> Same for me as well\r\n<harding> Can also confirm that `scantxoutset abort` returns the expected result on 0.18.1.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs noted in the conversation, previously, the second argument of `scanobjects` is only required for the `start` action. `Stop` and `abort` actions did not and could work without them.\r\n\r\nIt appears that this was broken by #16240 which enforced the size of the arguments to match the listed required arguments.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, this PR makes the `scanobjects` argument an optional argument. Then only in the `start` action do we check whether the `scanobjects` argument is there and throw an informative error about that. Also a test is added for this case.",
