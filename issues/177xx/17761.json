   "body" : "Hi all,\r\n\r\nIt is known that Bitcoin miners could be a problem in the near future (what if a miner can mine more than 50% of transactions? what about electricity waste caused by mining?...).\r\n\r\nTo avoid that, why do not remove all transaction fees and in exchange, the bitcoin sender must perform some mining every time they make a bitcoin transaction? this way, the sender will act as a miner for a few transactions of others. The system will be self-regulated: the more transactions are in the system, the more miners there will be available.\r\n\r\nNowadays, there are javascript libraries doing that for miners, so when you enter in a website you are mining for others, many times illegally because they do not warn you. Why do not include that in the core of Bitcoin? That way:\r\n\r\n- Fees would be removed and any transaction would be completely free\r\n- Electricity waste caused by mining would be dramatically reduced\r\n- The system would be self-regulated regarding to mining tasks\r\n- Senders would know they have to perform some mining\r\n- Mining tasks would be re-distributed instead of centralized as it is happening now (miners are concentrated where electricity and technology are cheaper)\r\n\r\nHope this help and thank you very much for your great effort!\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\nNote: apologize if this is not the right place to share my thoughts :)",
