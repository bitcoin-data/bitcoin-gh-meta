   "body" : "**This is based on #16545 + #17580.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`d0abe645d76` Fix nonsensical -norpcwhitelist, -norpcallowip and related behavior](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17783/commits/d0abe645d7648e44c0d5cd9a43482448a65c1532)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis change fixes some corner cases handling negated list options: `-norpcwhitelist`, `-norpcallowip`, `-norpcbind`, `-nobind`, `-nowhitebind`, `-noconnect`, `-noexternalip`, and `-noonlynet`. Negating these options is now the same as not specifying them at all. This is useful for being able to override config file options on the command line without seeing parameter interaction side effects from the otherwise ignored config options.\r\n\r\nThe code change here is just avoid calling the `IsArgSet()` function on `ALLOW_LIST` options, and to disallow such calls in the future. Code that uses `IsArgSet()` with list options is confusing and leads to mistakes due to the easy to overlook case where an argument is negated and `IsArgSet()` returns true, but `GetArgs()` returns an empty list.\r\n\r\nThis change includes release notes, but the release notes don't go into details about specific options. For reference this change:\r\n\r\n- Treats specifying -norpcwhitelist exactly the same as not specifying any -rpcwhitelist, instead of behaving exactly almost the same but flipping the default -rpcwhitelistdefault value.\r\n\r\n- Treats specifying -norpcallowip and -norpcbind exactly the same as not specifying -rpcallowip or -rpcbind, instead of failing to bind to localhost and failing to show warnings when one value is set without the other.\r\n\r\n- Treats specifying -nobind, -nowhitebind, and -noconnect exactly the same as not specifying -bind, -whitebind, or -connect values instead of treating them almost the same but causing parameter interactions with -dnsseed, -listen, and m_use_addrman_outgoing values.\r\n\r\n- Treats specifying -noexternalip exactly the same as not specifying any -externalip, instead of treating it almost the same but interacting with the -discover value.\r\n\r\n- Treats specifying -noonlynet exactly the same as not specifying -onlynet instead of marking all networks unreachable.\r\n\r\n- Clarifies -vbparams and -debug handling code and fixes misleading comments without changing behavior.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've wanted to clean up these cases for a while but motivation doing it it now came from recently merged #12763 introducing a new case.",
