   "body" : "This is a followup to @sjors' PR #17509 . My goal is to propose a very simple initial dialog for the \"Load PSBT...\" menu item, to go one step beyond just \"broadcast or nothing\" as the functionality.\r\n\r\nSee attached -- the idea is to display a summary of what we know about the transaction and the workflow, and then offer relevant options based on that.\r\n\r\nThoughts? I want to keep this absolutely as simple as possible this time around (since last time my biggest mistake was trying to do too much at once, I think.)\r\n\r\n![IMG_20191210_142555](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/458997/70574744-ab684c80-1b59-11ea-8ebb-8285f23aedbc.jpg)\r\n",
