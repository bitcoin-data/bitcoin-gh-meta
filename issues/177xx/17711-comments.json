I think hardcoding (or at least, having your own constants for these in your applications) these things makes a lot of sense because they're not going to change without a reason you probably need to be aware of!\r\n\r\n(Say, in the unlikely case that there would be a new kind of base58 address format, you wouldn't want your application to silently start accepting them without at least having looked over it. Doing so might lead to funds loss.)",

But I guess you are right it's just a couple of consts that never change. I kinda envisioned that more on the Elements case to be honest, where you could end up with multiple chains and you needed to avoid hardcoding everything all over again.",
