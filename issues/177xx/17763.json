   "body" : "The newly added valgrind ci run is also run on travis. However, due to the slowdown of valgrind, some tests time out. Fixing this issue might take some time, but it should be rather easy. First, remove this line:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/890eac8f8286496bbae664792cd2a1e56991c669/ci/test/00_setup_env_native_valgrind.sh#L12\r\n\r\nThen, see which tests time out and bump their timeouts. Repeat.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\r\n\r\nUseful skills:\r\n\r\nBasic skills (Bash, Python, docker, virtual machines, valgrind)\r\n\r\nWant to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this. You are encouraged to comment on the issue if you are planning to work on it. This will help other contributors monitor which issues are actively being addressed and is also an effective way to request assistance if and when you need it.\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",
