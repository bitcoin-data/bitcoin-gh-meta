   "body" : "If after a backup, an address is issued beyond the initial\r\nkeypool range and none of the addresses in this range\r\nis seen onchain, if a wallet is restored from backup, even in\r\ncase of rescan, funds may be loss due to the look-ahead\r\nbuffer not being incremented and so restored wallet not detecting\r\nonchain out-of-range address as derived from its seed.\r\n\r\nThis scenario is theoretically unavoidable due to the requirement\r\nof the keypool to have a max size. However, given the default\r\nkeypool size, this is unlikely. Document better keypool size\r\nimplications to avoid user setting a too low value.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile reviewing #17681, it took me a while to figure out the safety implications of keypool, I find it would be better to document this a bit farther to avoid users shooting themselves in the foot.
