      "body" : "So, this causes nodes to impose an upper bound on their peers response latency. Effectively, someone who will take a minute to respond can't participate in the network at all. This may adversely impact some anonymity protocols which cause high latencyÃ¢ÂÂ for many kinds of Bitcoin usage the latency isn't all that critical. I'd suggest that such users should be using an alternative transport, except the bitcoin p2p protocol is already reasonably well designed for high latency usage (at least its highly asynchronous).\r\n\r\nSome of the other side effects of timeouts is that they can reduce link stability during a DOS attack, and they can preclude some kinds of node high availability schemes which might cause tens of seconds of unresponsiveness (e.g. during a state resync or hardware migration).  Connection slot filling attacks are more effective if you can overload a peer temporarily and make them drop all their good connections.\r\n\r\nSome other protocols, like BGP, negotiate the heart-beatingÃ¢ÂÂ 30, 90 being a common set of parameters in that caseÃ¢ÂÂ to address the problem of potentially imposing too fast a response requirement.  But since our network protocol is _mostly_ stateless (thoughÃ¢ÂÂ it has become less so with bloom-filtering, and never was completely: e.g. inv caching) there is less of an issue as restarts aren't so bad.\r\n\r\nI'd instead prefer a longer timeout and _separately_ having peer rotation code that periodically slays the least recently active node from node out of the set which been heard from in >60 seconds. E.g. imposing the shorter timeout but only when we could potentially better use the slot.\r\n\r\nTCP's design targets a maximum segment lifetime of 2 minutes. Many operating systems have an SO_KEEPALIVE timeout of around 10 minutes. Somewhere in that range \r\n",

A node thats holding up our connection but not responding for >5 minutes is _really_ broken as far as we should care. It can reconnect when it can start responding again.  (and yes, in some cases bitocoind is 'broken', but thats okay... reconnecting is fairly cheap).\r\n\r\nThe flip side of a long timeout is that we'll leave connections up to busted peersÃ¢ÂÂ keeping ourselves offline (or our resources consumed) for up to the timeoutÃ¢ÂÂ when we could otherwise have useful connections up.\r\n\r\nMaybe it would make sense to have a conservative upper limit for now, I certantly wouldn't want to delay pulling this further to debate the timeout.  I'm happy with anything 5 minutes or longer but would prefer closer to 5 minutes.  Future peer rotation could prioritize punting long idle connection, which would address the problem that you might sit partitioned from the network for many minutes with no working connections.\r\n",
