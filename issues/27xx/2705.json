   "body" : "When my system crashes, the peers.dat file often ends up zero-sized. When this happens, vector vchData.resize(dataSize) is handed a negative dataSize. It takes it as an unsigned int and attempts to resize it to 18 hexillion bytes, crashing with a std::bad_alloc, which is presented as \"bitcoin in Runaway exception\"\n\nThis pull simply adds a 'if ( dataSize < 0 ) dataSize = 0;' check before running resize(). Another option would be to make the resize() call itself conditional on dataSize being positive.\n",
