   "body" : "Refactor keytime:\n- Key metadata is kept in a CWallet::mapKeyMetadata (std::map< CKeyID, CKeyMetadata>).\n- When generating a new key, time is put in that map, and new key is written.\n- AddKeyPubKey and AddCryptedKey do not take a creation time argument, but instead\n  pull it from that map, if it exists there.\n\nBugfix:\n- AddKeyPubKey and AddCryptedKey in CWallet didn't override the CKeyStore\n  definition anymore. This is fixed, as they no longed need the nCreationTime\n  argument now.\n\nAlso a few related other changes:\n- Metadata can be overwritten.\n- Only GenerateNewKey calls GetTime(), as it's the only place where we know for\n  sure a key was not constructed earlier.\n- When the nTimeFirstKey is known to be inaccurate, it is set to the value 1\n  (instead of 0, which would mean unknown).\n- Use CPubKey instead of std::vector< unsigned char> where possible.\n\nFixes #2779 and #2780 \n",
