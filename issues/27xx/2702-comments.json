There's no downside to it. You can either fork the one from ripple, or create your own empty repository and push to it like this:\n\n```\n    # From your local bitcoin repository\n\n    # add a remote for bitcoin's fork of leveldb\n    git add leveldb git@github.com:bitcoin/leveldb.git \n\n    # add a remote for ripple's fork\n    git add ripple git@github.com:ripple/leveldb.git\n\n    # bring the ripple fork's ref into the local repo, so subtree-split can find it\n    git fetch ripple\n\n    # split out the commits to leveldb into its own branch\n    git subtree split -P src/leveldb -b leveldb\n\n    # push the recreated branch to bitcoin's repository.\n    # it will be called bitcoin-fork\n    git push leveldb leveldb:bitcoin-fork\n```\n\n@sipa You should try these steps anyway. You can always throw away the branch or repository. Get some practice with git-subtree, it's great!\n",

This is using git-subtree, so a copy of the LevelDB source is still inside our code, but there's a separate repository where development of our LevelDB tree can happen (it has significant changes, including a non-upstream Windows port with some patches by us). This way, the LevelDB code can live somewhat independently, but we can easily synchronize the in-repo copy.\n\nOne of the nice things about git-subtree is that it doesn't matter where that extra repository is maintained - it's only identified using commit ids. In a previous patch, we 'switched' to a tree that @vinniefalco extracted from our LevelDB history, and this commits pulls in changes that have been made there. My question is whether we wouldn't rather have such a LevelDB tree under github.com/bitcoin.\n",

Even if thats true, that kind of corruption hasn't happened for at least my node.\n\nI do think we should just setup a bitcoin/leveldb and subtree that though. It looks like reparenting it is kind of obnoxious (creates a big diff), so when we do need to apply some leveldb patch it would better be a tree we control.  Am I missing something here?\n",

Then you apply the level db patches to that branch. Finally, use \"git subtree pull\" or \"git subtree merge\" (preferably with --ff-only) on your local orphaned leveldb branch to bring the changes back in.\n\nOnce you have split your leveldb branch using \"git subtree split\" you can push it to your own remote leveldb repository and maintain it as a fork. Or not. Whatever you want to do. The files will still always exist as normal files in the bitcoin repo.\n\nAs usual contact me if you have questions.\n",
