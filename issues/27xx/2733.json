   "body" : "Extremely large wallets take a very long time to load.\n\nAfter some testing I found that most of the time was spent in EC_KEY_check_key\n\nThe fix this I have merged two of the checks into using a single CECKey instance, replaced EC_KEY_check_key with a faster operation (thanks to sipa for helping me there), and appended a hash of the private key to \"key\" entries.\n\nOn my system loading one private key took approximately 1500 usec.\n\nCKey::Load reduced this to 900 usec\nreplacing EC_KEY_check_key reduced this to 500 usec\nchecking just the hash reduced this to 40 usec\n",
