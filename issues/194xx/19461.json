This allows the GUI to be started and stopped independently of the node. By default with this change, `bitcoin-gui` will check if a `<datadir>/sockets/node.sock` socket exists and try to connect to that. If that doesn't work, it will spawn a new node process and start up the same way it did before this PR.\r\n\r\nThe default `bitcoin-gui` connect option is `-ipcconnect=auto`, which tries to connect if possible as described above, and spawns a new `bitcoin-node` process if not possible. Other supported options are `-noipcconnect` to never connect to an existing node and always spawn a new one, `-ipcconnect` to require a connection and fail if it can't be established, and `-ipcconnect=unix:<socket>` to require a connection and use a custom socket path.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, basic functionality works and gui instances can connect and disconnect from a running node. But there are rough edges: If a gui process doesn't shut down cleanly, the node can see unhandled IpcExceptions, and if node command line options are passed to `bitcoin-gui` and `bitcoin-gui` connects to an exiting bitcoin-node process instead of spawning a new one, the node options will be silently ignored. \r\n\r\nThese changes require multiprocess support and this PR has no effect unless bitcoin is configured with `--enable-multiprocess` as described in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)",
