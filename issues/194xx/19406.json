   "body" : "New macOS releases have historically led to unpleasant surprises. I'm running the beta on an older machine, so I'll post testing progress here. Most problems deserver their own issue. See #16387 for Catalina beta testing last year.\r\n\r\nI consider [Universal Apps](https://developer.apple.com/programs/universal/) out of scope for this issue.\r\n\r\nI removed Homebrew and PyEnv first, installed Xcode 12 beta, before reinstalling them. This best represents what the actual OS will look like with a clean install. It also prevents Homebrew from installing Xcode 11 developer tools.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Beta 1\r\n\r\nBuild: 20A4299v on Intel CPU, using Xcode 12 beta (without Universal App support).\r\n\r\nDownloading 0.20 binary from bitcoincore.org works fine (with right-click install).\r\n\r\nTested master @ 19612ca2eb2e335c8ccc9c0f33421df22f1cc3b6\r\n\r\nI didn't test ZMQ and libmultiprocess yet.\r\n\r\n### Without depends\r\n\r\nFirst I installed dependencies using homebrew 2.4.2. I use `--build-from-source` to see if there's any homebrew packages that probably need a Big Sure specific update . That revealed with a few problems.\r\n\r\nInstalling Python via PyEnv doesn't work yet (see https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/1643), but you can install the binary for now, or via homebrew.\r\n\r\nBrew can't install `berkeley-db4` using `--build-from-source`, but it can use the Catalina bottle.\r\n\r\nclang crashed for `test/test_bitcoin-scheduler_tests`; I sent a bug report to Apple, attached logs for @practicalswift and other compiler aficionados. I wasn't reproducible, not even after `git clean -dfx`.\r\n[crash.zip](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/4844713/crash.zip)\r\n\r\n### With depends\r\n\r\nI was unable to build QT the first time, but can't reproduce that problem. BDB may need a patch (#19411). During blockchain download catchup, I got a `LevelDB read failure: Corruption: block checksum mismatch` error. I'll see if I can reproduce that. See #19410.\r\n",
