   "body" : "Hi all!\r\n\r\nAs part of the [anchor outputs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/688) work for Lightning (in the context of [eclair](https://github.com/acinq/eclair)), I'm wondering if it's possible to use psbts and the `bumpfee` RPC or if I'll have to implement a lot of fee bumping code myself outside of `bitcoind`.\r\n\r\nA quick summary of the situation (a lot more details [here](https://github.com/t-bast/lightning-docs/blob/master/lightning-txs.md) if you're interested):\r\n\r\n* we have a \"commit tx\" that represents the state of the channel\r\n* this \"commit tx\" has an output for CPFP carve-out (called \"anchor\") that we use to bump the fee (through a \"claim anchor tx\")\r\n\r\n```ascii\r\n  commit tx\r\n+--------------+\r\n|   vout       |\r\n| +----------+ |\r\n| | output 1 | |\r\n| +----------+ |\r\n|     ...      |\r\n| +----------+ |\r\n| | anchor   | |-------+\r\n| +----------+ |       |         claim anchor tx\r\n|     ...      |       |       +-----------------------------------+\r\n| +----------+ |       |       |   vin               vout          |\r\n| | output n | |       |       | +-------------+   +-------------+ |\r\n| +----------+ |       +------>| | anchor utxo |   | wallet utxo | |\r\n+--------------+               | +-------------+   +-------------+ |\r\n                               | +-------------+                   |\r\n  unrelated tx         +------>| | wallet utxo |                   |\r\n+--------------+       |       | +-------------+                   |\r\n|   vout       |       |       +-----------------------------------+\r\n| +----------+ |       |\r\n| | output 1 | |-------+\r\n| +----------+ |\r\n|     ...      |\r\n| +----------+ |\r\n| | output m | |\r\n| +----------+ |\r\n+--------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `bitcoind` wallet doesn't have the keys necessary to spend the \"anchor\"; these are handled by the lightning node.\r\nBut I'd like to let `bitcoind` chose what inputs and outputs to add to that transaction to achieve a given feerate.\r\n\r\nThis looks like a perfect use-case for PSBT:\r\n\r\n* use `bitcoind`'s `walletcreatefundedpsbt` to obtain a wallet psbt\r\n* create a lightning psbt with only the anchor utxo as input\r\n* use `joinpsbts` to gather all inputs/outputs\r\n* use `walletprocesspsbt` to get signatures for the wallet inputs\r\n* add the signature for the anchor input and finalize the psbt\r\n\r\nOnce that's done, I can publish my \"claim anchor tx\".\r\nHowever if it still doesn't confirm in time, I'd like to RBF that transaction.\r\nBut obviously `bumpfee` will not work out of the box because there's one input that it can't automatically re-sign.\r\nWhat would be really great would be if `bumpfee` could replace all wallet inputs/outputs to bump the fee (abiding by all the BIP 125 rules) and then return a psbt with all the wallet inputs signed; I would then only need to re-sign the anchor input, finalize the psbt and broadcast it.\r\n\r\nIIUC 0.20.0 has taken a first step in that direction (returning a psbt in `bumpfee`), but it looks like it will only do that with a watch-only wallet, whereas I'd like that behavior with normal wallet too. Does this request make sense, and if so is this being currently worked on?",
