   "body" : "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This is based on #19160 + #10102.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`96c4cd092ed` multiprocess: Add -ipcconnect and -ipcbind options](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19460/commits/96c4cd092ed354858dfc457fafaec766b85c6e0d)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBuilding on #10102, this adds an `-ipcconnect` option to `bitcoin-wallet` and an `-ipcbind` option to `bitcoin-node` (both enabled by default in multiprocess builds) so bitcoin node will listen on a `<datadir>/sockets/node.sock` unix socket, and `bitcoin-wallet` will connect to it.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that `bitcoin-wallet` can be extended in the future to have some online functionality. For example, there could be a `bitcoin-wallet sync` command that will update balances and sync latest transactions to an unloaded wallet, or a `bitcoin-wallet serve` subcommand that loads a wallet and serves RPC requests, or a `bitcoin-wallet shell` subcommand that allows running RPC methods interactively like the GUI console, or just general support for `bitcoin-wallet <rpc method> <rpc params>` invocations suggested https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13926#issuecomment-455187379.\r\n\r\nThis PR is small and doesn't do much. The only visible change is that `bitcoin-wallet` now checks whether a node socket exists on startup and prints \"Connected to IPC address\" if it can connect it it.\r\n\r\nThe default `bitcoin-wallet` connect option is `-ipcconnect=auto`, which connects if possible as described above, and proceeds offline if not possible. Other supported options are `-noipcconnect` to disable ipc, `-ipcconnect` to require a connection and fail if it can't be established, and `-ipcconnect=unix:<socket>` to require a connection and use a custom socket path.\r\n\r\nThese changes require multiprocess support and this PR has no effect unless bitcoin is configured with `--enable-multiprocess` as described in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)\r\n",
