   "body" : "When loading descriptor caches, we would accidentally reinitialize the descriptor cache when seeing that one already exists. This should have only been initializing the cache when one does not exist. However this code itself is unnecessary as the act of looking up the cache to add to it will initialize it if it didn't already exist.\r\n\r\nThis issue could be hit by trying to load a wallet that had imported a multisig descriptor. The wallet would fail to load.\r\n\r\nA test has been added to wallet_importdescriptors.py to catch this case. Another test case has also been added to check that loading a wallet with only single key descriptors works.",
