   "body" : "Fixes bitcoin-core/gui#12\r\n\r\nCopied description from #19321: \r\n\r\nCurrently it is not possible to use travis in forked repositories due to the 50 minute limit on builds. A fresh build (uncached) of the thread sanitizer config takes more than 50 minutes.\r\n\r\nOne approach to fix this could be to throw away tests until the run time is less than 50 minutes. However, the risk of being blind of failures in the thrown away tests is not worth the gain. Also, to detect them, one has to run the tsan configuration nightly and failures could only be detected post-merge.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to ask travis support to raise the limit for a forked repository. This is a tedious and manual one-by-one process, so I'd rather not.\r\n\r\nFinally, a different ci provider can be used, since the config files are designed to be platform-agnostic. This is what I picked.\r\n\r\nI kept all settings identical to the travis machine for now. Both providers run in the google cloud, so this should be a \"move-only\".",
