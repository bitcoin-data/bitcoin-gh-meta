However, it can still be run by bypassing the security layer of Apple.\r\n\r\nIt is signed but not notarized for privacy reasons (background infos #18187).\r\nRight click and \"open...\" should allow you to start the app without issues.\r\nMost (all?) contributors where in favour of that solution versus sacrificing privacy.\r\n\r\n> 2 - When I launch it the first time it asks me to select a directory. This directory also will host the 300gigs for the block, so I created a BTC volume on the NAS (don't have that space available on the Mac mini) so I can save the ledger in its own dedicated space and it's here that I experience issues\r\n\r\n**NAS are not supported.**. Bitcoin Core should be run with a fast and direct disk access.",

It just has problems with AFP/NFS/SMB/CIFS and similar network filesystems. If you create an iSCSI volume on your NAS (https://www.qnap.com/en/how-to/tutorial/article/how-to-create-and-use-the-iscsi-target-service-on-a-qnap-nas/), and format and mount it with a regular filesystem on your mac mini, I don't think you should have any problems.",
