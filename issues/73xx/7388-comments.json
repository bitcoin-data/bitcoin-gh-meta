I do however think this due to a misunderstanding:\n- It's perfectly possible to keep accepting 0-conf transactions, if you believe they are safe for your use case. Opt-in RBF sets a non-maximum nSequence value, which causes many providers to already consider the transaction non-standard for the purpose of accepting 0-conf.\n- As a customer, you can choose to set opt-in RBF, and thus lose the ability to get your payment accepted before confirmation, but with the ability to easily change the fee afterwards or combine the transaction with others.\n- As a miner, the rational behaviour is to take the transaction with the highest fee (even for non opt-in cases).

That would be possible.\n\nBut most (all) wallets do already treat unconfirmed transactions/balance as **unconfirmed**. People should really not rely on **unconfirmed** balance. It's **unconfirmed**. ~~As recently shown by Peter Todd, it's quite easy to double spend your transaction, and this was without RBF being deployed.~~ If they rely on 0-conf they should use a merchant tools which includes risk analysis. \n\nIf you are selling services or goods after you have received a 0-conf transaction, you should be very careful with handing out the good/service while the transaction is **not confirmed** and you should certainly not use a standard wallet (you would take a very high risk). \n",

Similarly, because v0.12.0 changes what's allowed in OP_RETURN, you'll be able to easily doublespend by sending txs that use this new OP_RETURN format, followed by a tx that doesn't.\n\nAs for dedicated zeroconf providers like blockcypher, I don't know of any who haven't added opt-in RBF detection.\n",

At the ery minimum the wallet GUI should expose whether the transaction (or one of its ancestors) was opted in - this functionality shouldn't be limited just to RPC IMHO.\n",

That's inevitable. Worse, it can't be\nprevented, as anyone can change their software to modify policy.\n\nI'm sure you don't want to never change policy rules, though. We used to\nhave a minimum 0.01 BTC rule, for example. Should that never have been\nremoved?\n\nPolicy changes are sometimes necessary, so the temporary differences in\nwhat nodes relay too. You can however personally make the judgement that a\n0-conf transaction is acceptable to you. Perhaps because you trust the\nsender. Perhaps because you can undo what you do in return if it fails to\nconfirm. And perhaps because you're doing analysis of the transaction to\nestimate the chances, or let someone do it for you. And if you do the\nlatter, you should take the nSequence value into account, because it\n_already_ and _since Bitcoin 0.1_ is used in determining whether the\ntransaction was final.\n",

Your logic says that we should just not release 0.12 since it changes from what the network is currently running. By your logic, we should not do anything to change individual node policy or network consensus because it would \"change existing behaviour from the code base that runs the network\". BTW, 0.11.2 doesn't even hold the majority of nodes, only 42%, and it also had a policy change and soft fork.\n\n@amacneil It would disable RBF entirely be default and only allow it to be enabled through an option.\n",

Since 99% of node operators do not change the default settings, this has been a safe-enough (not 100% safe obviously) assumption.\n\nThis change radically changes that assumption as retailers must now use wallets with advanced new RBF features.  They must also come up with new workflows to deal with clientele who accidentally flag transactions as RBF.  Most retailers wont bother with this hassle (at best) and potentially ignorant retailers will lose a lot of money (at worst). This policy change (and by policy i am referring to the default settings since 99% of node operators will not change the defaults) is the equivalent of a nuclear bomb on the retailer community.  \n",

This is something that you should know all about and show us before you implement such dramatic changes to policy.\n\nSipa is saying that there are no services which accept 0-conf transactions that accept non-final transactions. Since opt-in makes it non-final, they are already prepared for that. He (and everyone else on the team) has already looked at the services and have already determined that they all already deal with non-final transactions. He is saying that you would not be able to find any service that doesn't already deal with those non-final 0-conf transactions because they all do.\n\n> I think it is really bad the way you guys are trying to force bitcoin into lightningcoin. Stealing fees from the miners will kill the long term viability of the Bitcoin network.\n\nHow is it stealing fees from miners? If anything, it increases fees for them.\n\n> You can see what the community thinks of RBF here:\n\nHow accurate is that survey? Does it accurately survey and represent the entire population? Do those who were part of that survey actually know what Opt-In RBF even means?\n\n@skajake Any service who already accepts 0-conf transactions will already check for certain things to be sure that the incoming transaction will be confirmed. One of them is the nSequence, and if it is not MAX_INT, then the transaction is non-final. Even if they do not upgrade, this code is already there because an nSequence that is not MAX_INT is already considered non-final and thus dangerous to accept 0-conf on. Thus that is irrelevant.\n\nAlso, if they only accept transactions with confirmations (as many do), then this doesn't matter to the retailer.\n",

The last thing we should be doing is making it harder it scarier for businesses to interact with or accept Bitcoin transactions. Of course someone with @petertodds level of skill can double spend, but businesses accept risk of counteroffer money being used for purchases but governments aren't making a huge issue about it so they self regulate those risks. If the news cycle were to suddenly start talking about the potential risks for accepting cash if would cause China's and confusion. Just as RBF is doing. \n\nThis is bad for Bitcoin and having this turned on as a default is bad for Bitcoin. \n\nDid devs talk to merchants about this.

Or are you referring to dev consensus as consensus?  \n\nIf you are that's fine, but I feel like consensus is a word often used by devs about devs. I think this is a problem as consensus is tossed around a lot in here. For instance devs re: RBF talk about having had consensus months ago. Should we not strive for a much more robust definition of consensus to be used going forward? Maybe that way we can avoid a separation in dev consensus and user consensus that Jeff is referring to that can be seen in the consider.it polling.\n",

As far as I know, no wallets have this possibility at this point at all, let alone do it by default. \n\nHowever, transactions that do opt-in to RBF are distinguishable (that's the whole point of opt-in versus full RBF), so a merchant that normally accept zero-conf can take that into account and only accept the transaction when it has confirmed. There's no extra risk when doing so.\n\nIt just increases flexibility to have this available. There are lots of complaints about stuck transactions that never confirm. WIth opt-in RBF it is possible to raise the fee on existing transactions (that opted in), so that transactions that initially had too little fee make it into the block chain.\n\nBy arguing to disable this you are killing a useful feature.

Has there been any (I really hope the answer is yes) surveying of experts in the bitcoin retail sector on how they feel about RBF and especially about it being defaulted as \"on.\"  All I am hearing outside of devs on here is that it is not wanted. The only people saying it is useful are devs or non-retail related individuals. If I am wrong great. But I am simply looking at the evidence available.\n\nIf you are bound and determined to make this change, isn't it reasonable to give people the option to \"opt in\" (all the way around, not just on one side) instead of opting out of something they simply may not understand or want?\n",

However business analyst exist in this world because they act as bridges between user/consumer/client desires and demands and engineers/technicians/coders.  Otherwise \"innovation\" is done in a vacuum. We are, in my opinion, seriously lacking in the equivalent of business analysts in the bitcoin community. Right now we seem to be operating by the sole principal that \"devs know best.\" In the real world this is simply not true. Does it not concern you at all that there is so much \"potential\" push back on this subject?  \n\nOr are devs just the smartest people in the room and the rest of us have not the intelligence to count as opinions?\n",

But if you think the latter is a case for, then why do you think it is that no one is double spending? (outside of @petertodd)? And can you possible see how people feel that there is a solution looking for a problem? In other words, \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"?\n",

Even if not, it is pretty much a trivial change, sometimes a one liner.\n\nPeople that do zero conf professionally seem to already take into account this (as they should!)\n",

If you can point out the best place (or a much better place) then I will do my best to spread the word to the community. \n\nBut the truth is decisions that effect the community are being ACKed and NACKed right here on github. And up to recently a large majority of the bitcoin eco system didn't even know it was happening. \n",

Maybe bitcoin users, despite being universally portrayed as criminals in the media, aren't that bad and just want this to work. Do I know?\n\nIn any case allowing opt-in RBF won't change this.

I sincerely hope you are trolling\n\nYou've been fed a false history. Full RBF was the original proposal, which was too controversial to be widely adapted. Opt-in RBF was proposed as a compromise to make both RBF supporters and the status quo happy. If the compromise fails, both groups go back to their extremes. People that want to use RBF will do so, by the means available (the full RBF patch). In contrast to this compromise, that doesn't need to be widely adapted (or \"forced down the throats of users\", who's trolling?) to be useful. But it is much more \"dangerous\" as it contains no flagging of transactions that can be replaced.\n",

The context here is that irreversibility is a feature. Double spending is the problem and the block chain is that solution. \n\nWhat is the block chain confirming? The first payment of the spender. Hence, it solving the double spend problem. \n\nSatoshi was clear on the first-seen-safe policy as a risk reducer. The context of a violation of that rule is that the minor confirming a double spent transaction either did not see the first one OR the minor is dishonest. Those are the only two options. Discovery of dishonesty is a deterrent. In an ideal mining context there are thousands of nodes creating blocks and their operators run honest code. In today's mining context with so few nodes creating blocks we can identify the dishonest nodes who are accepting a bribe to assist in theft. Bitcoin is designed to prevent double spends anyone participating in undermining that is a dishonest actor (by definition). \n",
