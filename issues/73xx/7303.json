   "body" : "Hi,\n\nI recently installed BitCoinCore 0.11.2 on my Windows 7 64bit Pro machine.\n\nThe first time I ran the program, all was fine, and the blockchain started to sync. I left this for several hours, but needed to turn my PC off so I shut the program down which was successful.\n\nWhen I rebooted and ran the program again, I received an error saying...\n\n\"Cannot obtain a lock on data directory (location here) Bitcoin Core is probably already running\"\n\nI have fixed this issue myself and can inform you that this problem arose because the HDD that I am using for BitCoinCore is not C, but a different internal HDD. This HDD was used on a previous PC installation - I then had to reinstall my PC and I am reusing this same HDD. Because this HDD was used on a previous installation, there are permissions problems. I simply went to the folder that BitCoinCore is using and used the 'sharing' tab to give me full permission and this fixed the problem.\n\nTherefore you might want to check this, or implement this into the error message...\n\nThanks\nTim\n",
