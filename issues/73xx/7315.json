   "body" : "In 0.12, a wallet tx thats not in the mempool does not free up its inputs.  So if a tx spends the same inputs as a conflict tx included in a new block, its inputs are explicitly marked dirty so they will be recalculated as spendable again due to having no non-conflicted spends.  However if the in-block conflict is reorged out, the wallet txs inputs should now be market spent again according to the 0.12 regime, but they are not marked dirty as the tx itself is not notified it is no longer conflicted.\n\nThis has the odd effect that the cached value is incorrect and so randomly they will be spendable or not depending on whether they have been recalculated.\n\nThis is easy enough to fix by marking all inputs of all txs in SyncTransaction dirty regardless of whether AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe returns true or false.  But I'm not sure the performance impact this will have, so I'm not proposing that change now.\n\nIt's a minor issue, but I just thought I'd document that that the cached credit available in wallet txs may not always be correct.\n\nFor reference, in 0.11, whenever a tx left the mempool it's inputs were respendable.  So if a tx was removed due to a conflict in a block, any remaining inputs would be spendable again.  If the in-block conflict was later reorged out, the wallet txs inputs would remain spendable unless and until the wallet tx reentered the mempool.\n",
