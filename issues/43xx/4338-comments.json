If you just created\nthe transaction yourself or mined the block yourself, this is an obvious\ntruth.\n\nSo, alternative proposal: trigger DoS scoring when receiving an\nunadvertized tx/block that you do already have.\n\nPros:\n- Optimizes propagation latency slightly.\n- Is conpatible with all existing behavior in clients afaik.\n\nCons:\n- More complex network rule.\n- Assumes that every peer (or at least every NODE_NETWORK peer) will be\n  interested in the actual tx/block (which is currently likely the case, but\n  we don't know the future variety of network nodes).\n",
