How much header data duplication do you think it's out there?\n\nA much simpler solution would be to create a new class CProtoHeader which lacks hashPrev and which CBlockHeader and CBlockIndex both extend. But that's not saving anything either and it's not particularly beautiful (specially considering that CDiskBlockIndex extends from CBlockIndex but also has hashPrev). \n",

It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5.
