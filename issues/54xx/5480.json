If this is desired, I'm happy to rebase this after #5478's merge.\n\nSince uint256 has .begin() and .size(), I don't see why we should trust that a pointer to the object lines up with the data we're after rather than using those functions.\n\nI did a naive grep to find these, there are likely others as well.\n",
