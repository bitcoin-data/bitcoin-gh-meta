I was wondering if you saw #5202 as there is already some incarnation of maximum fees, I think this is better than the mess that already exists and maybe we can get rid of some of the old ones now.  \n\nOne slight negative of enforcing the minRelayTxFee is this precludes the option to take your chances on relaying, but boost your chances of being included in a block by offering a very small fee.  In practice that probably works right now, but I don't see it as much of a loss.\n",

      "body" : "@morcos Thanks for the review.  I'll go through 5202, I saw that it was there... I'd been not following the fees logic, so I hadn't reviewed it. On this PR I wasn't trying for general improvements just bugfix grade foot-gun prevention.\n\nRe \"take your chance\", well-- I don't believe you'll relay it yourself under this condition, so I think at a minimum something else would need to change. And if we'd relay our own transaction when we wouldn't a third party transaction thats perhaps deanonymizing (which might be fine for some users, but probably shouldn't be a default). If you do want that, you can just lower your relay fee... so you still do have that option.\n\nThe major consideration here is that we handle stuck transactions very poorly; you can end up with a large amount of coins tied up and unspendable. E.g. spend 0.01 btc, your wallet picks a 10 BTC coin, makes an unrelayable transaction...  And now those 10 BTC are unavailable to you days later. There is no user friendly way to abort, you can basically only drop to a commandline, blow away all your wallet metadata, and rescan your wallet. You might not realize you can do this, and you might abandon the funds.  So all this favors being conservative by default when it comes to creating transactions that may not relay at all.\n\nIIRC we do the 'can we send this for free' logic basically looking one block ahead-- since one block isn't an undue burden-- and maybe that should now change to follow the txconfirm target, e.g. if your target is zero we shouldn't be looking ahead. \n",

The flag fSendFreeTransactions which lets you put 0 fee is different than the fAllowFree flag to GetMinRelayFee which is always true and I don't think your decision to relay could distinguish between an intentionally free transaction and one which you just put a below minimum fee on.   Anyway no point to debate it, because I agree with your argument to be conservative.\n\nBut now that I think about it, if its a design goal to allow high priority free transactions to be confirmed (as the default mining code does), then maybe the rate-limiting code should be taking into account priority?
