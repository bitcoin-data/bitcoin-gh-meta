For example by returning the raw transaction in a JSON structure w/ some statistics like the fee from `send*`, then having the client submit it (or even sign+submit) when it agrees. But ofc that's not a quick-fix kind of thing that we can add to 0.10.\n",

As you say, even the 'fee' constraint may be interpreted in different ways. In my philosophy of doing as little as possible in bitcoind it makes sense to make the user evaluate this instead of build an array of possible checks into the server.\n",
