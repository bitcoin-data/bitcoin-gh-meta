Best I can suggest for greater oracle integrity in the near term is remote attest. In general secrecy makes it hard. Oracles implemented as multiparty computation give you what you want, but thats not terribly realistic right now.\n> 17:37 < gmaxwell> (if you go down the rabbit hole of reading about multiparty computation, be aware that the lit is full of stuff under not-very-useful security models, like \"semi-honest\" or \"passive\" security where it's assumed that the participants may try to passively snoop but won't violate the protocol.)\n\netc:\n\n> 14:41 < adam3us> Taek: i agree.  moxie bytecode vm is a cool idea.  for that and some other things also.\n> 14:42 < adam3us> Taek: (other things in bitcoin) eg it can enforce deterministic execution of extensions that are coded in its bytecode.\n\netc http://gnusha.org/bitcoin-wizards/2015-01-09.log\n\n> 19:20 @gmaxwell kanzure: the bytecode of the consensus rules.

If the full transaction data were made available then there would be no limit to what could be done.\n\nBut I agree with @sipa: as a proposed addition to bitcoin core, there are serious deficiencies in this approach with respect to user experience. It would be a regression in base capability for wallets / signers. But it would motivate work on a better, more general and expressive scripting capability.\n",

Or at least, formal verification is just as difficult as other architectures like x86 or ARM.\n\nA possibly better approach is a strongly typed stack language, or other architecture where formal verification isn't as onerous a task. But I think there is value to doing a moxiescript proposal to illuminate these issues.\n\nHowever perhaps you were thinking of some other way in which there are formal verification benefits? I know there is another proposal to have the consensus rules of bitcoin compiled to moxie and use formal verification to prove the moxie interpreter. I believe that will be a fruitful avenue for research as well.\n",
