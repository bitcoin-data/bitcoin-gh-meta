That'd be a bit more automated, but still transparent.\r\n\r\nThat has been suggested before. But at some point a human has to manually execute some steps, and be able to verify them. Gitian is already supposed to automate the process of building in VMs. Automating the creation of VMs to run Gitian may be a step too far (also because this has to work in Windows with VirtualBox)",
