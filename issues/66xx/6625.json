Please, @theuni close #6526 in favor of this if it passes your review.\n\nBlocking:\n- Consensus: Adapt declarations of most obviously consensus functions #6591 [jtimon/consensus-params-0.12.99]\n- Chainparams cleanup #5970 [chainparams_cleanup](depends on #6163)\n- Chainparams: Introduce std::numeric_limits<uint64_t>::max() new testnet chains to test different block sizes #6382 [chainparams-sizetest-0.11.99]\n",
