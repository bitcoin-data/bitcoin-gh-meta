   "body" : "I had a few conflicted transactions in my wallet, so I ran:\n\n```\nbitcoind -zapwallettxes=2\n```\n\nto delete them. After doing so, all my transactions from before January 2014 had a date of January 2014.\n\nUpon checking the source code, I see this line in `CWallet::AddToWallet()` in `wallet/wallet.cpp`:\n\n```\nwtx.nTimeSmart = std::max(latestEntry, std::min(blocktime, latestNow));\n```\n\n`blocktime` is the time I want to see in my transactions, `latestNow` is much bigger, and so the `min()` returns the time I want, but `latestEntry` is January 2014, and so that's the time that is used for all my old transactions.\n\nI'm not entirely clear how the Jan 2014 date is being found, since `-zapwallettxes` is meant to delete all the transactions and rescan to find them again, but it seems that\n\n```\nTxItems txOrdered = OrderedTxItems(acentries);\n```\n\nis finding a transaction from 2014, even after all transactions have been deleted.\n\nI tried replacing the nTimeSmart = max(min()) code with this:\n\n```\nwtx.nTimeSmart = std::min(blocktime, latestNow);\n```\n\nthen re-ran with the -zap flag, and now I see the correct dates next to all of my transactions.\n",
