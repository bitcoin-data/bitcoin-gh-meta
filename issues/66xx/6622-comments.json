If they have a transfer cap, then it is most likely tied to a monthly billing cycle, so MB/month is likely better. (For example, I think Comcast in the US has a 250GB/month cap, so a Comcast customer might like to allow 100GB/month, or something like that.)\n",

Will fix it.\n\nNot sure about limit per month or per day.\nPer month can be difficult because not every month has the same amount of days (30/31/27/28). Also it's unclear how one could get \"in sync\" with providers month rhythm (must not be first to last day of month). Though, it still would allow to use a daily measurement cycle (break down the month limit to days, keep focus on a day limit).\n\nFor now i think keep the day-limit does make things more easy and controllable.\n",

Probably if you connected and download from a throttled peer.\n\nBandwidth throttled peers is not something we should _not_ encourage within bitcoin-core. If a node-operator likes to limit the bandwidth, he can use different tools. What we really should do is reducing bandwidth without impair the network quality and speed. My stats showed me that most traffic is done outbound and most of the outbound traffic is consumed by serving historical blocks (help other nodes to initial sync a new chain).\n\n**This PR can reduce bandwidth significant while not impair the network quality.**\n**An initial sync for a new peer is not something that is very time critical.**\n\nThere was a discussion on #bitcoin-dev about the -maxuploadtarget (gmaxwell, wumpus, me) http://bitcoinstats.com/irc/bitcoin-dev/logs/2015/09/02#l1441180902.0)\n",

Using torrent you are happy to get any transmission speed because it is parallel download anyway.\n\nOn the contrary, bitcoin-core is doing moving-window download (c.f. #4468). So you always want to fetch the blocks from peers which can upload to you not much slower than your download speed?\n\nThis PR makes the full node to disconnect from initial-download-peers instead of serving them at lower speed, which sounds like the better solution to me.\n",

The daily limit (especially with the arbitrary start point) is less of an issue.\n\n@luke-jr Your phone call issue is largely orthogonal to what this is addressing.

My thought where, if one sets a `-maxuploadtarget`, what commands can be dropped without harming the p2p network? Uploading historical blocks and disconnecting SPV nodes.\nIt could make sense to remove the part where maxuploadtarget also affects filtered blocks limiting.\n\nI hope i can generate some statistics that could show the bandwidth consumptions of SPV soon.\n",

The other patch we're discussing on the XT repository solves the problem of inference with consumer services at home due to saturating the limited uplink bandwidth._\n\nBecause it seems to me that these are two independent problems that are both being called 'throttling', and the two approaches can actually be combined, or rather, would not interfere if both were implemented as-is.\n\nTor has a hibernate mode that this sounds very similar to. The way it works is essentially shutting down your node when you go over the transfer quota. Similarly, this patch is equivalent to shutting down part of the node when quota is exhausted, i.e. the part that provides useful services to other peers.\n\nIt might be worth separating the two terms. We could call this one hibernation, and the other patch throttling, as that'd align terminology with Tor and \"throttling\" in network engineering normally means restricting the instantaneous bandwidth usage rather than disconnecting after reaching a daily quota.\n",

That IBD serving is similar to torrent. This is the reason why this PR addresses that part if the upload target has been reached.\n\nThe rest of your points are QoS topics. IMO this is a router job (or a lower level OS net stack thing). Reducing bandwidth by a throttling feature would reduce than bandwidth regardless of what else is going on on the system. It would also reduce bandwidth â which would be available â if the User is creating a backup or writing a letter in Word.\n",
