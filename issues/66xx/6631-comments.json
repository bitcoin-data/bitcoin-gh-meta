But in this case, setting default to 1 is much better because regtest/testnet is being used by people who should know what they are doing.\r\n\r\nWhen calling `generate`, they expect to generate some blocks. In almost all cases (at least this is my usage), one block. So after calling `generate` without arguments, they should reasonably expect at least one block generated (and they see its hash in the returned array).\r\n\r\nSetting the default to one can speed their work (or at least mine), as usually one block is enough.\r\n\r\nBut if you really NACK setting the default to 1, my ACK here, of course. No problem with such decision.",

But the common case in every case you mentioned is one. Generating one block is a typical use-case for every type of user you mentioned.\r\nA miner (see above...) will test 99 blocks and then one to see a difference.\r\nWallet developer will test 5 blocks and then one (if he is testing displaying the number of confirmations, he will even generate one by one...).\r\n\r\nBut as I said above, I can live with being explicit.
