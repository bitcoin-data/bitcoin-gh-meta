But I thought I'd open this issue to at least document it. I was using `bitcoin-cli` to test the Java server when I discovered this issue. \r\n\r\nI'll try the new bitcoin-cli when it is merged in to `master`. I have written (with help from @dexX7 ) a Java Bitcoin RPC client and RegTest-mode integration tests for some of the RPCs. I'm in the process of moving the code from [OmniLayer/OmniJ](https://github.com/OmniLayer/OmniJ) to [msgilligan/bitcoinj-addons](https://github.com/msgilligan/bitcoinj-addons).  You may want to consider running the client and integration tests against the new server implementation. Sometimes running a different implementation of the client can bring out issues in the server.",
