In blocks, latencies in the mining process usually make their times tens of seconds off (and misconfigurations make them minutes off).\r\n\r\nThe network also has infinite gain, e.g. there is no inherent bias to drive it back in sync with UTC except for corner case limitations in the correction procedure.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we do not use the time in any ways in which precision is important. (which is also fortunate because making it precise and consistent without centralization is an unsolved problem!)\r\n\r\nGiven that, I am not sure that an offset of even as much as 20000 microseconds is at all interesting.\r\n\r\nAre you aware of a case where this matters?",
