I'm seeing frequent blocks that are significantly smaller than the maximum block size, so it's looking like there's space in the block chain for these transactions, isn't there?\n\nI'm currently working on a patch that will give users the option to not relay blocks from stingy miners. I think this is the best way as a community we can recover the ability to reduce tx fees.\n",

With some code changes, it should be possible to delay the propagation of the smaller blocks so that they don't have this advantage. Also, in order to keep tx fees lower, giving priority to blocks which include more txs would help to incentivise miners to include more transactions. Given the amount of tx traffic currently, it surely makes more sense to reduce the number of empty blocks still being accepted into the blockchain.\n",
