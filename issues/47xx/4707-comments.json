This is a regression from 6b099402b40dcf9fc716be29c85e7e1865b28e92\n\nAfter a quick chat on irc: @randy-waterhouse has his openssl headers in a non-standard place, but one that's found by pkg-config. Other devs (myself included) haven't noticed these CPPFLAGS missing because the openssl paths get lumped in with the others (usually at /usr/include or so).\n",
