I don't like these globals, maybe a singleton factory for mapBlockIndexClass instead with all its CCriticalSection inside?\nOf course that would be another PR, but it's kind of related (remember I was moving mapBlockIndex to chain at first) and I keep thinking about it... \n",

But I'm heavily opposed to anything involving singletons. That just moves from one way of having side effects and hiding dependencies between modules to another one. It looks 'object oriented' and allows some more flexibility in initialization/destruction order but in the end it is the same thing. For that reason, the singleton pattern has become quite controversial.\n",
