The problem is that autotools forces you to list each file rather than globbing, which is a really really good thing. That prevents stray files from slipping into release tarballs.\n\nTo fix in an upstreamable way, we'd have to split their makefile up into 2 files, one which just lists sources, and the other to handle build logic. We would include the first from one of our Makefiles. From their POV, there would be no compelling reason to accept that.\n\nMore realistically, we'd just enumerate those files ourselves. Anything left out would not be copied to our release tarballs, so builds would fail. Since we update leveldb very rarely anyway, I think it'd be a reasonable burden to take on.\n",

The wording [here](https://www.flameeyes.eu/autotools-mythbuster/autoconf/macros.html) led me to believe that the system m4 would have precedence, but an 'aclocal --verbose' indeed shows our file being used first.\n\nThat being said, I'm not willing to break build on some platforms just for some \"neatness\". Surely we can use an ifndef on one of the pkg-config macros to determine if we need to user our own file or not?\n",

It's looking like Apple is moving to make 10.9 the new minimum dev requirement as quickly as possible, and I want to be sure we're ready for that. I've got the cross and native build up and running with recent clang and 10.9 sdk (still 10.6 minimum runtime, so no user-facing changes other than better functionality on newer OSs).\n\nPoint being: when we're looking to bump up our minimum required dev environment, I have no problem dropping these kind of compat workarounds.

A quick googling turns up lots of hits like this one: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8578181/using-the-pkg-config-macro-pkg-check-modules-failing\n\nAgain, if you're going to argue that it's reasonable to remove some functionality that someone may be relying on that's perfectly fine and I could most definitely be persuaded. But you still haven't given a tangible benefit other than \"the code is tidier\". I get that using the system m4 is the correct thing to do. I really do. But if there's no tangible benefit, then that point carries no weight.\n\nAt this point I really don't care because this is a silly thing to be arguing over. Ultimately, I just really dislike the \"maybe break a working thing for the sake of technical correctness\" type of changes.\n",
