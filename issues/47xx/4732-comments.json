It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n\nThis test script verifies pulls every time they are updated. It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.  If you are waiting on a test, please check timestamps to verify that the test.log is moving at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/current/\nContact BlueMatt on freenode if something looks broken.\n",

We suggest creating another regression testing network parameters, called MAIN_REGTEST that inherits from MAIN and it just changes the block difficulty.\nThen we won't need any modification on the previous test-cases, because all of them will use the same MAIN parameters as the MAIN_REGTEST.\n\nTo summarize this pull request and  #4688 we have 4 possibilities:\n1. Let the test framework run in MAIN and add the suppression of block work global variable (this is #4688). Problem: some do not like adding this variable.\n2. Switch the framework to REGTEST. Problem: some test cases use MAIN parameters and we don't want to break the REGTEST codes of other Bitcoin implementations.\n3. Keep using MAIN for the test framework. Problem: Is ugly. Needs mining. Makes debugging harder. GMaxwell thinks MAIN was not intended for the testing framework, but REGTEST was.\n4. Switch the framework to a new MAIN_REGTEST network inheriting from MAIN, but sets difficulty to zero. Very simple. Add 10 lines of code. Everything keeps working as is. Does not break anything. \n\nI still think that 1 was the best choice.\nBut from peoples comments I suppose number 4 would be an consented choice.\n",

But one must take into account that switching network parameters is only possible for test cases that do not call ProcessBlock(). All test cases that call ProcessBlock() must probably share the same parameters to prevent incompatibilities (which is not that bad) . If we'd really like complete free control of the block-chain for each unit test, then we would need to incorporate the block-chain destroy/creation code present in #4688.\n",
