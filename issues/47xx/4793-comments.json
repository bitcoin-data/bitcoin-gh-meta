      "body" : "@laanwj instead of checking for the overflow of the nNonce, the magic 1000 is used. This does not check all possible values of the nonce before changing the extra nonce, but that shouldn't be a problem.\r\nIt can be make a constant, sure. I was hoping that @sipa @luke-jr or someone less lazy than me for base conversions and hexadecimal would say something like \"since ScanHash returns false when ```pblock->nNonce & 0xfff) == 0``` you can safely change the 1000 for X and we will still exhaust all the possibilities with the 32 bits of the nonce\"..\r\nWe should probably make that 0xfff a constant as well. Any suggestions for the constants are welcomed.\r\n\r\nThe PR has many comments about the removal of the hashmeter, which was originally part of this, but was already merged separately.\r\nThis was part of the effort to encapsulate the proof of work and it reduces the number of places in mining where nBits and nNonce are used.\r\nIt should also make regtest slightly faster, but I haven't tested that. It also makes regtest and non-regtest mining more similar.\r\n",
