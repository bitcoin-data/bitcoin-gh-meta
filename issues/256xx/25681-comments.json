Though Cirrus CI is always running, it seems to run tests instead of checking the build process. FYI, I can find a Dockerfile in https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/bitcoin-core/Dockerfile.",

      "body" : "@luke-jr thank you for the support. However, after making a separate repo I like it that way. I think it is just as convenient as in repo, and in some cases actually better because it is easy to build an older version. The reason to put it in repo is for it to be more official and to try to ensure a better review process. However, a Dockerfile is easy to audit, and the demand for this approach is unknown right now.\r\n\r\nI would still like to create a document linking to different community efforts at Docker builds.",
