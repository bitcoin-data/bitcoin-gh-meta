This implementation is a follow up for the same, this implementation provides following enhancement to the RPC\r\n            - For every transaction, say tx1, in the input list, a list of unconfirmed transactions in the wallet which conflict with tx1\r\n            - For every transaction, say tx2, in the input list, a list of transactions in the same list which conflict with tx2\r\n            - In case the user provides a transaction more than once, after first occurrence, rest occurrences are ignored and the index(0-based) for such transactions is reported to the user\r\n    See also: [PR#22751](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22751/)",
