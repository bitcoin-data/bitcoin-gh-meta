   "body" : "This is a draft PR trying to make some improvements to the `BResult` class to make it more usable. Adds a `util::Result` class with the following improvements (and implements `BResult` in terms of it so existing code doesn't have to change):\r\n\r\n- Supports returning error strings and error information at the same time. This functionality is needed by the `LoadChainstate` function in #25308 or any function that can fail in multiple ways which need to be handled differently. And it means Result class is compatible with rust-style error handling and pattern matching, unlike BResult.\r\n\r\n- Makes Result class provide same operators and methods as std::optional, so it doesn't require calling less familiar `HasRes`/`GetObj`/`ReleaseObj` methods, and so error reporting functionality can be easily added or dropped from existing code by switching between util::Result and std::optional.\r\n\r\n- Supports `Result<void>` return values, so it is possible to return error reporting information from functions in a uniform way even if they don't have other return values.\r\n\r\n- Supports `Result<bilingual_str>` return values. Drops ambiguous and potentially misleading `BResult` constructor that treats any bilingual string as an error, and any other type as a non-error. Adds `util::Error` constructor so errors have to be explicitly constructed and not any `bilingual_str` will be turned into one.\r\n\r\n- Puts `src/util/` code in the `util::` namespace so naming reflects code organization and it is obvious where the class is coming from. Drops \"B\" from name because it is undocumented what it stands for (bilingual?)\r\n\r\n- Adds unit tests.",
