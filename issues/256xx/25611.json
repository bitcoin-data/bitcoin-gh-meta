This is unintuitive for developers and forces them to write\r\nverbose and brittle code. (Refer to `-Wnarrowing` compiler warning)\r\n\r\nFor example, there are many places where an unsigned int is cast to a\r\nsigned int. While the cast is safe in practice, it is still needlessly\r\nverbose and confusing as the value can never be negative. In fact it\r\nmight even be unsafe if the unsigned value is large enough to map to a\r\nnegative signed one.\r\n\r\nFix this issue and other (minor) type issues.",
