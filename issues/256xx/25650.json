   "body" : "Almost every time I need to use this script, I forget the tag list is needed and that a specific set of tags is needed for the backwards compatibility tests to work. I end up wasting time reading through the script and googling to find the tag list before remembering it is in `test/README.md`\r\n\r\nI assume (hope) I'm not the only one this happens to, so I figured it would make more sense to have the script default to downloading/building the necessary tags. This has the added benefit of making the script the source of truth: the script already needs to be updated with the SHA256_SUM of the binary for every new tag that is added, so it makes sense to use `SHA256_SUMS` list as the necessary tag list. This means there is less risk of the README and the script drifting (i.e updating the readme with a new tag and forgetting to update the script, or updating the script and forgetting to update the README). Now all that needs to happen is to update the `SHA256_SUMS` list in the script and everything Just Works (TM)\r\n",
