   "body" : "Finishing the encapsulation work started in #25337.\r\n\r\n#### Context\r\n\r\nWe are currently using the address book for different purposes and features in the wallet such us:\r\n\r\n1) Store and retrieve own receive addresses with a label.\r\n2) Store and retrieve external addresses with a label.\r\n3) Store and retrieve payment requests.\r\n4) Mark addresses/destinations as 'used' if they appear on the blockchain (part of the âavoid re-useâ feature).\r\n5) Know whether an output is a change or not based on the encoded script.\r\n\r\nSome of these points arenât well known by many because this code has been spread and obfuscated across the walletâs sources. (and created in a Frankenstein style).\r\n\r\n#### PR Goals\r\n\r\nEncapsulate the address book functionalities into its own `AddressBookManager` class, so we are able to distinguish properly the address book responsibilities and capabilities.\r\n\r\nCreate a new class that can be easily upgraded/replaced, and even different implementations can be used in parallel in different local wallets, by just providing a different manager instance to the wallet in the constructor.\r\n\r\nBe able to decouple the address book dependency on the walletâs main mutex (up to a certain point, because we are still using the same db connection).\r\nClean up the wallet sources further.\r\nAnd be able to unit/fuzz test the address book manager implementation isolated from the wallet flows.\r\n\r\n#### Next steps\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, will be working on improve the âchange outputâ flow which, at least for now, is strictly connected to this process (goal will be to remove the strict dependency).\r\n\r\n#### Pending work (still under WIP, almost there)\r\n\r\n* [ ] Add manager class description.\r\n* [Â ] Clean CAddressBookData.\r\n* [ ] Cover the class with unit tests.\r\n* [ ] Double-check commits order.\r\n* [ ] Add addrbook purposes enum.\r\n* [ ] Make cs_addrbook RecursiveMutex a Mutex?\r\n",
