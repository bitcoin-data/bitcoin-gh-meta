   "body" : "`mempoolfullrbf` allows a node to accept replace-by-fee transactions without requiring replaceability signaling. While the replacement transaction is locally accepted, it should be rejected by all your opt-in rbf peers, the default behavior. As such, the odds are low the replacement transaction propagates to miners, unless there are full-rbf transaction-relay paths existent between the node and those miners mempools.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve this issue by enabling the setting of full-rbf transaction-relay link, in both manual and automated fashions. \r\n\r\nThe first commit introduces a `NODE_REPLACE_BY_FEE` service flag to advertise support of full-rbf to our peers if [`mempoolfullrbf`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25353) is set to true. From the results of `getpeerinfo` or `getnetworkinfo`, a node operator can find full-rbf peers on the p2p network to which to manually connect to. The service flag bit select is the 26th one to be compatible with previous full-rbf [experiences](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-June/020570.html).\r\n\r\nThe second commit introduces a `ConnectionType::FULLRBF` if `mempoolfullrbf` is set to true. In `ThreadOpenConnections`, we attempt to keep opened at least 4 outbound full-rbf transaction-relay peer. An outbound full-rbf relay peer is considered as one signaling `NODE_REPLACE_BY_FEE` service flag.\r\n\r\nI think if we have concerns on the network-wise resources consumption from those new outbound full-rbf relay peers, we could deduce them `MAX_ADNNODE_CONNECTIONS`. It should be weighted if we have other concerns about the implications on transaction-relay topology robustness or any spying peers flagging themselves as `NODE_REPLACE_BY_FEE` to attract early full-rbf traffic. What else ?\r\n\r\nI don't hold to the approach re-using the current automatic connection logic in `ThreadOpenConnections`, if there are others ones I'm interested to consider them. I can split the PR in two, if automatic connection requires more thinking.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- add functional tests\r\n- make `MAX_FULLRBF_RELAY_CONNECTIONS` configurable up to `MAX_ADDNODE_CONNECTIONS` ?\r\n- make automatic connection its own boolean setting ?",
