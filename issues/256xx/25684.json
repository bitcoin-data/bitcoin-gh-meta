   "body" : "Got unexpected behavior when trying to run bitcoind with -proxy setting.\r\n-proxy is used to connect to SOCKS5 proxy which is able to access some internal network.\r\nbitcoind is started with -noconnect option and network activity is absent (as it should be).\r\n\r\nThen I command bitcoin-cli to connect to node with address 10.x.y.z with the command\r\n`bitcoin-cli addnode 10.x.y.z add`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior** is for bitcoind to initiate connection through proxy.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior** is bitcoind trying to connect without using proxy.\r\n\r\nIn the code:\r\n`CConnman::ConnectNode` calls GetProxy and GetProxy returns false because `CNetAddr::GetNetwork` returns NET_UNROUTABLE.\r\n\r\nMy take is this is unexpected behavior at minimum and should be documented.\r\nBetter way is to introduce another option just for the unroutable addresses:\r\n- connect locally (for compatibility reasons, default);\r\n- connect thru proxy;\r\n- don't connect to unroutable addresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
