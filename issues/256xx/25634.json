   "body" : "The `blank` wallet flag is used to indicate that the wallet intentionally does not have any keys, scripts, or descriptors, and it prevents the automatic generation of those things for such a wallet. Once the wallet contains any of those data, it is unnecessary, and possibly incorrect, to have `blank` set. This PR fixes a few places where this was not properly happening. It also adds a test for this unset behavior.\r\n\r\nAdditionally it unifies the behavior of the RPC with the GUI in that setting `disable_private_keys` will also automatically set `blank`. However, for backwards compatibility, users can choose to override this in the RPC by doing `blank=False`.",
