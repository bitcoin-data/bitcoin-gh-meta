   "body" : "if a transaction is being funded that has an external input, and that input's parent is also in the wallet, we will fail to detect that and fail to fund the transaction. In order to correctly detect such inputs, we need to be doing `IsMine` on all specified inputs in order to use `Select` and `SelectExternal` correctly. Additionally `SelectCoins` needs to call `CalculateMaximumSignedInputSize` with the correct parameters which depends on whether the wallet is able to solve for the input. Because there are some situations where the wallet could find an external input to belong to it (e.g. watching an address - unable to solve, but will be ISMINE_WATCHONLY), instead of switching which `CalculateMaximumSignedInputSize` to use, we should call the one that uses the wallet, and if that fails, try again with the one that uses external solving data.\r\n\r\nAlso adds a test for this case.",
