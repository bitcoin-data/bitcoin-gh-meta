Could you maybe summarize the issue and suggest possible ways it could be fixed?\r\n\r\nIIUC, it seems like the problem is that `FlushStateToDisk` only flushes the last undo file, even though earlier undo files may need to be flushed as well. Both block files and undo files are numbered based on the order blocks are downloaded, but block files are written in the order blocks are _downloaded_ while undo files are written in the order blocks are _validated_, and the order blocks are downloaded is not the same as the order blocks are validated. So it is sufficient for `FlushStateToDisk` to only flush the highest numbered block file, but not sufficient for it to only flush the most highest numbered undo file, since lower-numbered undo files may have been written to as blocks were validated.",

      "body" : "That's a good summary.\r\n\r\nIf a block is being connected and the undo file's number is not `m_last_blockfile`, `WriteUndoDataForBlock` may not flush the undo file if the block in question isn't the last height in the corresponding block file. `FlushStateToDisk` won't flush this undo file either, but will flush the `BLOCK_HAVE_UNDO` status flag.\r\n\r\nI think the fix would be for `FlushStateToDisk` to flush any undo files that were written to that resulted in the `BLOCK_HAVE_UNDO` status flag being set.\r\n\r\nNote that since this lower-numbered undo file is given to the OS, it should eventually be flushed to disk in the happy path. So the issue would arise when `FlushStateToDisk` completes followed by a power loss/disruptive event _while_ the lower-numbered undo file hasn't been flushed by the OS.",
