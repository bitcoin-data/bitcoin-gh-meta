I also had to \"fill in\" a little bit of procedure on things I couldn't find reference for, but very open to feedback if I've missed the mark somehow in those areas.\r\n\r\nI've tried largely to keep it informal, with \"shoulds\" and \"mays\" aplently, but over time we might change these to be required behaviors/procedures.",
