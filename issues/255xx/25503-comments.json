I think that would work, the only drawback is possibly that tests could slow down due to the quite high number of outputs (>1400 for reaching the same txouts serialized size in `gen_return_txouts` (vs. 128 on master and 1 on this PR), almost 20k outputs in a block generated by `mine_large_block`) and the need to add them all to the UTXO set. Will try out the next days if that's a viable way.",
