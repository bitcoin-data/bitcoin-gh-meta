   "body" : "This is an implementation of https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0135.mediawiki .\r\n\r\nIt extends the BIP9 state machine processing with configurable per-bit window size, activation threshold and grace period parameters (minlockedblocks and minlockedtime).\r\n\r\nThe built-in deployments are parameterized to maintain backward compatibility, and the existing BIP9 tests are retained unmodified except for a minor fix made to `versionbits_tests` to improve the disjointness checks for configured bits).\r\n\r\nA `bip135_forks` section has been added to the `getblockchaininfo` RPC output, leaving the existing `bip9_softforks` section for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nThe check for 'unknown versions being mined' has been altered to take into account that for unknown bits, we can no longer rely on a 95% activation threshold. The `p2p-versionbits-warning` test has been modified accordingly - the new logic warns when an unknown bit exceeds 50/100 of the last blocks.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This implementation contains a specific feature which is not covered by the specification (and thus not strictly required for BIP135): the optional loading of fork configuration from a CSV file (using `-forks=datafile` command line option) and the ability to dump out the built-in configuration in CSV format (`-dumpforks` option). This has been retained from the original reference implementation since it makes testing and adaptation of the configuration easier.",
