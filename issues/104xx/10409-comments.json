More specifically it adds fuzzing of the deserialization code for `BlockTransactions`, `BlockTransactionsRequest` and `CBlockHeaderAndShortTxIDs`.\r\n\r\nDo you think it might be getting ready for merge?\r\n\r\nWhen this PR is merged I'll look into having command-line argument determine the type of fuzzer as suggested in #11045.\r\n\r\n",
