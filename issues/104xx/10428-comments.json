Activation is done by economic majority, the reason one may want to use an optional parameter is because measuring if the network has reached a suitable economic majority is not as straight forward as measuring signalling blocks, one should activate the flag once they are confident a suitable percentage of the economy intends to activate the flag. The fork is convergent as long as there is an economic majority or miner majority backing it since miners ultimately mine the most profitable chain. A hard fork like BIP102 however is never convergent.",

I mean no disrespect, but take issue with the concept not the implementation. \r\n\r\nAs for 'dangerous' or 'experimental', I find it somewhat hypocritical that there is support for this, but no support for doing similar for bip100/bip102 or EC which are arguably just as dangerous. Thus I would think it would be better if there was a general means of signalling support for bips (including segwit) rather then just the odd implementation for one off cases such as this. So I would think that your code should be made generic in parts to support a range of signalling for BIPS. \r\n\r\nI also think that as there is a 'start date' for this, there should also be an 'end date' so that if it fails it is not active in the codebase forever.  Would you consider an end date of 2 months(?) as a change to the code? ",

BIP 148 nodes will disconnect from (and ban IIRC) non-BIP 148 nodes after they relay a number of bip148-invalid blocks. non-BIP 148 nodes will still be able to connect to other non-BIP 148 nodes and maintain a separate non-BIP148 blockchain. Node's won't be crashing or doing anything that would \"bring down the network\".\r\n\r\nThere would be risk for transaction replay and for blockchain reorganizations. The miners are incentivised to use BIP 148 the BIP 148 chain will not be able to be wiped out by the non-BIP 148 chain. However the opposite of that is true; the non-BIP 148 chain could be wiped out by the BIP 148 chain if it were to be longer than it.\r\n\r\nAnyways, you should read the \"petty document\" since it does explain a lot of this stuff.",

What makes a soft fork \"soft\" is that non-upgraded nodes continue on the same chain and consider the new rules valid.  Without 50% of hashing power behind it, a UASF will cause a chain split.  Old nodes will be on the \"wrong\" chain, and new nodes will be on another chain.\r\n\r\nThe fact that much development and care has gone into segwit is NOT an argument for adopting it.  That's a sunken cost fallacy.  Not insignificant chunks of the miners, users, and economic actors seem to be opposed it.  Their reasons and motivation is not relevant.  All that matters is that segwit does not have near-universal acceptance, which has always been the standard for upgrading the protocol.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to merge in options that allow users to break off onto a different chain under not-unlikely scenarios, why not also add in non-segwit base blocksize increases as options too?  Or how about a  pow=sha3  switch?  Heck, let's just make it a barebones non-descript PoW blockchain client and have the users set all the consensus parameters they want.  Then their client will only connect to whatever chain they want to be on.  I mean, if the consensus chain doesn't require unanimous consensus, why not?  There's no harm if we're now claiming that converging onto one chain isn't important.",

BIP 148 carries high, unnecessary risk of a chain split, as has been discussed on the [mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-April/014152.html).  This project has always held high standards for deploying consensus-changing proposals while minimizing risks to consensus splits.  In my view, BIP 148 as drafted is incompatible with the goals of this project, and putting it behind a command line option does not address the fundamental nature of this incompatibility.  (I'll refrain from posting further on BIP 148 as I agree that GitHub is not the best place for these discussions but as this is my primary objection to this PR I see no other choice but to make some mention of it here.  I'll take further analysis of these concerns to the mailing list.)\r\n\r\n[There are also technical issues with this PR -- such as the peering concerns raised by @maaku (which are completely correct), and the lack of inclusion of any tests for this code.

Also, this PR is not \"for bip148\" - it is an effort to prevent bitcoin fragmenting and protect exchanges from the negative consequences of a reorg.   \r\n\r\nRight now 10% of the nodes on the network are running non-core UASF code - including SPV wallet nodes and some small exchanges.   Failing to protect users and miners by providing an *option* that puts them on the side of the fork that's less likely to encounter a reorg seems irresponsible.   \r\n\r\nIf the current trend continues, and we try to roll something out as a last minute reaction - it could be too late to protect our most important users.   Having it as an option allows users to enable it if needed to side with whatever the majority may be.   If it comes to that, we can enable it by default, and make an announcement that people should either recompile or enable the option.  Or the reverse:  remove it from the code base and announce it will no longer be supported.",

Otherwise the network could become partitioned on Aug 1st.\r\n\r\n@maaku This is no different from any other softfork. Unlike Segwit, there isn't a stripped block to be avoided. Perhaps some mechanism like this could be an improvement, but it probably isn't necessary, and can't be secure against sybil attacks anyway.\r\n\r\n@RHavar BIP148 is indeed truly the lower-risk option.\r\n\r\n> While the answer to that question can be vague, but more importantly we should decide when does not merging UASF by default becomes a bigger systemic risk than merging it?\r\n\r\n@nopara73 It is *already* a bigger risk to not merge BIP148, than to merge it.\r\n\r\n> This can be implemented on top of -blocknotify and RPC invalidateblock, and useragent change without this dangerous modification. Any volunteer to contribute this solution?\r\n\r\n@paveljanik Why should Core require an external script/program to remain a fully validating node?\r\n\r\n> Correct me if I'm wrong, but in case of long coexistance of two chains, and then BIP148 chain overpowering the old one, wouldn't it cause very long reorg?\r\n\r\n@mcgravier Only for non-full nodes (ie, failing to enforce BIP148). This is always and already a risk if miners create long invalid blockchains, it isn't a new thing introduced by BIP148 specifically. It is normal in a softfork that old nodes have this risk.\r\n\r\n> @jameshilliard back to the code. This change allows for an 'eclipse' style attack as you have suggested. As such it does have to do with node counts. \r\n\r\n@AllanDoensen What are you talking about? The code doesn't do anything you describe. Why do you pretend to read the code, when what you're saying has nothing to do with what the code actually does??\r\n\r\n> BIP 148 carries high, unnecessary risk of a chain split, as has been discussed on the mailing list.\r\n\r\n@sdaftuar As with any softfork, miners who create long invalid blockchains violating the rules can cause a chain split. Such a chain split is not caused by BIP 148, but by non-compliant miners creating invalid blocks. Furthermore, this risk is strictly *reduced* by increased adoption of the softfork, since it becomes less economically viable for miners to go on producing these invalid blocks very long.\r\n\r\n@earonesty This PR should be closed and rebased against master.",
