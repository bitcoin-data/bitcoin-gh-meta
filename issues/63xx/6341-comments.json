For instance, Gavin has never given any details about testing; at minimum we'd need a BIP16 style quality assurance document. We also frown on writing software with building expiration dates, let alone expiration dates that trigger non-deterministically. (Note how my recently merged CLTV considered the year 2038 problem to avoid needing a hard fork at that date)\n\nUntil these issues are addressed I an many other contributors will be muting this thread and ignoring comments until the BIP itself is fixed. Much of the discussion we see in conversations around this subject is highly repetitive and a big timesink; don't interpret silence as agreement.\n",

We're still in the \"move things around so we can do something useful\" part and not quite to the \"what useful things to do and how\" part.\n\nIn particular for this PR, consensus functions need to work statelessly, so something like CheckTransaction() should have deterministic results depending only on its parameters and chainparam constants. That is a work-in-progress atm, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6051 as an example of the current momentum. FWIW, that's why we've started passing chainparams and consensusparams around everywhere.\n\nFor the scope of this PR i don't think it's necessary to worry about that too much, but it'd be nice if it didn't make chainparams itself stateful.\n\nThat said, these new vars/functions probably belong in consensus/params.h rather than chainparams anyway; that's the new home for consensus-critical stuff.\n\nI'd prefer to see something like:\n\n``` patch\ndiff --git a/src/consensus/params.h b/src/consensus/params.h\nindex c480a1c..b4b97f6 100644\n--- a/src/consensus/params.h\n+++ b/src/consensus/params.h\n@@ -24,7 +24,22 @@ struct Params {\n     bool fPowAllowMinDifficultyBlocks;\n     int64_t nPowTargetSpacing;\n     int64_t nPowTargetTimespan;\n+\n+    /** Maximum block size parameters */\n+    uint32_t nMaxSizePreFork;\n+    uint64_t nEarliestSizeForkTime;\n+    uint32_t nSizeDoubleEpoch;\n+    uint64_t nMaxSizeBase;\n+    uint8_t nMaxSizeDoublings;\n+    int nActivateSizeForkMajority;\n+    uint64_t nSizeForkGracePeriod;\n+\n     int64_t DifficultyAdjustmentInterval() const { return nPowTargetTimespan / nPowTargetSpacing; }\n+    uint64_t MaxTransactionSize(uint64_t nBlockTimestamp, uint64_t nForkTime) const { ... };\n+    uint64_t MaxBlockSize(uint64_t nBlockTimestamp, uint64_t nForkTime) const { ... };\n+    uint64_t MaxBlockSigops(uint64_t nBlockTimestamp, uint64_t nForkTime) const { return MaxBlockSize(nBlockTimestamp, nForkTime)/50; }\n+\n+    }\n };\n } // namespace Consensus\n\n```\n",

Before: Send a block message > 2 MB: you get immediately disconnected (but not banned). Between 1 and 2MB: CheckBlock() would call Misbehaving() and you might get disconnected/banned (if not whitelisted).\n\nWith this pull request: any oversize block will get you immediately disconnected.\n\nI started to make the behavior more consistent... but it's complicated because Misbehaving() requires the cs_main lock be held, but the SanityCheckMessage() callback is deep inside the network-servicing code with cs_vRecvMsg lock held.  Untangling that is, I think, a project for another day. \n\n... ah, except the java comparison tool doesn't like being disconnected when it sends a big block. That's why Travis is failing.\n",
