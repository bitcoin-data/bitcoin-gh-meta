These kinds of modifications are at present unnecessarily complex and conflicting (eg, RBF+ljr+XT don't merge cleanly). Furthermore, alerts currently need to target very specific user-agent strings, so having them split in a logical vector makes it possible (in a \"step 2\" PR) to match an alert for /Satoshi:x.y.z/ against all derived codebases it affects, rather than need to sign an independent alert for every possible variant.",

Let's just make the extra version easy to patch, but the extra machinery around it doesn't seem worth the extra complexity just to avoid a trivial merge conflict.\r\n\r\nAs for alerts, if the alert system in its current form survives at all it's not going to be used for anything that fine-grained, just network-wide alerts. Specific software can have its own mechanisms (this has been discussed in various other issues).",
