Thus when building bitcoin-qt, the system qconfig.h gets included, which among other potential problems makes it think it's dynamic and omit the plugins.\r\n\r\nIf you have cycles to burn you can try replicating my CPATH hack from gitian-linux.yml.

Gitian builds included.\r\n\r\nI've confirmed that the Linux include order is still ok. I'm not entirely happy about the osx print workaround, but everything seems to work.\r\n\r\nAs for jumping to 5.5 that's fine too when it's out+stable, but I don't think we need to hold up this bump for it.\r\n\r\nEdit: I didn't realize that 5.5 was already released. I'm grabbing now to see if it's a smooth bump on top of the work here.",
