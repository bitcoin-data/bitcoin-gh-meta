      "body" : "@dgenr8 I was more concerned with this belonging in the consensus library than anything else. We've been trying to detach methods from the base transaction data structures esp. those not used in consensus for a while. So this was a clear step in the wrong way.\r\n\r\nIf you do want to use it outside the wallet there are other solutions. Most straightforward is to make it an utility function that is not bound to any class:\r\n```c++\r\nbool AreTransactionsEquivalent(const CTransaction& txa, const CTransaction& txb) const\r\n{\r\n   CMutableTransaction tx1 = txa;\r\n   CMutableTransaction tx2 = txb;\r\n   for (unsigned int i = 0; i < tx1.vin.size(); i++) tx1.vin[i].scriptSig = CScript();\r\n   for (unsigned int i = 0; i < tx2.vin.size(); i++) tx2.vin[i].scriptSig = CScript();\r\n   return CTransaction(tx1) == CTransaction(tx2);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n... but I wouldn't know where exactly to put it, then. Probably with other utility functions used for policy and wallet only.\r\n\r\nUnless you have a good suggestion where to put it now, I'd say we should move ahead with this and then you can solve the issue in #4570 (if we are still going to merge that).",
