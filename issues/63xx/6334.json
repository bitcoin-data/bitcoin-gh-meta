   "body" : "This modification solves my problem with bootstrapping nodes on small and slow virtual servers. It introduces a new command line flag -skiptxcheck that will significantly increase speed of initial synchronization in exchange to rely on trust provided by the miners. Because we can believe that every block in deep history of the Bitcoin is valid and contains valid transactions, it is not necesery to verify them again.\n\nThe flag doesn't affect verifying of block header - so block hash and merkle tree are still checked and they must be valid in the chain.\n\nIs there any security risk? I don't think so, maybe little. Standard SPV client always rely on neighbour node. It just verifies the headers, never transactions again.\n\nThis feature automatically disables itself when synchronization is done (not tested yet). Also NODE_NETWORK is disabled.\n",
