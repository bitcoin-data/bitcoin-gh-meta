For instance, even something as simple as miners increasing the minimum relay on their own nodes can be easily exploited for double-spends; a few do right now, which makes accepting zeroconf transactions with lowish fees very dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn short, I think you can make a good argument that this patch is actually a prerequisite to modular mempool policy.\r\n\r\nFWIW the patch does include a way to disable full-RBF indefinitely if the user chooses too by setting -fullrbfactivationtime=2147483647 Should I document this command-line argument and provide a more ergonomic way of doing it, like setting the activation time to -1 or 0 to disable? Heck, could call it -fullrbf with =0 being disabled, =1 enabled, and =<time> to set the switchover time manually.",

That means we can support multiple configurable policies simultaneously without causing consensus forks. Other implementations can of course maintain their own policies (a single one or several of them, that's up to their maintainers).\r\n\r\n@petertodd travis is not happy\r\n\r\nI don't like a switch-over date here. Policy doesn't require that kind of coordination. If full-RBF is going to be the default policy, just make it so for a  given major release and that's it. In the meantime I think we can just merged disabled by default. Or my preference, wait until we can select different policies #5180 (which is easy to review after #6335 and trivial to review after #6068) to merge this.\r\nAnd then just change the default at any later major release.",

Unfortunately we have the problem that there's no way to get transactions to all but the largest, most centralized, miners other than via the p2p network. Without some pretty major changes to how that network works (e.g. hashcash) any transactions that aren't propagated by the majority of relay nodes just aren't going anywhere - why I had to define a RBF service bit and include a bunch of hacky preferential peering code in my full-RBF patch series.\r\n\r\nOne way to look at full-RBF is it's a common-denominator policy that supports other policies; full-RBF provides opportunities to get a larger range of transactions to miners who in turn may have their own policies in a DoS-resistant way by the simple measure of requiring fees to increase on each replacement, and it's significantly more efficient at doing that FSS-RBF. From a mining policy point of view, because it allows transactions to propagate that previously wouldn't have, it reduces the impact of the default policy on what miners can mine and what users can generate. Of course, from a code point of view I'd be happy to port it later to a pluggable policy system, but in the meantime, the code in this pull-req is well-tested and well-reviewed.\r\n\r\nAnyway, re: a switch-over date, in many ways that's us, as Bitcoin Core maintainers, saying \"by this date stop assuming everyone has the same mempool policy\" - the opposite approach of first-seen-dependent zeroconf requires nodes/miners to implement uniform policies to even begin to work. You are of course free to turn full-RBF off and I've made it easy to do so.\r\n\r\nre: travis, yeah, looks like it's broken again; other pull-reqs are failing too.",

(where \"we're\" refers to miners to choose to take the advice of the Bitcoin Core maintainers and leave the default settings as-is)\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to enable full-RBF for all relay nodes, and force miners to make a choice. (e.g. by disabling getblocktemplate until some kind of config setting was enabled) Ugly from a usability point of view, but doable. There's also a risk of DoS attack by doing that, as if very few miners support full-RBF you can fill up mempools/use-up-bandwidth with transactions that are unlikely to be mined. (same problem with double-spend relaying)",

      "body" : "I just want to chime in from a payment processor (Coinbase) point of view. Full RBF is bad for Coinbase and bad for Bitcoin. If full RBF is turned on today by even a small set of nodes, Coinbase will have to stop accepting 0-conf for all orders. That means customers will need to wait for ~10 minutes for their order to confirm. This makes the checkout experience much worse than existing payment methods. It's hard enough trying to convince consumers and merchants to adopt Bitcoin as a payment method today. Without 0-conf, you can forget about Bitcoin adoption for payments getting any traction whatsoever.\r\n\r\nAccepting payments with 0-conf works ok today. It's not perfect, but it works. We do acknowledge that as block rewards go to zero, there will be more incentives for miners to implement some sort of RBF. But this will take years before that happens naturally. When it does happen, there will likely be alternative better 0-conf solutions that merchants and payment processors can switch to. There is __absolutely__ no reason to speed that up. Seems silly that anyone would risk hurting the nascent Bitcoin payment system just to prove a point.",

Probably FS should be also maintained as an option.\r\n\r\nAnd again, big NACK on deployment schedules for policy code, either it becomes part of the standard policy or becomes an alternative policy (although those would require something like #6068 to get started, a factory like in #5180, and then more changes to generically encapsulate the mempool replacement).\r\nWithout making any moral judgement, maintaining and releasing versions with alternative policies yourself seems contradictory with proposing stricter than necessary restrictions to the use of the policy options when it comes to bitcoin/master.\r\n",

We could first support it optionally and then make it the default. At the same time we can support other replacement policies like rbf, cpfp, etc. cleanly and without risk (because it's just well encapsulated code disabled by default). ",
