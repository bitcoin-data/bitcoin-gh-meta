I'd personally be fine with applying an uniform rule as it's more clear. Though one could counter-argue that there are some modules from where in almost all cases we only import one symbol, and it's probably not worth it to add two extra lines, e.g. the following, being present in every single functional test:\r\n```from test_framework.test_framework import BitcoinTestFramework```\r\n\r\nAnyways, if you (or anyone else) plans a follow-up, feel free to tag me as reviewer.",
