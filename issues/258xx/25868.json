From \\\\IP.Ad.re.ss\\release\\Folder\\bitcoin-qt.exe i have a shortcut on my Desktop to start it and in registry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Bitcoin\\Bitcoin-Qt\\strDataDir is  \\\\IP.Ad.re.ss\\release\\Folder. This has worked well for several years. The last working version for me was bitcoin-0.21.1-win64. I have now updated to version bitcoin-23.0-win64. \r\nAt startup, the error comes from the title. After copying back version bitcoin-0.21.1-win64 it works again immediately.\r\nI use Windows 11 22H2 - including all updates with Core I3 8100T and 10GB RAM.\r\n\r\nthe release is on a QNAP. The release itself works because the bitcoin-qt.exe is also started by the same.\r\nI am using bitcoin-core from bitcoin-23.0-win64.zip website\r\n\r\ndebug.log writes nothing to its error - only the dialog box on start bitcoin-qt in version 23.0 win64\r\n\r\nMany Thanks for fixing it.\r\ncard0384\r\n",
