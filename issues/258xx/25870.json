   "body" : "As per https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25560, I suggested that new maintainers should be added with a call for maintainer process as outlined below.\r\n\r\n> \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)  by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\r\n if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\r\n role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\r\n maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\r\n relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\r\n\r\nThe doc has not been adopted. However, bitcoin is a permissionless project, so I am opening a C4M that is just of my own personal initiative.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Do we need a new scoped maintainer?\r\n\r\nFrom IRC on August 12th, 2022, where @laanwj also stepped down:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<bytes1440000> I see a need for \"janitorial maintainer\" who understands the importance of privacy in core and privacy of contributors. Since #25560 is still open and intent of reviewers doesn't look they want to improve anything in the process, there is no \"call for maintainers\" thing.\r\n<bytes1440000> I would prefer someone who has already contributed to bitcoin privacy and privacy in general, not living in first world countries and not funded by brink.\r\n<vasild> #proposedmeetingtopic vasild for a new maintainer with a focus on P2P/networking \r\n<vasild> I volunteer, if there is a perceived need for that.\r\n<bytes1440000> vasild: thanks for volunteering and i think you are the best candidate for p2p/privacy. I wish we had one for mempool/privacy and wallet/privacy as well.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Today's IRC Meeting, August 18th 2022. For the sake of the new process, please consider that ACKs here are ACKs on the person but are included here as demonstrating ACKs on the need for such a new maintainer & the role. Note also that vasild is not explicitly stating privacy, as bytes1440000 requested initially, which has been clarified below in this discussion to be out-of-scope for this proposed maintainer. (Please see the complete logs for all discussion, this is not a full excerpy).\r\n\r\n```\r\n<vasild_> Two maintainers stepped down recently (sipa and laanwj) and there is no dedicated maintainer for P2P/networking. So I step in coz I think I can help the project in that way. That's it.\r\n<laanwj> i think it would make some sense, you've been the most active in P2P development for quite a while\r\n<jarolrod> concept ack, i think vasild_ is very qualified for such a role. And has contributed important changes to the p2p code. He also has done extensive reviews, and catching issues others don't catch\r\n<michaelfolkson> +1\r\n<hebasto> concept ack\r\n<achow101> ack\r\n<lightlike> ack vasild\r\n<jonatack> a thought: the past few years vasild, laanwj, and myself have been working on or reviewing a large-ish chunk of net code that few others have been. i believe sipa knows the code well, too, along with (maybe) a couple others. laanwj has been merging these changes. so it makes sense to me that one of these would maintain.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Relevant Evamples of PRs such a maintainer might focus on\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25421\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25717\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25688\r\n\r\nwhich includes things that impact privacy in P2P\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19860\r\n\r\nBut does not include non P2P/Networking Privacy code like:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23372\r\n\r\n## Nominees\r\n\r\nI will keep this synced with nominees from the below thread / other maintainers feel free to edit to keep synchronized.  Feel free to self nominate. As per #25560, nomination period + Q&A is \"open\" for 2 weeks, after which a decision may be made if desired.\r\n\r\nCurrent Nominees:\r\n\r\n- @vasild (nomination accepted, self)\r\n- @jonatack (nomination acceptance pending)",
