I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\r\nI downloaded the x86 linux binaries for bitcoin v23.0 from [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-23.0/) and I wasn't able to use the wallet descriptors because it was not compiled with sqlite support. These changes broke my test environment because I was fetching the binary to create a docker image for regtest.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\nCompile the binaries with sqlite support by default, or have to versions for each release.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\nThe fix was easy, compile from source with sqlite support so I have the right binaries for my docker image but I am not sure why it is not done in this way for the release binaries.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nMaybe there is a good reason for not compiling it directly with sqlite, so if I am missing something just let me know\r\n",
