It is literally just burning money. While there are some applications where burning money is the point, I don't think we should really be encouraging/enabling those. Just because someone uses a particular feature does not mean it is necessarily good or worth keeping. Furthermore, I would not be surprised if many of those applications are burning money accidentally. A few developers I have spoken to were surprised that 0 value op_returns were allowed because they were not aware of the exception to the dust limit for op_returns. Application developers may have the same misconception.\r\n\r\n> wouldn't it make more sense to just have an option to prune this before saving it to disk?\r\n\r\nDisk space is not the concern. Whether the amount is 0 or something else doesn't matter, it still takes up the same amount of space. We're already pruning op_returns from the UTXO set. Rather the point is to add a protection for users. The purpose is to prevent users from accidentally burning money. In general, we should erect barriers to users throwing away their money as it is often done by accident.",
