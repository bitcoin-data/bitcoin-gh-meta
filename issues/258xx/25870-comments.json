What should the general goals of Bitcoin Core (not Bitcoin) with respect to P2P & Networking?\r\n\r\nI ask because as per bitcoincore.org, \r\n\r\n> Project maintainers have commit access and are responsible for merging patches from contributors. They perform a janitorial role merging patches that the team agrees should be merged. They also act as a final check to ensure that patches are safe and in line with the project goals. The maintainersâ role is by agreement of project contributors.\r\n\r\nSo I think it is interesting to know what you think the project goals should be in this regard.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJeremy",

It would be good to spec out what exactly such a role would entail as a maintainer given that it is not a module-defined topic. Where I disagree with @achow101 is that I think it would be very good to have a privacy maintainer, because it would be great to ensure that when we merge any PRs that have a privacy impact, we have someone who is well versed in how to analyze privacy & the goals of the project w.r.t. privacy checking it over. @1440000bytes as a concrete next step maybe you can lead a separate discussion and build out more merit for the idea of having a privacy maintainer and what/how they might do that role, and open a C4M when it seems more fleshed out?",
