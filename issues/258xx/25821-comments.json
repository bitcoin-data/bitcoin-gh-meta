The [`zh_CN` team](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin/teams/159/zh_CN/) has 197 translators, and [seone](https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/seone/) as a coordinator who has not been active for years. Why not nominate a new person or a few people for coordinator role on the IRC chat?\r\n\r\nFWIW, after the issue with Ukrainian translation, I've volunteered for a coordinator role in the Ukrainian team.
