   "body" : "While BIP-341 calls the contents of tapleaf a \"script\", only in the case that the tapleaf version is `0xc0` is this script known to be a tapscript.  Otherwise the tapleaf \"script\" is simply an uninterpreted string of bytes.\r\n\r\nThis PR corrects the issue where the type `CScript` is used prior to the tapleaf version being known to be a tapscript.  This prevents `CScript` methods from erroneously being called on non-tapscript data.\r\n\r\nA second commit abstracts out the TapBranch hash computation in the same manner that the TapLeaf computation is already abstracted.  These two abstractions ensure that the TapLeaf and TapBranch tagged hashes are always constructed properly.",
