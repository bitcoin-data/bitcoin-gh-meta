View details and see that the Last Receive time is counting upward.\n4) Plug back in the router, peers disappear from list as soon as network connectivity is reestablished.\n\nPeers appearing connected with a low ping time, even though nothing is being received, is misleading to the user. This was tested on linux.\n",
