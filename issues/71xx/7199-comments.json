I'm speaking explicitly on the log events for what the node does because it was commanded to do so via a JSON-RPC connection, and not through its normal course of operating. This request already assumes a properly functioning core node that is behaving as expected if left alone. It is entirely for investigating just what happens when a user-made application interacts with the core node.\n\nBasically, if the node does \"something\" because an RPC command told it to do so, I'd like those events (whatever they may be, ideally as verbose as possible) in a separate log file.  \n\nSometimes, when using RPC commands very frequently, there may be a timeout or error on a call that is not easy to reproduce, and any extra information/help when diagnosing these issues will help immensely...\n",

This wouldn't explicitly associate the low level logging with the rpc call, but it should be a decent approximation and the log file would grow more slowly as it would only be logging during the life of the rpc call.\n\nI looked into it and making it thread-specific would, I think, require a pretty ugly hack to LogAcceptCategory.  But logging all threads for that short little period of time would be easy with an extra flag, \"fDebugAllTemporarily\". \n\nIf that sounds useful, let me know and I'll submit a pull. \n",
