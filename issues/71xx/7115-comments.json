      "body" : "NACK for now.\n\n@sipa Why does this circular dependency have to be solved right now?\n\nI'm all for cleaning up the code design, but I think the proper next step is to make the mempool unaware of the policy estimator not the other way around.   I think it would make sense for the mempool to be aware of it's current state, so when TrimToSize is called with an argument, the mempool should remember what size it has now been trimmed to, thus GetMinFee would no longer need an argument.  I think thats cleaner and makes more sense than having two TrimToSize functions just for testing purposes as in this pull.  I'm happy to do that as soon as I'm in front of a computer again.\n\nMore importantly, the bigger problem with this pull is it has now put logic inside of the CTxMemPool::estimate functions which were previously just dumb pass throughs.  When those functions go away (because the block policy estimator is used directly), then that logic will have to be repeated at all calling sites.  I don't see why calling code should need to understand that you have to ask the mempool for its min fee in order to call estimate fee.  I think all the logic thats required to do smart fee estimation should be contained in one place, and the policy estimator makes sense to me as that place.\n\nEven further, future developments in the policy estimator are surely going to require it to be aware of the mempool, I just don't see a way around that.  The most obvious next direct step is to asses how much current back log there is in the mempool and make sure a fee is not returned which is lower than could be reached in the target number of blocks.\n\nThese concerns have been raised with @jtimon previously, and it would been nice if this pull would have referenced them.\n",

You don't have to chose one or the other, they can be completely independent.\n\n> I think it would make sense for the mempool to be aware of it's current state, so when TrimToSize is called with an argument, the mempool should remember what size it has now been trimmed to, thus GetMinFee would no longer need an argument\n\nI highly dislike that \"solution\" (what is this solving exactly?), the default if not provided being \"the same that was used in the last call\" is a twisted interface.\n\n> More importantly, the bigger problem with this pull is it has now put logic inside of the CTxMemPool::estimate functions which were previously just dumb pass throughs. When those functions go away (because the block policy estimator is used directly), then that logic will have to be repeated at all calling sites\n\nIt is really dumb logic, but as you say that can be solved when those functions go away. For example, if GetMinFee() was part of the estimator rather than the mempool, it could be called internally CBlockPolicyEstimator::estimateSmartFee()\n\n> I don't see why calling code should need to understand that you have to ask the mempool for its min fee in order to call estimate fee. I think all the logic thats required to do smart fee estimation should be contained in one place, and the policy estimator makes sense to me as that place.\n\nAgreed, but this has nothing to do with CBlockPolicyEstimator depending on CTxMemPool.\n\n> Even further, future developments in the policy estimator are surely going to require it to be aware of the mempool, I just don't see a way around that. \n\nI've done it once, I will do it again, and I'm convinced it is completely possible to make the mempool and the policy fully independent no matter the functionality.\nIf you are skeptic, that's fine. But please don't put obstacles in the way just because you don't think is possible. I'll gladly rewrite all that whenever \"is time\" for #6068 and friends again (a signal I'm waiting to hear from @sipa, btw, since he insisted that policy encapsulation would get in the way of mempool work).\n\n> These concerns have been raised with @jtimon previously, and it would been nice if this pull would have referenced them.\n\nI very explicitly and repeatedly referenced #6134 where those discussions where happening.\nBut for better reference: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6134#discussion_r45216058 \nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6134#issuecomment-159282982\n",

It's used only for GetMinFee which only cares about how much the mempool has shrunk since the last time you trimmed it.  If we ever changed to some algorithm with dynamic mempool sizes and we had an attribute for the new mempool size, we would also need a separate variable tracking the last size we were trimmed to.  Would be nice if that variable were perhaps limited to the GetMinFee code itself I suppose. \n",

This preserves a bit more flexibility for how we do mempool trimming in the future, but both my approach and Jorge's approach just eliminate repeated calls to `GetArg(\"-maxmempool\")`.  They don't solve the circular dependency.\n\n2) Jorge and I both agree that CTxMemPool should not depend on the policy estimation code.  This is a larger change not addressed in this pull.  The other half of the circular dependency is where we disagree in that I actually think the policy estimation code should depend on the mempool.  I don't particularly understand why its bad to temporarily have introduced this circular dependency if the side that was recently added is the side that we think will persist.  But if everyone feels it has to be removed immediately, then the solution Jorge has for that in this pull (putting a tiny bit of the logic in the pass-through estimation functions) is probably as good as it gets.  When we eliminate the other side of the dependency, then we can figure out how to fix that up. \n",

I could have left the `GetArg(\"-maxmempool\", DEFAULT_MAX_MEMPOOL_SIZE) * 1000000` all around, but I had already grep that...\nI think we can all agree that doing it in init like most command line options is a reasonable and simple refactor.\nIt seems we disagree on whether this is passed too much as a parameter or it should be part of CTxMemPool or CBlockPolicyEstimator or CDefaultPolicy.\nI think going from mapArgs to its own independent global is clearly a step forward. \nBut if people disagree, I can easily write a third patch that removes the circular dependency while maintaining all the `GetArg(\"-maxmempool\", DEFAULT_MAX_MEMPOOL_SIZE) * 1000000` verbosity.\n\n> 2) Jorge and I both agree that CTxMemPool should not depend on the policy estimation code.\n\nYes, but it seems that your plan to do so is by making CBlockPolicyEstimator (and policy/policy.o?) dependent on CTxMemPool instead. This is not necessary.\nAnd moving in that direction at the cost of creating a new circular dependency was clearly not necessary in #6134, and that's all what this PR is about.\n\nWe can discuss the future of relay/fee/mining policy code encapsulation. Although I won't be able to rebase/rewrite a branch completely decoupling CBlockPolicyEstimator and CTxMemPool anytime before 0.12 relase, but I assure you that you can always place the code wherever you want without affecting what the code itself does. In the meantime I'm happy to review any fee estimation/policy encapsulation specific PR you may have (but I warn you, I will always be adverse to gratuitously make CBlockPolicyEstimator dependend on CTxMemPool, and I firmly believe I can always proof that it is being done \"gratuitously\", just by providing a similar alternative that doesn't, like I did in #6134).\nPolicy and fee encapsulation is something of interest for both of us and that's great.\nFinding out where we agree and disagree is, I believe, in our mutual interest.\nBut please let's find a solution for this PR first.\n",
