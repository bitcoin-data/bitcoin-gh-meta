This is roughly the same usage pattern I saw which led me to try and limit I2P traffic only to bitcoin peers initially -- in fact a few months ago when monitoring for longer periods, I found I2P using more than double the bitcoind totals.\r\n\r\nI accept (and agree!) that we should want to and encourage contributing back to the wider I2P network for it's network health and, for me personally it's no issue, as I'm on an unmetered connection. But I still wonder whether a comment around \"expected\" I2P bandwidth usage might be warranted in a future PR to give a heads up to entities with limited resources?",
