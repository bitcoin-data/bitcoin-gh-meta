   "body" : "Mocking `CMainSignals` gives us the ability to control when the `CValidationInterface` callbacks are called on `PeerManager` in the `process_message(s)` targets. It thereby makes these targets more deterministic/reproducable and slightly faster (per eyeball measurements 5%-10% more execs/s on my machine).\r\n\r\nMostly looking for conceptual review on this because there is an argument to be made about fuzzing with the real `CMainSignals` in combination with TSan, so maybe preserving that behavior in another target could also make sense.",
