   "body" : "Over the past couple of years, I have noticed a pattern of behavior from some who participate in Bitcoin Core's development that is abusive and disruptive. These people have made it increasingly difficult to work on this project and generally produced a more toxic working environment. I have heard complaints about specific individuals in the past, but no action was taken nor were there any guidelines on how to deal with such individuals. By introducing a Code of Conduct, we can set the expectations for behavior (it's surprising that adults need to be told how to behave) as well as guidelines for enforcing and punishing those who violate those guidelines.\r\n\r\nThis code of conduct comes from version 2.1 of the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).\r\n\r\nCurrently the Code of Conduct has people report to a conduct@bitcoincore.org email address. This will need to be setup to forward emails to those who will deal with conduct violations. However we should also have those people be listed by name and email in the document as well so that they can be reached individually. I suggest that we have all of the current maintainers be able to receive reports of conduct violations as well as laanwj and sipa. Additionally, in order to properly handle violations, I propose that these people have at least the Moderator permissions (note that maintainers have the Write permission, which afaict, does not allow blocking of users) and Operator permissions on the `#bitcoin-core-dev` IRC channel.\r\n\r\nAs some aspects of dealing with code of conduct violations involves public posts, I would also suggest that we enable and use the Discussions feature for that purpose so we can keep them separate from normal issues.",
