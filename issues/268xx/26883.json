   "body" : "Two follow-ups for #26695, both refactoring and no observed (*) behaviour change:\r\n- Rename `gArgs` to `args` because it's not actually a global\r\n- Add `BlockAssembler::Options` as a (private) member to `BlockAssembler` to avoid having to assign all the options individually, essentially duplicating them\r\n\r\nReduces LoC and makes the code more readable, in my opinion. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n(*) as [pointed out by ajtowns](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26883#discussion_r1068247937), this PR changes the interface of `ApplyArgsManOptions()`, making this not a pure refactoring PR. In practice, `ApplyArgsManOptions()` is never called in such a way that this leads to observed behaviour change. Regardless, I've carved out the potential behaviour change into a separate commit and would be okay with dropping it, should it turn out to be controversial.",
