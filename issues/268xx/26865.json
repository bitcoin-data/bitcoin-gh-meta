It can provide PR diff analysis.\r\nThe code in this PR doesn't currently work because it requires a Sonarcloud account along with a token.\r\n\r\nI've tested it on master and some pull requests if you want to take a look: https://sonarcloud.io/summary/overall?id=aureleoules_bitcoin.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts!\r\n",
