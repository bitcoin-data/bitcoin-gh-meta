   "body" : "This is a draft for a consensus change enabling on-chain vaults, as detailed in this paper (https://jameso.be/vaults.pdf).\r\n\r\nIn short, it introduces two opcodes, `OP_VAULT` and `OP_UNVAULT`, that facilitate constructing vaults which\r\n\r\n- allow multiple deposits,\r\n- allow partial unvaultings and recursive re-vaults,\r\n- allow batch operations (recoveries and unvaultings) using vaults with compatible parameters,\r\n- support dynamic withdrawal target specification, and\r\n- support robust fee management.\r\n\r\nFor the last item, the proposal has a hard dependency on package relay and ephemeral anchors.\r\n\r\nThe code as-written here lacks specific activation mechanism, and there's probably some policy/wallet stuff missing,\r\n but in substance it is implemented and comes with some interesting functional tests.\r\n",
