I also couldn't find any accompanying tests for this which would also be helpful.\r\n\r\nAs for your comment, I wasn't sure if this was a potential issue or not so I started here.  The `#bitcoin-core-pr-reviews` seems more geared toward reviewing active or recent PR's, right?  Wouldn't `#bitcoin-core-dev` be more appropriate?  I didn't want to be intrusive so I'll also consider Bitcoin Stack Exchange in the future.",
