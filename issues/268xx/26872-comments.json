The `SyncWithValidationInterfaceQueue` does slow down the targets, so it's a little annoying to have that when it's practically never needed.\r\n\r\nI have been working on targets that more specifically fuzz certain protocol flows (e.g. the version handshake, block/tx relay). These targets mostly submit valid headers/blocks/txs to net_processing, so I guess what I am suggesting here makes more sense for them.",
