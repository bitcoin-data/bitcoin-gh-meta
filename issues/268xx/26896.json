   "body" : "This PR removes the `--enable-upnp-default` and `--enable-natpmp-default` options from configure.\r\n\r\nIt's odd to me that we maintain configure-time options for setting the default port-forwarding runtime state (but no other similar options), and I'm not sure what use-case it satisfies, that can't be achieved by multiple other means. I also doubt that we'll ever restart using these in release builds, or turning on any of this by default.\r\n\r\nI think the only scenario these options would be used is when you want to compile your own binaries (we don't use them in Guix), with port-forwarding on by default, but otherwise can't or don't want to use a `.conf` file, can't or don't want to pass command line options at runtime, and also don't want to modify the source code?",
