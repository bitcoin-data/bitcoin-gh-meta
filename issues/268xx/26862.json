   "body" : "The problem is caused by the inability to run multiple nodes on the same PC due to a conflict in the listening port for Tor connections.\r\n\r\nHere also people faced a similar problem:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/22668\r\n\r\nMy idea is to prevent the array of ports for the onion process from filling up before running ConnMan - thus, the listenonion=0 option will not only prevent the Tor service from starting, but will also not occupy the port.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I added port initialization for onion to keep the ability to run multiple nodes with Tor functionality.",
