This means we never used the generated address (destination), whose creation is not cheap. This does not mean that we will use the same address for more than one peer.\r\n* Lower the number of tunnels for transient sessions.\r\n* Explicitly specify the number of tunnels for persistent sessions instead of relying on the defaults which differ between I2P routers. This way we get consistent behavior with all routers.\r\n\r\nAlleviates: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26754\r\n\r\n(I have not tested this with i2pd, yet)",
