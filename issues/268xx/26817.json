   "body" : "The copyright years have many issues:\r\n\r\n* They may be wrong. For example, this can happen when code is moved from one file to a different one without taking over the copyright years. Or it may happen when the wrong years are inserted by a script or developer.\r\n* They are redundant. `git` already tracks the author date for every line of code in every commit.\r\n* They are not needed to establish \"copyright\", see https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/copyright-notices-in-open-source-software-projects/. Also, anyone who needs them for legal reasons would need to discover the ground truth themselves anyway. For example, with `git blame`, or `git log ...`, or by other means.\r\n* They cause pointless churn. See for example commit 306ccd4927a2efe325c8d84be1bdb79edeb29b04.\r\n* Many modern open source software projects never added them in the first place, or already removed them, see section below.\r\n\r\nFix all issues by removing them.\r\n\r\nThe `_COPYRIGHT_YEAR` build constant is kept, and still expected to be bumped every year, see for example commit 06dd571534c8ecdf7ade77546fcf3a56b3651f68. In theory it could be removed as well, but this change would cause user-visible changes, so discussion should be done in a separate thread.\r\n\r\nExamples of removed years in other projects:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/b87aabdfe1b7461e7331abb3601d9e6bb27544bc\r\n* https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/2bc1d775f510196154283374284f98d3eae03544",
