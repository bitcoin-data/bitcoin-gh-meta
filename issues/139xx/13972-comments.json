But this is more of a bitcoin-dev mailinglist thing.\r\n\r\nTo answer my own question from two years ago:\r\n > @TheBlueMatt does BIP-320 assign the same version bits as your [BetterHash draft BIP](https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bips/blob/betterhash/bip-XXXX.mediawiki)? If so, maybe that's useful to point out in BIP-320 and/or vice versa.\r\n\r\nBIP-310 describes a negotiation process where the miner indicates which bits it can roll, how many bits it wants to roll, and then the pool answers which bits it permits (taking into account ongoing softfork signalling and such).\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://braiins.com/stratum-v2#native",
