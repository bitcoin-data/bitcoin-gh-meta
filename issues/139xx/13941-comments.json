Examples include hardware wallets, multisig setups, and\n+[CoinJoin](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=279249) transactions.\n+\n+### Overall workflow\n+\n+Overall, the construction of a fully signed Bitcoin transaction goes through the\n+following steps:\n+\n+- A **Creator** proposes a particular transaction to be created. He constructs\n+  a PSBT that contains certain inputs and outputs, but no additional metadata.\n+- For each input, an **Updater** adds information about the UTXOs being spent by\n+  the transaction to the PSBT.\n+- A potentially other Updater adds information about the scripts and public keys\n+  involved in each of the inputs (and possibly outputs) of the PSBT.\n+- **Signers** inspect the transaction and its metadata to decide whether they\n+  agree with the transaction. They can use amount information from the UTXOs\n+  to assess the values and fees involved. If they agree, they produce a\n+  partial signature for the inputs for which they have relevant key(s).\n+- A **Finalizer** is run for each input to convert the partial signatures and\n+  possibly script information into a final `scriptSig` and/or `scriptWitness`.\n+- An **Extractor** produces a valid Bitcoin transaction (in network format)\n+  from a PSBT for which all inputs are finalized.\n+\n+Generally, each of the above (excluding Creator and Extractor) will simply\n+add more and more data to a particular PSBT. In a naive workflow, they all have\n+to operate sequentially, passing the PSBT from one to the next, until the\n+Extractor can convert it to a real transaction. In order to permit parallel\n+operation, **Combiners** can be employed which merge metadata from different\n+PSBTs for the same unsigned transaction.\n+\n+The names above in bold are the names of the roles defined in BIP174. They're\n+useful in understanding the underlying steps, but in practice, software and\n+hardware implementations will typically implement multiple roles simultaneously.\n+\n+## PSBT in Bitcoin Core\n+\n+### RPCs\n+\n+- **`converttopsbt` (Creator)** is a utility RPC that converts an\n+  unsigned raw transaction to PSBT format. It ignores existing signatures.\n+- **`createpsbt` (Creator)** is a utility RPC that takes a list of inputs and\n+  outputs and converts them to a PSBT with no additional information. It is\n+  equivalent to calling `createrawtransaction` followed by `converttopsbt`.\n+- **`walletcreatefundedpsbt` (Creator, Updater)** is a wallet RPC that creates a\n+  PSBT with the specified inputs and outputs, adds additional inputs and change\n+  to it to balance it out, and adds relevant metadata. In particular, for inputs\n+  that the wallet knows about (counting towards its normal or watch-only\n+  balance), UTXO information will be added. For outputs and inputs with UTXO\n+  information present, key and script information will be added which the wallet\n+  knows about. It is equivalent to running `createrawtransaction`, followed by\n+  `fundrawtransaction`, and `converttopsbt`.\n+- **`walletprocesspsbt` (Updater, Signer, Finalizer)** is a wallet RPC that takes as\n+  input a PSBT, adds UTXO, key, and script data to inputs and outputs that miss\n+  it, and optionally signs inputs. Where possible it also finalizes the partial\n+  signatures.\n+- **`finalizepsbt` (Finalizer, Extractor)** is a utility RPC that finalizes any\n+  partial signatures, and if all inputs are finalized, converts the result to a\n+  fully signed transaction which can be broadcast with `sendrawtransaction`.\n+- **`combinepsbt` (Combiner)** is a utility RPC that implements a Combiner. It\n+  can be used at any point in the workflow to merge information added to\n+  different versions of the same PSBT. In particular it is useful to combine the\n+  output of multiple Updaters or Signers.\n+- **`decodepsbt`** is a diagnostic utility RPC which will show all information in\n+  a PSBT in human-readable form, as well as compute its eventual fee if known.\n+\n+### Workflows\n+\n+#### Multisig with multiple Bitcoin Core instances\n+\n+Alice, Bob, and Carol want to create a 2-of-3 multisig address. They're all using\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+Setup:\n+- All three call `getnewaddress` to create a new address; call these addresses\n+  *Aalice*, *Abob*, and *Acarol*.\n+- All three call `getaddressinfo X`, with *X* their respective address, and\n+  remember the corresponding public keys. Call these public keys *Kalice*,\n+  *Kbob*, and *Kcarol*.\n+- All three now run `addmultisigaddress 2 [\"Kalice\",\"Kbob\",\"Kcarol\"]` to teach\n+  their wallet about the multisig script. Call the address produced by this\n+  command *Amulti*.\n+- They also run `importaddress \"Amulti\" \"\" false` to make their wallets treat\n+  payments to *Amulti* as contributing to the watch-only balance.\n+- Others can verify the produced address by running\n+  `createmultisig 2 [\"Kalice\",\"Kbob\",\"Kcarol\"]`, and expecting *Amulti* as\n+  output. This command won't enable them to initiate transactions later,\n+  however.\n+- They can now give out *D* as address others can pay to.\n+\n+Later, when *V* BTC has been received on *Amulti*, and Bob and Carol want to\n+move the coins in their entirety to address *Asend*, with no change. Alice\n+does not need to be involved.\n+- One of them - let's assume Carol here - initiates the creation. She runs\n+  `walletcreatefundedpsbt [] {\"Asend\":V} 0 false {\"subtractFeeFromOutputs\":[0]}`,",

Examples include hardware wallets, multisig setups, and\n+[CoinJoin](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=279249) transactions.\n+\n+### Overall workflow\n+\n+Overall, the construction of a fully signed Bitcoin transaction goes through the\n+following steps:\n+\n+- A **Creator** proposes a particular transaction to be created. He constructs\n+  a PSBT that contains certain inputs and outputs, but no additional metadata.\n+- For each input, an **Updater** adds information about the UTXOs being spent by\n+  the transaction to the PSBT.\n+- A potentially other Updater adds information about the scripts and public keys\n+  involved in each of the inputs (and possibly outputs) of the PSBT.\n+- **Signers** inspect the transaction and its metadata to decide whether they\n+  agree with the transaction. They can use amount information from the UTXOs\n+  to assess the values and fees involved. If they agree, they produce a\n+  partial signature for the inputs for which they have relevant key(s).\n+- A **Finalizer** is run for each input to convert the partial signatures and\n+  possibly script information into a final `scriptSig` and/or `scriptWitness`.\n+- An **Extractor** produces a valid Bitcoin transaction (in network format)\n+  from a PSBT for which all inputs are finalized.\n+\n+Generally, each of the above (excluding Creator and Extractor) will simply\n+add more and more data to a particular PSBT. In a naive workflow, they all have\n+to operate sequentially, passing the PSBT from one to the next, until the\n+Extractor can convert it to a real transaction. In order to permit parallel\n+operation, **Combiners** can be employed which merge metadata from different\n+PSBTs for the same unsigned transaction.\n+\n+The names above in bold are the names of the roles defined in BIP174. They're\n+useful in understanding the underlying steps, but in practice, software and\n+hardware implementations will typically implement multiple roles simultaneously.\n+\n+## PSBT in Bitcoin Core\n+\n+### RPCs\n+\n+- **`converttopsbt` (Creator)** is a utility RPC that converts an\n+  unsigned raw transaction to PSBT format. It ignores existing signatures.\n+- **`createpsbt` (Creator)** is a utility RPC that takes a list of inputs and\n+  outputs and converts them to a PSBT with no additional information. It is\n+  equivalent to calling `createrawtransaction` followed by `converttopsbt`.\n+- **`walletcreatefundedpsbt` (Creator, Updater)** is a wallet RPC that creates a\n+  PSBT with the specified inputs and outputs, adds additional inputs and change\n+  to it to balance it out, and adds relevant metadata. In particular, for inputs\n+  that the wallet knows about (counting towards its normal or watch-only\n+  balance), UTXO information will be added. For outputs and inputs with UTXO\n+  information present, key and script information will be added which the wallet\n+  knows about. It is equivalent to running `createrawtransaction`, followed by\n+  `fundrawtransaction`, and `converttopsbt`.\n+- **`walletprocesspsbt` (Updater, Signer, Finalizer)** is a wallet RPC that takes as\n+  input a PSBT, adds UTXO, key, and script data to inputs and outputs that miss\n+  it, and optionally signs inputs. Where possible it also finalizes the partial\n+  signatures.\n+- **`finalizepsbt` (Finalizer, Extractor)** is a utility RPC that finalizes any\n+  partial signatures, and if all inputs are finalized, converts the result to a\n+  fully signed transaction which can be broadcast with `sendrawtransaction`.\n+- **`combinepsbt` (Combiner)** is a utility RPC that implements a Combiner. It\n+  can be used at any point in the workflow to merge information added to\n+  different versions of the same PSBT. In particular it is useful to combine the\n+  output of multiple Updaters or Signers.\n+- **`decodepsbt`** is a diagnostic utility RPC which will show all information in\n+  a PSBT in human-readable form, as well as compute its eventual fee if known.\n+\n+### Workflows\n+\n+#### Multisig with multiple Bitcoin Core instances\n+\n+Alice, Bob, and Carol want to create a 2-of-3 multisig address. They're all using\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+Setup:\n+- All three call `getnewaddress` to create a new address; call these addresses\n+  *Aalice*, *Abob*, and *Acarol*.",

He constructs\n+  a PSBT that contains certain inputs and outputs, but no additional metadata.\n+- For each input, an **Updater** adds information about the UTXOs being spent by\n+  the transaction to the PSBT.\n+- A potentially other Updater adds information about the scripts and public keys\n+  involved in each of the inputs (and possibly outputs) of the PSBT.\n+- **Signers** inspect the transaction and its metadata to decide whether they\n+  agree with the transaction. They can use amount information from the UTXOs\n+  to assess the values and fees involved. If they agree, they produce a\n+  partial signature for the inputs for which they have relevant key(s).\n+- A **Finalizer** is run for each input to convert the partial signatures and\n+  possibly script information into a final `scriptSig` and/or `scriptWitness`.\n+- An **Extractor** produces a valid Bitcoin transaction (in network format)\n+  from a PSBT for which all inputs are finalized.\n+\n+Generally, each of the above (excluding Creator and Extractor) will simply\n+add more and more data to a particular PSBT. In a naive workflow, they all have\n+to operate sequentially, passing the PSBT from one to the next, until the\n+Extractor can convert it to a real transaction. In order to permit parallel\n+operation, **Combiners** can be employed which merge metadata from different\n+PSBTs for the same unsigned transaction.\n+\n+The names above in bold are the names of the roles defined in BIP174. They're\n+useful in understanding the underlying steps, but in practice, software and\n+hardware implementations will typically implement multiple roles simultaneously.\n+\n+## PSBT in Bitcoin Core\n+\n+### RPCs\n+\n+- **`converttopsbt` (Creator)** is a utility RPC that converts an\n+  unsigned raw transaction to PSBT format. It ignores existing signatures.\n+- **`createpsbt` (Creator)** is a utility RPC that takes a list of inputs and\n+  outputs and converts them to a PSBT with no additional information. It is\n+  equivalent to calling `createrawtransaction` followed by `converttopsbt`.\n+- **`walletcreatefundedpsbt` (Creator, Updater)** is a wallet RPC that creates a\n+  PSBT with the specified inputs and outputs, adds additional inputs and change\n+  to it to balance it out, and adds relevant metadata. In particular, for inputs\n+  that the wallet knows about (counting towards its normal or watch-only\n+  balance), UTXO information will be added. For outputs and inputs with UTXO\n+  information present, key and script information will be added which the wallet\n+  knows about. It is equivalent to running `createrawtransaction`, followed by\n+  `fundrawtransaction`, and `converttopsbt`.\n+- **`walletprocesspsbt` (Updater, Signer, Finalizer)** is a wallet RPC that takes as\n+  input a PSBT, adds UTXO, key, and script data to inputs and outputs that miss\n+  it, and optionally signs inputs. Where possible it also finalizes the partial\n+  signatures.\n+- **`finalizepsbt` (Finalizer, Extractor)** is a utility RPC that finalizes any\n+  partial signatures, and if all inputs are finalized, converts the result to a\n+  fully signed transaction which can be broadcast with `sendrawtransaction`.\n+- **`combinepsbt` (Combiner)** is a utility RPC that implements a Combiner. It\n+  can be used at any point in the workflow to merge information added to\n+  different versions of the same PSBT. In particular it is useful to combine the\n+  output of multiple Updaters or Signers.\n+- **`decodepsbt`** is a diagnostic utility RPC which will show all information in\n+  a PSBT in human-readable form, as well as compute its eventual fee if known.\n+\n+### Workflows\n+\n+#### Multisig with multiple Bitcoin Core instances\n+\n+Alice, Bob, and Carol want to create a 2-of-3 multisig address. They're all using\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+Setup:\n+- All three call `getnewaddress` to create a new address; call these addresses\n+  *Aalice*, *Abob*, and *Acarol*.\n+- All three call `getaddressinfo X`, with *X* their respective address, and\n+  remember the corresponding public keys. Call these public keys *Kalice*,\n+  *Kbob*, and *Kcarol*.\n+- All three now run `addmultisigaddress 2 [\"Kalice\",\"Kbob\",\"Kcarol\"]` to teach\n+  their wallet about the multisig script. Call the address produced by this\n+  command *Amulti*.\n+- They also run `importaddress \"Amulti\" \"\" false` to make their wallets treat\n+  payments to *Amulti* as contributing to the watch-only balance.\n+- Others can verify the produced address by running\n+  `createmultisig 2 [\"Kalice\",\"Kbob\",\"Kcarol\"]`, and expecting *Amulti* as\n+  output. This command won't enable them to initiate transactions later,\n+  however.\n+- They can now give out *D* as address others can pay to.\n+\n+Later, when *V* BTC has been received on *Amulti*, and Bob and Carol want to\n+move the coins in their entirety to address *Asend*, with no change. Alice\n+does not need to be involved.\n+- One of them - let's assume Carol here - initiates the creation.

Examples include hardware wallets, multisig setups, and\n+[CoinJoin](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=279249) transactions.\n+\n+### Overall workflow\n+\n+Overall, the construction of a fully signed Bitcoin transaction goes through the\n+following steps:\n+\n+- A **Creator** proposes a particular transaction to be created. He constructs\n+  a PSBT that contains certain inputs and outputs, but no additional metadata.\n+- For each input, an **Updater** adds information about the UTXOs being spent by\n+  the transaction to the PSBT.\n+- A potentially other Updater adds information about the scripts and public keys\n+  involved in each of the inputs (and possibly outputs) of the PSBT.\n+- **Signers** inspect the transaction and its metadata to decide whether they\n+  agree with the transaction. They can use amount information from the UTXOs\n+  to assess the values and fees involved. If they agree, they produce a\n+  partial signature for the inputs for which they have relevant key(s).\n+- A **Finalizer** is run for each input to convert the partial signatures and\n+  possibly script information into a final `scriptSig` and/or `scriptWitness`.\n+- An **Extractor** produces a valid Bitcoin transaction (in network format)\n+  from a PSBT for which all inputs are finalized.\n+\n+Generally, each of the above (excluding Creator and Extractor) will simply\n+add more and more data to a particular PSBT. In a naive workflow, they all have\n+to operate sequentially, passing the PSBT from one to the next, until the\n+Extractor can convert it to a real transaction. In order to permit parallel\n+operation, **Combiners** can be employed which merge metadata from different\n+PSBTs for the same unsigned transaction.\n+\n+The names above in bold are the names of the roles defined in BIP174. They're\n+useful in understanding the underlying steps, but in practice, software and\n+hardware implementations will typically implement multiple roles simultaneously.\n+\n+## PSBT in Bitcoin Core\n+\n+### RPCs\n+\n+- **`converttopsbt` (Creator)** is a utility RPC that converts an\n+  unsigned raw transaction to PSBT format. It ignores existing signatures.\n+- **`createpsbt` (Creator)** is a utility RPC that takes a list of inputs and\n+  outputs and converts them to a PSBT with no additional information. It is\n+  equivalent to calling `createrawtransaction` followed by `converttopsbt`.\n+- **`walletcreatefundedpsbt` (Creator, Updater)** is a wallet RPC that creates a\n+  PSBT with the specified inputs and outputs, adds additional inputs and change\n+  to it to balance it out, and adds relevant metadata. In particular, for inputs\n+  that the wallet knows about (counting towards its normal or watch-only\n+  balance), UTXO information will be added. For outputs and inputs with UTXO\n+  information present, key and script information will be added which the wallet\n+  knows about. It is equivalent to running `createrawtransaction`, followed by\n+  `fundrawtransaction`, and `converttopsbt`.\n+- **`walletprocesspsbt` (Updater, Signer, Finalizer)** is a wallet RPC that takes as\n+  input a PSBT, adds UTXO, key, and script data to inputs and outputs that miss\n+  it, and optionally signs inputs. Where possible it also finalizes the partial\n+  signatures.\n+- **`finalizepsbt` (Finalizer, Extractor)** is a utility RPC that finalizes any\n+  partial signatures, and if all inputs are finalized, converts the result to a\n+  fully signed transaction which can be broadcast with `sendrawtransaction`.\n+- **`combinepsbt` (Combiner)** is a utility RPC that implements a Combiner. It\n+  can be used at any point in the workflow to merge information added to\n+  different versions of the same PSBT. In particular it is useful to combine the\n+  output of multiple Updaters or Signers.\n+- **`decodepsbt`** is a diagnostic utility RPC which will show all information in\n+  a PSBT in human-readable form, as well as compute its eventual fee if known.\n+\n+### Workflows\n+\n+#### Multisig with multiple Bitcoin Core instances\n+\n+Alice, Bob, and Carol want to create a 2-of-3 multisig address.

Where possible it also finalizes the partial\n+  signatures.\n+- **`finalizepsbt` (Finalizer, Extractor)** is a utility RPC that finalizes any\n+  partial signatures, and if all inputs are finalized, converts the result to a\n+  fully signed transaction which can be broadcast with `sendrawtransaction`.\n+- **`combinepsbt` (Combiner)** is a utility RPC that implements a Combiner. It\n+  can be used at any point in the workflow to merge information added to\n+  different versions of the same PSBT. In particular it is useful to combine the\n+  output of multiple Updaters or Signers.\n+- **`decodepsbt`** is a diagnostic utility RPC which will show all information in\n+  a PSBT in human-readable form, as well as compute its eventual fee if known.\n+\n+### Workflows\n+\n+#### Multisig with multiple Bitcoin Core instances\n+\n+Alice, Bob, and Carol want to create a 2-of-3 multisig address. They're all using\n+Bitcoin Core. We assume their wallets only contain the multisig funds. In case\n+they also have a personal wallet, this can be accomplished through the\n+multiwallet feature - possibly resulting in a need to add `-rpcwallet=name` to\n+the command line in case `bitcoin-cli` is used.\n+\n+Setup:\n+- All three call `getnewaddress` to create a new address; call these addresses\n+  *Aalice*, *Abob*, and *Acarol*.\n+- All three call `getaddressinfo X`, with *X* their respective address, and\n+  remember the corresponding public keys. Call these public keys *Kalice*,\n+  *Kbob*, and *Kcarol*.\n+- All three now run `addmultisigaddress 2 [\"Kalice\",\"Kbob\",\"Kcarol\"]` to teach\n+  their wallet about the multisig script. Call the address produced by this\n+  command *Amulti*. They may be required to explicitly specify the same\n+  addresstype option each, to avoid constructing different versions due to\n+  differences in configuration.\n+- They also run `importaddress \"Amulti\" \"\" false` to make their wallets treat\n+  payments to *Amulti* as contributing to the watch-only balance.\n+- Others can verify the produced address by running\n+  `createmultisig 2 [\"Kalice\",\"Kbob\",\"Kcarol\"]`, and expecting *Amulti* as\n+  output. Again, it may be necessary to explicitly specify the addresstype\n+  in order to get a result that matches. This command won't enable them to\n+  initiate transactions later, however.\n+- They can now give out *D* as address others can pay to.\n+\n+Later, when *V* BTC has been received on *Amulti*, and Bob and Carol want to\n+move the coins in their entirety to address *Asend*, with no change. Alice\n+does not need to be involved.\n+- One of them - let's assume Carol here - initiates the creation. She runs\n+  `walletcreatefundedpsbt [] {\"Asend\":V} 0 false {\"subtractFeeFromOutputs\":[0], \"includeWatching\":true}`.",
