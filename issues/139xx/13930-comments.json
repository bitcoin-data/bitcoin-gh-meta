Presumably they just remain `BLOCK_VALID_TREE`.\r\n\r\nThe only two other places where `BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD` is set are `LoadBlockIndex` (only called at launch) and `FindMostWorkChain`, which only traverses from the candidate block down to the bad block via `->pprev`.\r\n\r\nIf we learned about D3 after E1 was connected, it has less work than E1 - assuming equal difficulty - and therefore we would not have tried to connect it. Then when F2 comes in it does have more work, so now we try to connect it, which is when we find out C2 is invalid. So then we mark F2...C2 invalid, still ignoring D3. \r\n\r\nI think we should use the block height as the number in this chart, to emphasize relative difficulty",
