I am using bitcoin's earlier version so that to learn creating new coin. I'm using 0.8.7.4 and in that gitian-builder version there's a package requirement named - \"miniupnpc-1.9.20140401.tar.gz\" so I downloaded it from the official website and put it into gitian's inputs folder. then I run sudo bin/gbuild ../mycoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/deps-win32.yml and it fails and tells me \r\nminiupnpc-1.9.20140401.tar.gz: FAILED\r\nsha256sum: WARNING: 1 computed checksum did NOT match\r\n\r\nI am using the exact same version of miniupnpc as it asks me to use in depth-win32.yml. what is wrong? please guys help\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
