Instead of passing around `void*` for the ZMQ context and socket, you have a typed object (e.g. `zmq::socket_t`).  And instead of manually calling an initialiser and a destructor for it, this is done by the language - including a guarantee that the destructor is called, which might be forgotten when using the pure C API (especially with things like multiple returns in a function or exceptions).\r\n\r\nIf there is no longer a big reason not to depend on the C++ wrapper, then I can simply prepare a PR that changes to it and then we can judge based on that how much it simplifies the code (or not).",
