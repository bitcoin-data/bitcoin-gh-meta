   "body" : "I would like to suggest a simple idea to boost merchant adoption. \r\nBasically every merchant can already just accept Bitcoin, but they can't give out Bitcoin payment receipts yet. Customers would like to receive some form of physical proof of payment. \r\nNow I think the \"Request payment\" is a great feature for merchants. Label and Message can function as payment information, such as customercode and ordernumber etc.\r\n\r\nThe only thing missing in my opinion is the ability to print the \"Request payment to ...\" window. If we can print the information in this window, this can function as a decent store receipt.\r\nMaybe we should be adding more optional fields in the future, so that the company details can be at the bottom of the receipt. A simple variable input field that allows multiple lines for example.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about this idea?",
