In any other place we only select coins that aren't only watched but we can also sign for.\r\n\r\nFor P2PK/P2WPKH we can estimate the size even without being able to solve them. For others, I guess the only options are either refusing to select the coins, return an error, or give a default guess (say, assume every P2SH is P2WSH/3-of-3-multisig or so).\r\n\r\nIt could also be an option to `fundrawtransaction` to enable selection of unsolvable coins, defaulting to off.",
