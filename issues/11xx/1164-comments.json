The solution I propose is that this can be (and should be) fixed during the -rescan operation, whereby the balance should be corrected based upon the transaction history for the addresses in the wallet. Also, as a matter of course, whenever a transaction is found to be invalid (due to the inputs having already been used), it should be shown as invalid, rather than remain \"unconfirmed\", IMHO.\n",
