There is no need to update the UI faster than say, 10 times per second, even if hundreds of blocks come in. The timer, combined with a flag maybe wasn't that bad an idea after all.\n- And it would be useful to make notifications more specific. Different notifications from the core whether the balance could have changed, or the number of blocks, or the number of connections... instead of a generic call.
