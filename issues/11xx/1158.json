   "body" : "It was suggested to raise this issue by @laanwj due to it being an orthogonal issue. Not so much an \"issue\" but a feature suggestion/request. This would be useful for changing the configuration but without experiencing too much downtime, testing, etc.\n\nA standard used by many programs would be to make the software re-parse the config file upon receiving a HUP signal. This would work on unix systems, but on Windows, some other standard is presumably available to triggering this.\n",
