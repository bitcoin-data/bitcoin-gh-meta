The issue was that nodes were being disconnected when they were simply doing as they were told - but what is the alternative to this? How do we avoid receiving duplicate blocks? The only way I see this is to NEVER request the same block from another node unless the nodes previously requested from have disconnected. Surely there can be circumstances in which this could take a very long time for these nodes to disconnect, during which time only orphan blocks can be requested, and the blockchain would appear stuck during this time. Or am I missing something?\n",
