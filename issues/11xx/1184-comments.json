This is why it is mentioned in about every newbie guide about bitcoind/bitcoin-qt that regular backups should be made of the wallet.\n\nThe keys in your wallet determine solely what coins you have access to, transactions are only stored in the wallet for efficiency. When double-spending or using a wallet in multiple places, the wallet can get confused which coins are spent and which are not. That cannot result in any permanent loss. There are tools for removing transactions from your wallet, for example, -zapwallettxes that was added recently, but there have been external tools out there forever like pywallet that can do this. Followed by a rescan this will leave only confirmed transactions.\n\nThis also has nothing to do with mtgox. They aren't even using our software. It is unknown what happened to them at this point, so insinuating that some 'interesting' issue that you posted 2 years ago caused their loss of coins is extremely irresponsible.\n",

And I disagree, this bug of course can contribute to one losing coins since it makes the wallet balance seem higher than it is, so humans seeing this might assume they have the number of coins as shown in the balance when in fact they have less.\n\n@laanwj \"transactions are only stored in the wallet for efficiency\" - what are you implying by saying this? That people shouldn't depend on the transactions as being accurate as the wallet isn't designed for this purpose? This is pretty big disclaimer if so, and really should be displayed in all places where people might be relying on this information as being accurate.\n\nI don't see where the irresponsibility that you suggest is - I think it's irresponsible to not be taking this more seriously.\n",
