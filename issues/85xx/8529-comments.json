If someone feels the need to do that, they're obviously using it in a way that's not currently being discussed here, so I'd like to know the goal.\n\nI also think that trying to reimplement the old prioritization mechanism would be hard and pointless. It would need to query the mempool, create a full in-memory copy of it complete with indexes, sort it by alternative criteria, then compute the effects of CPFP so it can compensated for, and continuously call prioritizetransaction.\n\nProviding a helper script to automate some higher-level behaviour would be useful if we know what that behaviour is, but emulating the old priority-based sorting would be a complicated and inefficient hack, and giving a bad example.\n",
