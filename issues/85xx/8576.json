   "body" : "The current gpg release key used for signing binaries and SHA256SUM is commonly (bitcoin.org for example) referenced to be legit because of an announcement on the bitcoin-dev mailinglist:\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-June/009045.html\n\nThe message on bitcoin-dev cannot be verified easily because the pipermail web version mangled laanwj@gmail.com to  laanwj at gmail.com which is not easy to know and fix for anyone trying to verify.\n\nI'd suggest to (because that's where I went to look)\na)  include the release-key in the git repo of bitcoin/bitcoin in contrib and to include a version that is signed by other core devs  like https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x90C8019E36C2E964 or https://bitcoin.org/laanwj-releases.asc\nb) avoid linking to https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-June/009045.html or at least explaining how to verify the message there by stating it needs to be manually fixed to verify (again bitcoin.org not in the power of bitcoin-core itself)\n\nEdit:  https://bitcoin.org/laanwj-releases.asc is in fact signed by 0x74810B012346C9A6 so that's good, could possible use more sigs.\n",
