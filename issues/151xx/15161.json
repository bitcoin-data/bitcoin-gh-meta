   "body" : "As previously discussed (well put by @laanwj [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14787#issuecomment-441190995)), there is a problem with the structure of the documents in /doc. The main problem is that the documents are meant to be read in two different contexts: \r\n\r\n1. On Github or in a cloned repo\r\n1. In a downloaded archive \r\n\r\nThe latter also has been packaged by the build process into a slightly different file structure. \r\n\r\n_This situation makes it very hard to write good documentation that is on point in both contexts, and I strongly believe the docs need to be separated somehow._\r\n\r\nI'm not sure which strategy is best though. Should the build process be tweaked or can the problem be solved with just file names? I imagine other GitHub projects may have similar problems, how are they usually solved? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
