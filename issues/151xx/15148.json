The node does not recover after some time.\r\nWe are not sure that the constant reboots are a way to resolve this issue and are looking for help.\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\nThe issue occurs from time to time with no real steps to reproduce. We are currently unaware on how to reproduce the issue on our own.\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nBitcoin Core 0.16.3 (bitcoin-0.16.3-x86_64-linux-gnu), grabbed from https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.16.3/\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nUbuntu 16.04 instance with 8 vCPU, 16Gb RAM and SSD.\r\nThe machine also runs some other crypto wallets, however, disk is not overloaded with activity and handles (or at least it seems so) just fine.\r\n<!-- For the GUI-related issue on Linux provide names and versions of a distro, a desktop environment and a graphical shell (if relevant). -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\nWe are doing quite a bunch of RPC requests on this node. Something about 25 requests per second on average, mostly getRawTransaction and validateAddress.\r\nIs this an OK load for bitcoind? Are there any suggestions on how to tweak RPC or related node params? I haven't seen any specific suggestions on the Internet except for \"max them out and pray that your machine handles it\"",
