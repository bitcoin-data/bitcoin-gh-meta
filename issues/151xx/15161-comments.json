This document is used in two contexts which conflict.\r\n\r\nThe straightforward solution would be to split it up; keep the current `doc/README.md` as a ToC for our documentation folder (for people browsing it on github) and create a separate document that is packaged as \"getting started\" by the build system.\r\n",

Example:  I believe `README_windows.txt` is only meant to be read in the context of an archive, but being located in `doc` and being named as a README, I think some readers may read it out of context. \r\n\r\nHowever, since `doc/README.md` is the main problem, I'll close this issue and rephrase in a new one.\r\n",
