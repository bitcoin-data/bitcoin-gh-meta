I would really like to see the existing bullet points kept, as they quickly describe the user-visible changes in the section where readers would expect to learn about those changes.\r\n\r\nIf you then remove the corresponding changes from the new section, you have a section that describes the long-standing behavior of Bitcoin Core---which is not something that belongs in a *new* release note.  And, while I agree that it's better to have documentation somewhere than nowhere, I don't think understanding this concept is important enough for most users of Bitcoin Core (who don't use it as a waching-only or multisig wallet) that we should subject them to learning about it in the release notes we want all users to read before upgrading.\r\n\r\nAlthough solvability and spendability are mostly wallet concepts, the only way the user can really interface with those concepts right now is through the RPC, so I think it would not be inappropriate to add that documentation to the RPC overview: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md  If that is done, than a link can be added to the release notes pointing to that documentation (e.g. one of the getaddressinfo bullet points in the current release notes describes solvability; a link can be added to the end of it for \"Learn more\").\r\n\r\nAs for the actual text, I'd suggest rearranging the first two bullet points so that you can describe the second in terms of differences from the first:\r\n\r\n- A script is *spendable* if the wallet can construct the transaction input to\r\n  spend outputs to the script and produce all required signatures or witness data.\r\n\r\n- If you can do everything except produce the required signatures or witness data, then a script is *solvable*.",
