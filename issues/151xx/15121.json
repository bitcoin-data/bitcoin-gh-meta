   "body" : "When  orphan transactions are evicted form the MapOrphanTransactions pool they are chosen based on their transaction id.\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/378fdfabbae8f4a6e058151d3750ff27f310b4fc/src/net_processing.cpp#L785-L791\r\n\r\n However transaction ids can be easily forged (e.g: resigning the transaction until it falls under a certain threshold), what will make the distribution of the ids in the pool not uniform and therefore the orphan selection will be biased. Such a bias makes forged orphans harder to be \"randomly\" picked. Picking the orphan to be evicted at random based on its position in the MapOrphanTransactions pool seems a better solution.\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to #14897, and solving it will also help prevent inferring techniques such as [TxProbe](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00942.pdf), which takes advantage of the current orphan eviction mechanism.
