   "body" : "This is a rebase of #11639 with some fixes for the last few comments which were not yet addressed.\r\n\r\nThe original PR text, with some strikethroughs of text that is no longer correct:\r\n\r\n> This cleans up an old main-carryover - it made sense that main could decide what DoS scores to assign things because the DoS scores were handled in a different part of main, but now validation is telling net_processing what DoS scores to assign to different things, which is utter nonsense. Instead, we replace CValidationState's nDoS and CorruptionPossible with a general ValidationInvalidReason, which net_processing can handle as it sees fit. I keep the behavior changes here to a minimum, but in the future we can utilize these changes for other smarter behavior, such as disconnecting/preferring to rotate outbound peers based on them providing things which are invalid due to SOFT_FORK because we shouldn't ban for such cases.\r\n> \r\n> This is somewhat complementary with, though obviously conflicts heavily with #11523, which added enums in place of DoS scores, as well as a few other cleanups (which are still relevant).\r\n> \r\n> Compared with previous bans, the following changes are made:\r\n> \r\n> Txn with empty vin/vout or null prevouts move from 10 DoS\r\n> points to 100.\r\n> Loose transactions with a dependency loop now result in a ban\r\n> instead of 10 DoS points.\r\n> ~~BIP68-violation no longer results in a ban as it is SOFT_FORK.~~\r\n> ~~Non-SegWit SigOp violation no longer results in a ban as it\r\n> considers P2SH sigops and is thus SOFT_FORK.~~\r\n> ~~Any script violation in a block no longer results in a ban as\r\n> it may be the result of a SOFT_FORK. This should likely be\r\n> fixed in the future by differentiating between them.~~\r\n> Proof of work failure moves from 50 DoS points to a ban.\r\n> Blocks with timestamps under MTP now result in a ban, blocks\r\n> too far in the future continue to not result in a ban.\r\n> Inclusion of non-final transactions in a block now results in a\r\n> ban instead of 10 DoS points.\r\n\r\nNote: The change to ban all peers for consensus violations is actually NOT the change I'd like to make -- I'd prefer to only ban outbound peers in those situations.  The current behavior is a bit of a mess, however, and so in the interests of advancing this PR I tried to keep the changes to a minimum.  I plan to revisit the behavior in a followup PR.\r\n\r\nEDIT: One reviewer suggested I add some additional context for this PR:\r\n\r\n> The goal of this work was to make net_processing aware of the actual reasons for validation failures, rather than just deal with opaque numbers instructing it to do something.\r\n> \r\n> In the future, I'd like to make it so that we use more context to decide how to punish a peer. One example is to differentiate inbound and outbound peer misbehaviors. Another potential example is if we'd treat RECENT_CONSENSUS_CHANGE failures differently (ie after the next consensus change is implemented), and perhaps again we'd want to treat some peers differently than others.",
