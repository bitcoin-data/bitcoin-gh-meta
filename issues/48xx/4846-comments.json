In fact, there's probably a better way to determine whether to broadcast an inv than using the height number - i.e. broadcast if their height is lower OR if their latest block is not in our best chain. (Although actually, this is probably good to go, as we could broadcast our latest block inv the moment we realise their latest block is not in our best chain - if I add that code also, then this pull is probably then ready to merge).\n\n(This pull is dependent on aa815647005bc8467f467c35a9e617794446cd64)\n",

It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3.
