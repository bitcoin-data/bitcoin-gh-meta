      "body" : "I have thought about on how to bring this to the GUI. After all, I cannot\nthink of something which I consider as an improvement for the user.\nI have several concerns here:\n- most important, smartfee can not tell the minFee. smartfee just recommends what other people are paying.\n  Even if you set -txconfirmtarget to 25, it is higher than the minFee. Me, as a \"smart\" user,  \n  I know that the minFee is 1000 per kb, so I just look at the daily transaction volume, then I know that \n  sending the minFee is just fine. For example estimateFee(25) was returning 5081. Then I sended a low-priority\n  transaction with only 300 satoshis in fee. (txsize < 300 bytes). Guess how long it took to confirm? 8 minutes.\n  So smartfees recommendation, calling it with 25, in this case was not so smart.\n  I wouldnt recommend people to use smartfee, instead I would recommend:\n  \"Ignore smartFee, as long as there is enough space in the blocks, always only send the minFee of 1000/kb\"\n  One of the most important questions to users is, What is the minFee? smartFee doesnt know.\n- smartFee estimations are not inaccurate, they are just wrong. In the example above smartFee was telling me\n  \n  \"If you pay 44444/kb it will take 1 block to confirm\"\n  \n  \"If you pay 5081/kb it will take 25 block to confirm\"\n  \n  Well, I paid 1000/kb and it took 1 block to confirm. (300 for a <300 bytes transaction)\n- I am not convinced by the bucket-algorithm: \n  I added a tab which shows the buckets in the debug-window (the first row shows result of estimatefee(x)):\n  ![smartfee2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2814559/4778719/a7528b22-5bfd-11e4-95b1-45c8396dc1cc.png)\n  ![smartfee3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2814559/4778720/adcebb1a-5bfd-11e4-936b-15154bd56a58.png)\n  \n  If you ask me, all buckets look kinda the same. So we are claiming, we can predict how much you have to pay to get confirmed in e.g. 13 blocks, from buckets which look all the same?\n- Even if all miners would set their minFee to 1 satoshi, smartFee would still recommend what other people are paying,\n  regardless of miners minFee setting.\n- smartFee does not know, whether there is lots of space in the blocks or not. But in order to be an actually smart smartFee, we would need to know. \n- Unrelated to smartfee: we cant even show an absolute fee in the gui, even if we know the inputs and outputs. Showing only\n  a per kb value to the user is more confusing than helping. Thats bitcoin design, but it doesnt help, when thinking about\n  the GUI feature: \"choose fee per transaction\"\n\nI am not claiming to know better and really appreciate the work being done on smartFee, but after all I think its trying to solve something which cant be solved with bitcoins current design. \n\nFor now, I would rather remove the estimations from 1 to 25 completely and only have an estimateFee() that answers the question \"How much to get in now for sure?\". At least this can be used for a floating free-priority-threshold as we already do.\n",

      "body" : "@cozz Thanks for looking into this. \n\nThe reason I'd like to give the user some control and transparency over the fee on a per-transaction basis is that the estimation for `-txconfirmtarget=1` can be quite high! And users may not always care at all about fast incorporation of their transaction into blocks, so the fee is essentially wasted. And this gives Bitcoin an 'expensive' name, even though it doesn't have to be (but now you have to fiddle with command line arguments to avoid this).\n\nAdding the estimates to the debug window is a nice idea, at least it provides some more transparency into what is happening, for developers. That's a step forward.\n\nTBH: I personally used `-txconfirmtarget=10000` and it still confirmed in 10-15 minutes.\n",

After all the data size is what you're paying for when you send a transaction. Maybe we could show some accounting for that in the 'confirm' window... People understand having to pay for data in other contexts, so it would give at least _some_ clue at how the client comes up with a certain number, that it doesn't look completely random.\n",
