Official builds must be created using an entirely free/open stack, including the toolchain. mingw is much easier to automate for c-i and deployments, so it's the obvious choice for us.\n\nHowever, there's no reason why the code shouldn't build under MSVC.  Any build failure (assuming it's caused by non-conformant code as opposed to a MSVC quirk) is a bug and should be fixed.\n",

What projects usually do is to have a parallel build system specifically for MSVC, i.e. by checking in a solution file. But it will be a maintenance burden to make sure that doesn't get out of sync when files are moved around. Maybe it would be possible to generate a MSVC solution file from the current build system somehow.\n\nI also know it's possible to call the MSVC compiler from WINE, so scripting to run it automatically on a linux host would be possible, which can make it a little easier for the other developers without windows to check it as well.\n\nSeems like quite some work, but if you think it's worth the trouble, why not.\n",

That I could help with much more, as I'd like to see it happen. \n\n@theuni  I am not sure if this is what you wanted to see but it looks like there is no easy way to get these generated files so I setup MinGW on Windows 7 and did the build. It builds the BitcoinD with no issues except it requires a fix for boost 1.56 bug which is described in workarounds directory. I didn't bother with QT but I am sure it could be done as well.   https://github.com/ENikS/bitcoin-dev-mingw\n",

It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n\nThis test script verifies pulls every time they are updated. It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.  If you are waiting on a test, please check timestamps to verify that the test.log is moving at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/current/\nContact BlueMatt on freenode if something looks broken.\n",
