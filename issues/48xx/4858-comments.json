Because of ABI issues you must build the dependencies with the same compiler that you use for bitcoin itself.\n\nHis idea is to make it easier to build in mingw in windows (i.e. just `make -C depends && ./autogen.sh && ./configure` like in other OSes). But that's completely parallel to the topic of building in MSVC. Different people have different choices in compiler, and it's no problem to accommodate multiple choices as long as someone actively maintains them.\n",

Nothing just works instantly on any new platform.  automake/autoconf in itself is platform independent as well, but when building native software there are always platform-dependent weirdnesses that have to be taken into account.\n\nI don't feel like arguing the pros and cons of build systems here. We only recently switched from loose makefiles to autoconf/automake, which is only now starting to stabilize and \"just work\". Switching to something else again means going through another phase of build system frustration.\n\n(if you want my personal opinion about build systems: I prefer cmake, which can generate MSVC solution files.. but as said that doesn't matter here)\n",

I can't just say \"HEXDUMP xyz file\" in command prompt, I can not do in in simple Perl either. So for me to just generate these files I have to go through entire build process with Mingw on Windows. I already spent whole weekend trying to generate these few files and for what?!\n\nDon't get me wrong but it looks like you deliberately trying to make this process as hard as possible for other people working on other platforms.
