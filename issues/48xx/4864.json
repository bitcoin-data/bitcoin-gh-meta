The certificate containing the public key of the entity that digitally signed the PaymentRequest MUST be the first certificate.'\n\nI only have the one cert I got from the comodo so I think I only need to supply the raw byte data of the cert to satisfy this one which already exists in the form of `x509_bytes` above, so...\n\n```\nrepeated bytes certificate = x509_bytes\n```\n\nAm I close??\n\nAlso I notice that `repeated bytes certificate` comes after `optional bytes signature` but shouldn't I deal with that before `message PaymentRequest` so that I can serialise it into my http response somehow?\n\nEDIT:\n\nFor what it's worth I'm aware that I need to import, instantiate and in some cases serialise these methods before sending them as a request/response but what I'm looking for are the methods on how to manipulate and supply the information required.\n\nThanks :)\n",
