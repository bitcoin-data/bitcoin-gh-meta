   "body" : "`GetAdjustedTime()` (used e.g. in validation and addrman) returns a time with an offset that is influenced by timestamps that our peers have sent us in their version message.\r\n\r\nCurrently, timestamps from all peers are used for this.\r\nHowever, I think that it would make sense to ignore the timedata samples from inbound peers, making it much harder for others to influence the Adjusted Time in a targeted way.\r\nWith the extra feeler connections (every 2 minutes on average) and extra block-relay-only connections (every 5 minutes on average) there are also now plenty of opportunities to gather a meaningful number of timedata samples from outbound peers.\r\n\r\nThere are some measures in place to prevent abuse: the `-maxtimeadjustment` parameter with a default of 70 minutes, warnings in cases of large deviations, only using the first 200 samples ([explanation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/383d350bd5107bfe00e3b90a00cab9a3c1397c72/src/timedata.cpp#L57-L72)), but I think that only using samples from outbound connections in the first place would be an additional safety measure that would make sense. \r\n\r\nSee also issue #4521 for further context and links: There have been several discussions in the past about replacing or abolishing the existing timedata system.\r\n",
