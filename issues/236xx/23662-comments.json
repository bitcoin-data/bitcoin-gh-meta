The performance worries on the second commit concerns transactions that are in `wallet.mapWallet` but don't satisfy the `IsMine` predicate (which should be all txs sent from the wallet to an address not owned by the wallet) ; if the search in the output script set (`output_scripts.count(...)`) takes longer than the `IsMine` check, then on master the loop iteration would be faster for those transactions. On the other hand a search in std::set takes O(log n), so it shouldn't be that bad.\r\n\r\nWould be very interested in further opinions.",

In the current version of the PR though, `IsMine` is not called in the hot spot (mapWallet/CTxOut iteration loop) anymore.

The functional test [wallet_pr23662.py](https://github.com/theStack/bitcoin/blob/pr23662_benchmarks/test/functional/wallet_pr23662.py) (not part of this PR) creates transactions with 15000 different addresses:\r\n- 5000 outputs (500 txs with 10 outputs each) with label set, IsMine set (received)\r\n- 5000 outputs (500 txs with 10 outputs each) with label set, IsMine not set (sent)\r\n- 5000 outputs (500 txs with 10 outputs each) without label set, IsMine not set (sent)\r\n\r\nThen, the time is measured for calling `getreceivedbyaddress` and `getreceivedbylabel`, the latter with two variants. Results on my machine:\r\n\r\n| branch | `getreceivedbyaddress` (single) | `getreceivedbylabel` (single) | `getreceivedbylabel` (10000) |\r\n|---------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|\r\n| master | 406.13ms| 425.33ms | 446.58ms |\r\n| PR (first commit) | 367.18ms| 365.81ms| 426.33ms |\r\n| PR (second commit) | 3.96ms | 4.83ms | 339.69ms |\r\n\r\nSeems like my worries (\"the second commit is potentially more controversial, as it could actually hurt performance if users put a huge number of addresses under the same label\") are not justified and most of the performance gain is indeed achieved by the second commit. Improvement ideas to the benchmark are very welcome, though I'd consider this pretty safe to merge at this point.",

Guess some benchmarking is needed here, how much is performance gains / losses in different scenarios.\r\n\r\nPerformance would only be hurt if a label had a huge number of addressees that did not belong to the wallet and for that to matter, there would need to be way more addresses than outputs stored in the wallet. Even for JoinMarket users (probably especially for JoinMarket users too), it will be faster because instead of doing `IsMine` on every single output of every single transaction in a wallet (which for coinjoins the vast majority will be irrelevant to the wallet), it is doing `IsMine` on things that are in the address book. For most users, the set of addresses in the address book will be smaller than the number of transaction outputs in a wallet.",

Have an error string targeting `getreceivedbyaddress` -> \"Address not found in wallet\" and another one for `getreceivedbylabel` -> \"label not found in wallet\".\r\n\r\nIn any case, just opened #25122.
