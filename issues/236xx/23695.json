   "body" : "Currently we serialize the local time when connecting to outbound connections and the \"adjusted network\" time when someone connects to us.\r\n\r\nI presume the reason is to avoid a fingerprint in case the local time is misconfigured. However, the fingerprint still exits when:\r\n* The local time goes out-of-sync after timedata is filled up, in which case the adjusted time is *not* adjusted. See comment in `src/timedata.cpp`. (In practise I expect no adjustment to happen after timedata is filled up by one entry more than half its size).\r\n* The local time is off by more than 70 minutes. See `DEFAULT_MAX_TIME_ADJUSTMENT`. While there is a warning in this case, the warning might be missed by the node operator.\r\n* The adjusted time is poisoned by an attacker. This is only a theoretical concern after commit e457513eb1bad11482f0820feb0f5810324a9d06.\r\n\r\nUsing the adjusted time does help in a the case where the local time is off by a constant less than 70 minutes and the node quickly connects to 5 outbound peers to retrieve the adjusted time.\r\n\r\nStill, I think using `GetAdjustedTime` here gives a false sense of security. It will be better for node operators to instead set the correct time.",
