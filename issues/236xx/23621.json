   "body" : "A subtle (and minor) bug in how limits are calculated & checked in `CalculateAncestorsAndCheckLimits` https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/txmempool.cpp#L207\r\n\r\nThis helper can be invoked in a few cases:\r\n\r\n1. `CTxMemPool::CalculateMemPoolAncestors` invokes it, if `fSearchForParents` is `true`, and `entry` is not in the mempool, then `CalculateAncestorsAndCheckLimits` will be exact/correct.\r\n2. `CTxMemPool::CalculateMemPoolAncestors` invokes it, in the cases where `entry` is already in the mempool, we have an off-by-one error here https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/txmempool.cpp#L230 (because `stageit->GetCountWithDescendants()` will include `entry` in its count\r\n\r\n**So (2) highlights the case where there's a bug, and it's quite common.**\r\n\r\nWe also need to think about how `CTxMemPool::CheckPackageLimits` uses this helper. I think it works better in this case because we have the assumption:\r\n```\r\nCalculate all in-mempool ancestors of a set of transactions not already in the mempool and\r\n* check ancestor and descendant limits\r\n```\r\nie we know none of the txns in `package` are in the mempool. So no double counting.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI doubt this is a serious bug, but I though it's at least worth bringing up. It also seemed tricky to fix this with minimal/simple changes that works in all cases this helper is/may be used.\r\n\r\nie here https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/txmempool.cpp#L309, when `fSearchForParents` is `true` and one/some of the parents of this transaction **are not** in the mempool. Currently these parents (and any of their potential ancestors) are not included in the unconfirmed parents check. Again I don't know if this actually matters, or if its unnecessary complexity, but want to check",
