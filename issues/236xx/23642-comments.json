However, now the type-solving happens rather twice (once in `ScriptPubKeyToUniv`, a second time immediately after its call) rather than \"earlier\", isn't it? Not sure though if this is really a problem for the performance, probably the RPC call overhead is already an order of magnitude higher than the solving itself, so that it doesn't really matter if it's done twice.",
