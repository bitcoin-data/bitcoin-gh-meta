   "body" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhile testing `22.0rc2` external signer feature, I noticed that if multiple HW wallets are connected to the computer, `createwallet` will always pick the first one without alerting the user in any way. This led to the following unexpected behavior:\r\n\r\n1. attach a trezor and create a wallet using `bitcoin-cli createwallet`\r\n2. attach a coldcard while the trezor is still connected and create a second wallet with `bitcoin-cli createwallet`\r\n\r\nBoth wallets were created fine with no errors, but on further inspection I realized both wallets were connected to the trezor, despite having different names. This is related to #22635 \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIdeally, if multiple external signers are returned from `enumeratesigners` and I then try to create a wallet, I would want `createwallet` to fail and warn me there are multiple external signers. Additionally, an option to specify the fingerprint of the device would be useful, but I think simply failing would be sufficient for now.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nGranted, this is a rare case where a user would have multiple HW's connected while creating a single sig wallet, so perhaps just documenting that you should only have one connected at a time is a viable solution.\r\n",
