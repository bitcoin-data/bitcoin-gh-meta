This ensures that the dependencies available to each package are deterministic and minimal. If parallel builds were allowed, there may be 2 or more packages extracting their deps to the host prefix simultaneously. This would mean that builds at different `-j` levels might see different headers and libs \"installed\".\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to have a unique prefix for each package to use, but that would require post-processing each package to set a canonical prefix after the fact in order to work with autoconf's notion of using a single prefix. IMO that's not worth the trouble.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: Removing `.NOTPARALLEL` safely would require a significant rework of depends.",
