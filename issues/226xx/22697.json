   "body" : "`CAddrMan::Clear()` exists to reset the internal state of `CAddrMan`. It's currently used in two places:\r\n\r\n- on startup, if deserializing peers.dat fails, `Clear()` is called to reset to an empty addrman\r\n- in tests, `Clear()` is called to reset the addrman for more tests\r\n\r\nIn both cases, we can simply destruct the `CAddrMan` and construct a new, empty addrman. That approach is safer - it's possible that `Clear()` could 'reset' the addrman to a state that's not equivalent to a freshly constructed addrman (one actual example of this is that `Clear()` does not clear the `m_tried_collisions` set). On the other hand, if we destruct and then construct a fresh addrman, we're guaranteed that the new object is empty.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't possible when addrman was initially implemented, since it was a global, and so it would only be destructed on shutdown. However, addrman is now owned by `node.context`, so we have control over its destruction/construction.",
