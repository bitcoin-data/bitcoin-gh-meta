   "body" : "This PR enables a part of the non-wallet functional test  (rpc_signmessage.py) to be run even with the Bitcoin Core wallet disabled, it is inspired by #20078.\r\n\r\nDivided tests in rpc_signmessage.py into 2 files wallet_signmessagewithaddress.py and rpc_signmessagewithprivkey.py, latter one can run even when wallet is disabled that provides extra test which was not performed earlier.\r\n\r\n* we need bitcoincore wallet to run  rpc_signmessage.py, but it is olny required for signing messages with address and not for signing messages wih private key, so latter one can be in a seperate test which can run without wallet\r\n* verifying message doesn't require wallet, so it can be used in both tests without any problem\r\n* 2 tests are named as wallet_signmessagewithaddress.py and rpc_signmessagewithprivkey.py to provide clarity of what they are testing.",
