I could see how the small difference in log statement was more meaningful when a peer was added via IRC :) \r\n\r\nNow, the definition of `Add()` that takes in a single address is only invoked from the hidden/test-only RPC `addpeeraddress`. These changes should not cause any observable difference, and are covered by the existing tests that use this RPC endpoint.",
