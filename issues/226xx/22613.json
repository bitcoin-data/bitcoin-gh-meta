All of the code that works with `struct sockaddr` needs to be inspected and fixed. For example here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b620b2d58a55a88ad21da70cb2000863ef17b651/src/netaddress.cpp#L988\r\n\r\nIt is illegal/UB in C++ to do this type of aliasing and dereference a pointer that is `reinterpre_cast`ed in this way.  C++ has stricter aliasing rules than C. For reference, see this: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reinterpret_cast#Type_aliasing\r\n\r\n**Suggested Fix**\r\n\r\nUse `std::memcpy` to copy the structs around and dereference them after copying them.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue? What is your operating system and its version? If Linux, what is your desktop environment and graphical shell? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n",
