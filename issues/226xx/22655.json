I also had the following in my configuration file:\r\n\r\n> listen=1\r\n> assumevalid=0\r\n> dbcache=1000\r\n> addresstype=bech32\r\n> avoidpartialspends=1\r\n> changetype=bech32\r\n> maxapsfee=0.01\r\n> i2psam=127.0.0.1:7656\r\n> debug=tor\r\n> debug=i2p\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\nReproduces reliably following the above steps.\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nSelf compiled Bitcoin Core, with `./configure --without-miniupnpc --without-natpmp --enable-hardening --without-bdb --with-qrencode --disable-zmq --with-sqlite=yes`\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nQubes 4.0.4, in a Debian-10 standalone-VM with normal networking. Intel x86_64. SSD\r\nNothing weird in `debug.log`\r\n\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue? What is your operating system and its version? If Linux, what is your desktop environment and graphical shell? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
