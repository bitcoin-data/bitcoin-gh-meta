And all the new code must be maintained forever :)\r\n\r\n> The proposed method is much more efficient than the boost/algorithm/string/split. Here is a small demonstration which performs the same task in just 11 microseconds compared to boost library which takes 30 microseconds.\r\n\r\nI don't think the efficiency of the current code is an issue.\r\n\r\n> Boost removal is an eventual goal of the project.\r\n\r\nAfter adding `boost::process` it looks like a moving target :)",
