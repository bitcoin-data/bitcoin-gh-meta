Runtime of this test seems to be identical to what it was before this PR - I also should note this test turns out to be a really good benchmark for this PR as it is a pretty good worst-case scenario and stress test for doing tons of rbf signaling checks",

That's an issue regardless of what policy Bitcoin Core implements.\r\n\r\nI think the security issue is qualified in the consequences for downstream Bitcoin users of the code defect _compared_  to the standard. Such standard committed by Core in `doc/bips.md`.\r\n\r\nIn a decentralized system such as Bitcoin, I don't think we can admit an authoritative enumeration of the valid assumptions an application can draw on the p2p network. It's more constructive to argue in the way \"If we assume X, is Y safer, cheaper, easier-to-design ?\".\r\n\r\nIf we assume BIP152 to be widely deployed, block propagation is faster and overall network security better.\r\nIf we assume BIP330 to be widely deployed, transaction bandwidth consumption is better and cost-to-run a full-node lower.\r\nIf we assume BIP125 to be widely deployed,  LN security is better as LN nodes can adapt to mempools congestion.\r\n\r\nFollowing this reasoning, as protocol developers, I think we can rationally discuss about the benefits of assumptions for the wider ecosystem and even how to make them more \"binding\".",

I'm hoping this also makes it easier to reason about `PreChecks()` performance, and any potential for increased DoS surface.\r\n- improve performance, I believe `getrawmempool` (verbose) and `getmempoolentry` will run faster in all-cases (and possibly significantly faster in worst-case scenarios) than before this PR due to this optimization. But I think `PreChecks()` performance is probably more important, and more work is done in `PreChecks()` to check for inherited signaling after this PR -- so we need to ensure that is acceptable.",

I was hesitant before because I think adherence to this interpretation of BIP125#1 (which was written after the code) is insufficient rationale; it is better to focus on implementing what's appropriate for the node. I realized it's better to implement inherited signaling for now (independent of any full RBF plans), as it's a simpler interface for wallets. Right now, descendants of replaceable transactions _are_ replaceable despite not \"inheriting\" signaling (simply replace its signaling ancestor) but wallets devs shoudn't need to work around that.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping to document and test the RBF logic!",

Some of them might be using BTCD which has inherited signaling. However, [99% of Bitcoin nodes](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/software.html) use Bitcoin Core as Bitcoin full node. Please share the link to issue/PR if you create one in any LN implementation (would follow the discussion) because [RBF is just a mempool policy and cannot be enforced](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/105576/103136), _so nothing would prevent nodes (or even miners)_ from using a different policy if that helps in exploiting vulnerable LN projects.",

Note that it increases the number of potential mempool entries visited from 100 to unlimited.\r\n\r\nI was on the fence about including 658a0f39f11f023c531a78472c9379033574def1 in this PR. I tend to agree it is not necessary for it to be in this PR, and I'd be open to removing it for now. But my thought process was:\r\n- it is related to inherited signaling because there are cases where a transaction should be replaceable due to inherited signaling, but is not due to eviction double counting. And in these cases the bip125-replaceable status that `getmempoolentry` returns will be different than what the mempool will treat as replaceable. Which is something I wanted to be totally consistent after this PR\r\n- **Note that it increases the number of potential mempool entries visited from 100 to unlimited.** This is a great point, and I want this to be front-and-center in this PR. It is not just the case in `MemPoolAccept::PreChecks`, but also the case in `IsRBFOptIn` 831ecb0cc0d2bb66f0aecde01df0ccfe00d6b510. Instead we rely on the local mempool's policy to put a hard bound on the work we do to determine inherited signaling:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndefault mempool limits are much stricter than BIP125 Rule 5's MAX_BIP125_REPLACEMENT_CANDIDATES{100},\r\nbecause DEFAULT_DESCENDANT_LIMIT == 25\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my testing/implementation I found this was a safe _assumption_ (I discuss this more in the PR description). But this is the risk of this PR and we need to be sure we don't introduce a DOS vector here. Which I don't believe we do, but the reviewers who know much better than me will need to confirm this.",

      "body" : "> Note that it increases the number of potential mempool entries visited from 100 to unlimited. This is a great point, and I want this to be front-and-center in this PR. It is not just the case in MemPoolAccept::PreChecks, but also the case in IsRBFOptIn 831ecb0.\r\n\r\nRight, I hadn't noticed that it was the case in both. Limiting to 100 direct conflicts and default ancestor limits means up to 2500 entry lookups. But both `IsRBFOptIn` and `GetItersForConflicting` are worse because the number of direct conflicts hasn't been restricted at all. It can contain much more than 100 - the limit is the number of inputs you can cram into a 100KvB transaction. The two functions combined can cause you to search all of the ancestors and all of the descendants, and the inputs don't even need valid signatures because you haven't done script checks yet. It can probably cover your entire mempool.\r\n\r\nI think as long as you fail faster, you can still get decent bounds (based on the anc/desc limit). Have you also considered an alternative approach for signaling checks - instead of searching ancestor sets of all conflicts every time, caching a signaling bool in mempool entries? It's an extra bit for every transaction, but perhaps we can pack it somewhere in `CTxMemPoolEntry`. We would also need to update entries on removal (limited to `limitdescendantcount`). I haven't really dug into it - it's possible that the alternative approach is worse - but maybe worth thinking about?",
