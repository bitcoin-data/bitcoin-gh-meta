Instead, you could add it to `WalletClient` (have `WalletClient` also parse the `-fallbackfee` option) and retrieve it from there via `NodeContext`. When wallets are disabled, `NodeContext.wallet_client` will just be nullptr, and in that situation, `-fallbackfee` couldn't have been set and so doesn't matter for the fee estimation.",
