   "body" : "This PR does not change behavior. It extracts the BIP125 logic into helper functions (and puts them in the policy/rbf* files). This enables three things - I think each one individually is pretty good:\r\n\r\n- Implementation of package RBF (see #22290). I want it to be as close to BIP125 as possible so that it doesn't become a distinct fee-bumping mechanism. Doing these move-only commits first means the diff is mostly mechanical to review, and I just need to create a function that mirrors the single transaction validation.\r\n- We will be able to isolate and test our RBF logic alone. Recently, there have been some discussions on discrepancies between our code and BIP125, as well as proposals for improving it. Generally, I think making this code more modular and de-bloating validation.cpp is probably a good idea.\r\n- Witness Replacement (replacing same-txid-different-wtxid when the witness is significantly smaller and therefore higher feerate) in a BIP125-similar way. Hopefully it can just be implemented with calls to the rbf functions (i.e. `PaysForRBF`) and an edit to the relevant mempool entries.",
