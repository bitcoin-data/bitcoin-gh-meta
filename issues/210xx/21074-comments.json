The idea for #19339 not changing `allowed` from False to True was, as @MarcoFalke said, because that'd actually be a breaking change, so it just changes the reject reason instead. I don't think users would be surprised by the behavior given current documentation.\r\n\r\nMoving forward, if I were to propose something, I'd maybe have `allowed` represent \"everything ok,\" and then for \"allowed=False\" add a `problem-type` field for `CONSENSUS`, `MEMPOOL_POLICY`, `USER_CONFIG`, or `UNFINISHED_VALIDATION`. Just throwing the idea out there.",
