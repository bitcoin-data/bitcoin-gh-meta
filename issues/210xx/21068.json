   "body" : "Add GitHub Codespaces integration.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it easier to onboard new contributors to Bitcoin Core by providing a web based development environment that is trivial to setup.\r\n\r\nBy starting a GitHub Codespace instance using this integration in this PR a developer gets access to a configured C++ IDE with typical IDE features such as working code completion, refactoring tools (rename function, etc.), etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition the IDE environment a Linux environment is spun up by GitHub Codespaces. This Linux environment is accessible via a web based terminal. A new developer can run say `make && src/bitcoind -regtest` in the web based terminal after making a small change and see the results of his/her work immediately while staying in the browser. Instant gratification! :)\r\n\r\nGitHub Codespaces is not magic. It is simply the combination of three things:\r\n\r\n* A web based editor/IDE\r\n* A web based terminal\r\n* Access to a private Linux instance which is accessible via said web based terminal\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### How to test this PR\r\n\r\nRequest access to GitHub Codespaces which is currently in beta:\r\n* Go to https://github.com/features/codespaces and apply: applications seem to be approved automatically within a day or two AFAICT.\r\n\r\nOnce you have beta access to GitHub Codespaces:\r\n* Go to https://github.com/codespaces.\r\n* Click \"Create your first codespace\".\r\n* You can now either enter a repo/branch you control which contains the commit from this PR, or you can use my demo repo `bitcoin-codespaces/bitcoin` and the branch `master`. I've setup the demo repo to allow for easy testing of this PR: [see this diff for the changes between `bitcoin-codespaces:master` and `bitcoin:master`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...bitcoin-codespaces:master). If/when this PR is merged `bitcoin/bitcoin` will be the repo to use of course :)\r\n* Click \"Create codespace\".\r\n* Wait until the initial setup finishes: this will take a couple of minutes on first run.\r\n* Enjoy your new web based IDE! Try making some small change, type `make && src/bitcoind -regtest` in the web based terminal and enjoy your work! :)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/codespaces/codespace-overview.png\" />\r\n\r\n",
