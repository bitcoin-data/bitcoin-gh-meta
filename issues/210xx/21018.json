   "body" : "`listtransactions`/`listsinceblock` don't currently indicate which of the conflicted unconfirmed wallet transactions are considered 'active' (in the node's mempool) and which aren't.\r\n\r\nTo determine this, one currently has to issue an additional `getmempoolentry` rpc call and check if that fails or not. It would be useful if this information was more readily available, without requiring additional calls.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it appears that there's an inconsistency between `gettransaction` and `listtransactions`. Normally, `listtransactions` returns a flattened concatenated list of the `details` for all the wallet transactions, with one entry per `detail` entry. But in this case, `gettransaction` returns an empty `details` array for 'non active' transactions, which should to my understanding translate to the transaction not showing up in `listtransactions` at all, yet it does.\r\n\r\nMy preference would be for 'non active' unconfirmed transactions to show up in both, but with a flag that indicates their status (similarly to `confirmations < 0` for transactions that conflict with confirmed transactions).",
