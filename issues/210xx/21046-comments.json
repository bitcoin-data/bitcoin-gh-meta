General bitcoin questions and/or support requests are best directed to the [Bitcoin StackExchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com) or the `#bitcoin` IRC channel on freenode. Network-wide consensus and/or P2P changes first need to be discussed with the greater community, e.g. the `bitcoin-dev` mailing list. Also, they need a BIP to be implemented in Bitcoin Core and other software that connects to the bitcoin P2P network.",
