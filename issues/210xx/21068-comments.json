This seems great, but I haven't tried it ~and think a demo link would be helpful~.\r\n\r\nHand wringing over this seems strange to me. If the main concern is this will cause spam and low quality contributions, that's an empirical question, not something we need to speculate about. If it causes spam and low quality PRs, it should be pretty obvious and easy to fix by reverting.\r\n\r\nBut I really don't understand what what the concerns about lock-in and dependencies and ecosystems mean in a practical sense. This is no different than providing a .gitignore or a .clang-format file, or an init startup script. It may in fact be true that our [bitcoind.service](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/init/bitcoind.service) file has sent many developers down a dark road and some are attending anonymous groups to support withdrawal from systemd. But I think people should be able to use the tools they want to use, and as long as it doesn't cause an unacceptable maintenance burden, we should support it and try not to get in the way. This PR definitely adds some maintenance burden and it should be maintainers decision whether they want to take it on. But this can be stated plainly as a maintainer preference not a \"really, we are protecting you from yourself\" moral principle.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Somehow I missed the \"How to test this PR\" section of the description. Will apply for access and try it out. It could definitely make sense to avoid merging the PR until the feature is more widely accessible.\r\n\r\n",
