Either the GUI is misleading in the description or it's not behaving as it should.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nChoose one transaction. Choose edit label with mouse right-button. All transactions to that receiving address will change to such label.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\nBitcoin-QT 0.21.0 from bitcoin.org\r\n\r\nMac OS Big Sur, whatever version came out last week\r\n\r\n",
