   "body" : "This adds a field labelled 'Immature' in the overview section under the 'unconfirmed' field, which shows mined\nincome that has not yet matured (which is currently not displayed anywhere, even though the transactions\nexist in the transaction list). To do that I added a 'GetImmatureBalance' method to the wallet, and connected\nthat through to the GUI as per the 'GetBalance' and 'GetUnconfirmedBalance' methods. I did a small 'no-op'\nchange to make the code in adjacent functions a little more readable (imo); it was a change I had made in my\nrepo earlier...but I thought it wouldn't hurt so left it in. Immature balance comes from mined income that is\nat least two blocks deep in the chain (same logic as displayed transactions).\n\nMy reasoning is:\n- as a miner, it's a critical stat I want to see\n- as a miner, and taking into account the label 'immature', the uncertainty is pretty clearly implied\n- those numbers are already displayed in the transaction list\n- this makes the overview numbers add up to what's in the transaction list\n- it's not displayed if the immature balance is 0, so won't bother non-miners\n",
