      "body" : "Slightly tested ACK.\n\nBTW unrelated to this pull, this script is a pain to set up and is a mess. \n- Doesn't support testnet by default\n- Doesn't read bitcoin.conf files - needs user/pass to be provided in text of program itself encouraging accidental committing\n- There's lot of repitition.\n- Should use AuthServiceProxy that is included in the tree instead of having a dependency on a 'jsonrpc' module\n\nAnyone volunteering to give this a overhaul? Or would it be better to just remove it? Main argument I've heard for including this is that entering the `walletpassphrase` on the command line is safer than passing it as argument to bitcoin-cli, but this is not exactly convenient to use.\n",
