Helping readability by reducing the \"OP_\" redundancy was a secondary goal.\n\nI think the growing consensus from the #5264 discussion is that no guarantees to hold these outputs constant have been made. As these changes are made, more unit tests are being added which will firm up these output formats and increase support for those that do want to script against them in the future.\n\nSo, that's at least why this set of changes was put forward.\n",
