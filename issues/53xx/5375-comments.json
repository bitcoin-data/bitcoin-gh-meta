And SPV client, for example Multibit, or the Android Bitcoin Wallet can be pointed at a node that will store and query the blockchain for it and do verification against the UTXO set. It can also be pointed at arbitrary nodes, but using one of your own has privacy and security advantages.\r\n\r\nThere are plans for SPV support for the wallet in Bitcoin Core, eg #3882.\r\n\r\nHowever when and how this will happen is not entirely clear, so I'd suggest to use an already available SPV client.",
