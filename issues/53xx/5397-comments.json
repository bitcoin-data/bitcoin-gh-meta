The concern would be any future mods to this block, should they overlook the regtest use case (and therefore possibly take more dramatic measures operating under the assumption of an infrastructure attack). So, what say you? Is a comment update in order, or a comment update + skip the block entirely if there are no seeds? I have to say the code has managed to handle the different modes remarkably uniformly so far...\n",
