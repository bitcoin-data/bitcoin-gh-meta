Also, a good candidate for thorough doxyfication. @fanquake since you've been poking there lately, did you have plans in mind for hooking up the doxygen output somewhere? It'd be great to find some doxygen->markdown bridge.\n\nFor reference, here's one I randomly stumbled on a few days go:\nhttps://libgit2.github.com/docs/guides/101-samples/\nhttps://libgit2.github.com/libgit2/#HEAD\n\nObviously that's overkill for us now, but assuming the lib trend keeps rolling, it'd be nice to think ahead some.\n",
