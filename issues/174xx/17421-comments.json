Let's say, I've had cases of UTXO database corruption due to failing hardware that weren't detected by that. The only thing that was revealing it was that it was rejecting every single block on the network.\r\n\r\nI mean, how can you even know if your local UTXO database is missing entries (or has additional ones that shouldn't be there)? In a decentralized network, your own database is the only reference.",
