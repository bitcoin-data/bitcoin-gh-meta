   "body" : "A RAW transaction with a fee exceeding DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_MAXFEE was created and tested. The tests were compared using windows Core v0.18.0 and v0.19.0. Core v0.19.0 was built on Ubuntu 18.04 by gitian build.\r\nThe response was confirmed using the sendrawtransaction command on the console. The variable with the following code is displayed in the response.\r\n```\r\nvalidation.cpp: L717\r\nif (nAbsurdFee && nFees> nAbsurdFee)\r\nreturn state.Invalid (ValidationInvalidReason :: TX_NOT_STANDARD, false,\r\nREJECT_HIGHFEE, \"absurdly-high-fee\",\r\nstrprintf (\"% d>% d\", nFees, nAbsurdFee));\r\n```\r\nIn the case of v0.18.0, the setting value of DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_MAXFEE or -maxtxfee was reflected in nAbsurdFee.\r\nHowever, in the case of v0.19.0, the value of \"v-size * x\" was reflected. I did not know what x was.\r\nHowever, the values ââreflected in nAbsurdFee are certainly different between v0.18.0 and v0.19.0. \r\nFor this reason, sendrawtransaction may fail in v0.19.0.",
