PLEASE REVIEW THAT PR FIRST.\r\n\r\nIf a CMPCTBLOCK is in flight from peer A and we then succesfully\r\nreconstruct it during CMPCTBLOCK processing from peer B, we need to\r\nclear the in-flight state for the block from peer A.\r\n\r\nWe can only do that once we've ensured that the block hasn't been\r\nmutated (otherwise peer B could interfere with our block relay from peer\r\nA by providing a mutated block).\r\n\r\nMutation-checking used to be done indirectly by checking that the block\r\nhad been writted to disk by checking the CBlockIndex. Now that\r\nProcessNewBlock returns a BlockValidationState, we can check that state\r\ndirectly to determine whether to mark the block as no longer in-flight.\r\n\r\nThis PR also renames `MarkBlockAsReceived()` to `MarkBlockAsNotInFlight()` since that function can be called when the block has not been received. It also improves the comments for `MarkBlockAsNotFlight()` and `MarkBlockAsNotInFlight()`",
