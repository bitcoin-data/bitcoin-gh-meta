   "body" : "The purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\r\n\r\n### Useful skills\r\n\r\n * Experience with autotools build systems\r\n\r\n### Task\r\n\r\nThe test utility library in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/src/test/util is currently only a folder and each module in there is compiled for each target that uses it. For example, `setup_common` is compiled 27 times (for the fuzz suite) and another 3 times for the other tests (bench, unit test, gui). To speed up the compilation and clarify build dependencies, this folder should be transformed into an actual library.\r\n\r\nBecause our test binaries should test as much as possible, this library may depend on any Bitcoin Core library or third party library (except boost-unit-test). It should be built when at least one target that requires it is built, skipped otherwise.\r\n\r\n### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this. You are encouraged to comment on the issue if you are planning to work on it. This will help other contributors monitor which issues are actively being addressed and is also an effective way to request assistance if and when you need it.\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",
