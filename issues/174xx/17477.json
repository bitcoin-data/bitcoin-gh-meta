   "body" : "These boost signals were added in #9371, before we had a `TransactionRemovedFromMempool` method in the validation interface. The `NotifyEntryAdded` callback was used by validation to build a vector of conflicted transactions when connecting a block, which the wallet was notified of in the `BlockConnected` CValidationInterface callback.\r\n\r\nNow that we have a `TransactionRemovedFromMempool` callback, we can fire that signal directly from the mempool for conflicted transactions.\r\n\r\nNote that #9371 was implemented to ensure `-walletnotify` events were fired for these conflicted transaction. We inadvertently stopped sending these notifications in #16624 (Sep 2019 commit 7e89994). We should probably fix that, but in a different PR.",
