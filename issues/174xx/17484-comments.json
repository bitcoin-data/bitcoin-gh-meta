Thoughts ?\r\n\r\nThe reason that you had to be out of IBD in order to set an HD seed is because by setting a new HD seed, no new keys would ever be generated from the old seed. So if there were a transaction that involved a key that hadn't been generated yet and was in a block after where you were currently synced, setting a new HD seed would mean that you don't detect that transaction. That would be bad.\r\n\r\nWith `createwallet`, the difference is that it's a completely new wallet with no history at all so it is safe to make a new wallet when you are behind.\r\n",

Any key that has already been derived and added to the wallet (i.e. it was in the keypool or already marked as used) will still be checked for. Setting a new seed doesn't change that. Setting a new seed only makes it so that no new keys will be derived from the old seed.\r\n\r\n> Node is getting out of IBD at tip N - DEFAULT_TIP_AGE(~144), which means you can set a new seed at N - 144, but you're not going to see a tx with an old key in block N - 100 for example, so is this mechanism reliable ?\r\n\r\nI think it's reasonably reliable as I think it is unlikely that someone used the entire keypool in 144 blocks.",

The payments to the keys handed out after the initial keypool was drained are lost.\r\n\r\n(1) must be an HD wallet because restoring a non-HD wallet backup that has drained its initial keypool keys always results in funds loss\r\n(3) must drain the initial keypool because setting a new HD seed does not remove the initial keypool from the wallet. It simply marks them as not in the keypool\r\n\r\nNot allowing `sethdseed` to be called before we're out of IBD isn't perfect protection against this. If many addresses (more than in the initial keypool) have been handed out, the user could still receive a payment to one of those addresses after they've changed their hdseed and lose the payment.\r\n\r\n@ariard - is it possible to change this so `m_is_ibd` initializes to `true` and then call `Chain::isInitialBlockDownload()` once on wallet start-up?",

Although I think it would be a fairly large change. We would need to keep track of the old hd seeds and keep track of where we've derived up to for a particular seed. And a bunch of things that do things on the seed would need to be changed to do things on any seed. We would have to add several more records to the wallet.\r\n\r\nAlternatively we could have `sethdseed` make a new `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` with the seed, but that may also require a bit of re-architecting as the primary assumption about `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`s will change. But we would have to wait for the full `ScriptPubKeyMan` and `CWallet` separation before that can happen.\r\n\r\n> and does descriptor wallets do that automatically?\r\n\r\nNot the current implementation.

Add a check there to see if the affected key has metadata associated with an inactive hd seed. If it does and the key number in the metadata is close enough to the highest generated key on that hd path, generate more keys on the path and add them to the wallet. I don't think this would require very much code. To work efficiently the `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` instance would need to have a new `map` from `KeyOriginInfo` hd path to the maximum generated key number on that path.\r\n\r\nActually, I think you would need to do what I just described even if you did want to instantiate different `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` instances for each seed, because inactive hd seeds aren't going to have any pool data, so `m_pool_key_to_index data` will be empty and existing topup code won't work for them. So you'd need this new `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan::MarkUnusedAddresses` code anyway.\r\n\r\nIf it is desirable to have separate `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` instances in the wallet, I think that might not be too hard to implement. The trickiest part would just be loading them. In `walletdb.cpp` as keys and scripts are loaded you would have to examine their metadata to figure out what seed they were associated with and load them into the appropriate keyman instance based on that seed.",
