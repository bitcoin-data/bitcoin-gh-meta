It seems premature to start any sort of refactoring in Bitcoin Core for BIP 179. It seems like it'll just disrupt other work / potentially break APIs while introducing new (also ambiguous given you can pick if you want to use Bitcoin or Address) terms into the code base that haven't seen any actual usage. Given that the BIP is < 1 month old, has there been any indication that these new terms are going to be adopted by other projects/companies?",

The term \"address\" has been in wide usage for well over five years which could mean it'll take five years or more of concerted effort to ensure people move away from using it. I am not convinced that the proponents of this BIP are willing to put in that concerted effort to ensure all educational resources and all businesses in the ecosystem change their terminology. I am also not convinced doing so is a good use of the proponents' time. IP \"addresses\" can be both static and dynamic. I don't see why Bitcoin addresses can't also be both static and dynamic. There are use cases where static Bitcoin addresses (at least in the short term) are more convenient than dynamic Bitcoin addresses e.g. posting a donation address that you have signed with your PGP key.",
