Of course, I am also linking against static boost (and other) libs and have a patched boost header set. If anyone cares there's a .xcodeproj for dogecoind, some precompiled static libs, and a script to patch the boost headers over in https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/tree/1.7-dev/contrib/macbuild \r\n\n\nÃ¢ÂÂ\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub. \t\t \t   \t\t  ",

Seems much more difficult than it should be. It's got 10s of 1000s of lines with no comments!\r\n\r\nAnyone ever thought of splitting this file into separate parts so it can be maintained? I'd expect to see either clearly marked test/configure sections or one main file importing the other parts, again with comments. \r\n\r\nAnyway, for now I'd appreciate any tips how to get this working quickly before I have to go and learn the whole autoconf and configure mechanisms. I get the point it's generating small \"main\" C++ files to test linkage. Pretty straightforward, but written in an extremely complex way (one large template file with one test running straight into the next).\r\n\r\nRather than a workaround, I'd like to know how can we correct it work on all systems with current boost libraries? The sleep function seems pretty simple to cause so much trouble. The other boost libraries (up to that point in configure) worked fine.",
