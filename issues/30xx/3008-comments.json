Secondly using up coin days is not just as good a method, because owning coins give you a steady supply of new coin days.\n\nIt's rather obnoxious that I could, for instance, create a timestamping app that made timestamps for free using whatever high-priority coins you had lying around using a bare/p2sh CHECKMULTISIG txout; individually timestamping every single Bitcoin git commit as they were created would only require a BTC or two.\n",

I updated the first commit with your suggestion, and added comments on two places in the code that can be simplified once the network upgrades.\n\n@petertodd : I think you're confused by the code that avoids creating a free transaction with a change output less than 0.01.  The edge case is a user who creates a high-priority transaction (maybe a 10 BTC, well-aged input) with a sub-CENT output (maybe they're sending 0.001 BTC, so have a 9.999 BTC change output) during the transition period when most of the network hasn't upgraded to 0.9 yet. The first version of this pull would send that without a fee, and their transaction would likely never confirm.\n",
