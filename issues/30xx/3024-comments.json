Replacement can be implemented in a zero-conf safe way if desired (albeit at the cost of occasionally failing due to a lack of txouts) and would make wallets and other software across the whole Bitcoin ecosystem more resilient to the replacement-related errors that we'd see anyway with memory limited mempools. (never mind people exploiting tx mutability, or CoinJoin, or a zillion other ways)\n",

Otherwise continue broadcasting the version we wanted mined.\n\nThe actual mempool replacement code I wrote awhile back: if at least one input conflicts, no new inputs are already spent, no output is already spent and new outputs are a superset of the old (txout value may be increased) replace the transaction.\n",

Any miner who is accepting out-of-band payment for transactions previously broadcast will seriously mess up the estimates, driving required fees/priority down and getting users' transactions stuck. (though oddly it seems that tx's with both positive fees and priority are ignored: https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/commit/61bd47fa9b495ef99df9c3b995ac067344981b88#L4R101 - this ignores data from wallets that don't do priority calculations, probably the majority of transactions)\n\nOne really ugly thing about the out-of-band payment case is by driving down apparent fees it wastes network bandwidth relaying transactions that as little as a single miner can profitably mine.\n\nNACK\n",

Until @gavinandresen wrote this, I don't think anyone was actively working on either problem. So this is definitely a step forward - someone just needs to get the other foot to move forward along with it.

When transactions don't go through for some reason it tends to be for other reasons (flaky network etc). However, a part of that reason is that we never generate free transactions. If we tried to do that, then transactions _would_ get stuck due to the entirely arbitrary 27kb limit.

In any case \"stuck\" is relative: if a transaction won't confirm for a few hours because everything else is paid more fees than me I'd very much call that stuck if I'm trying to buy some Bitcoins in person - that there is no way to set fees in the Android wallet is a complaint I've heard from people doing trades at the local Bitcoin meetup.\n\nHow do you feel zero-conf safe version of replacement breaks unconfirmed transactions?\n\n@gavinandresen Rather than trying to make this personal and putting words in my mouth, how about you just respond as to why you think this patch as it stands doesn't have cases where it will get people's transactions stuck due to bad fee estimation? If it does, how are you going to fix that before we merge it?\n\n@luke-jr I wouldn't say the current algorithms don't play nice with CPFP, rather I'd say they don't take advantage of it. The wallet doesn't re-spend unconfirmed transactions other than your own anyway, so the parent tx will always have what the wallet considers sufficient fees.\n",

As block space becomes scarce, the code in this pull request will give a BETTER estimate than the hard-coded rules we have now.\n\nAnybody who commented above: please let me know if I missed some subtle interaction that makes you think that this pull request will be worse than the code in the tree before this pull request.\n",

If you make the fee estimation have a fixed lower bound then you'd have a system that's strictly better than the current one.\n\nAnyway right now there is the opposite problem: I've been testing the code on one of my nodes and right now estimatefees calculates the 1% cut-off used for relaying to be 0.23mBTC/KB, lower than the 0.1mBTC/KB hardcoded default. At initial startup after upgrading or if the mempool data is wiped for any reason estimateFees falls back to the hardcoded values until the estimates get enough data, which would mean that transactions created by the user in that time-frame would have fees so low they wouldn't even get into the mempool and thus would get stuck.\n\nAnyway without the ability to actually change the fee on a transaction after the fact we're always going to run into cases like that - what's your plan to fix this?\n",

The Right Thing is complicated, though-- for example, if the wallet is locked then the wallet code can't just create a higher-fee version of the transaction and try again.  What do you suggest?\n",

Once that's done we can consider merging.\n\nLong term as I said before we need to have the ability to increase the fees on a transaction after the fact - replace-by-fee does that efficiently, and replace-by-fee+txouts are a strict superset maintains the current zero-conf behavior.\n\nSure, the right thing is a bit complicated, but start moving in that direction now - replacement will break all kinds of really badly written merchant code, but the longer we wait the more of that code will get written. (e.g. BIP70 doesn't make it clear as I suggested before that a payment should be considered valid if a given scriptPubKey:value pair exists, so people will write code that assumes a given txid)\n\nre: txrejected, thoughts on tx propagation proofs? http://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg02868.html\n",
