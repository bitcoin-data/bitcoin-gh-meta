   "body" : "Feelers are short-lived connections used to test the viability of peers. The bitcoind node will periodically open feeler connections to addresses in its addrman, wait for a `version` message from the peer, and then close the connection.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we set `fRelay` to `1` in the `version` message for feeler connections, indicating that we want the peer to relay transactions to us. However, we close the connection immediately on receipt of the `version` message, and so never process any incoming transaction announcements. This PR changes that behaviour to instead set `fRelay` to `0` indicating that we do not wish to receive transaction announcements from the peer.\r\n\r\nThis PR also extends the `addconnection` RPC to allow creating outbound feeler connections from the node to the test framework, and a test to verify that the node sets `fRelay` to `0` in the `version` message to feeler connections.",
