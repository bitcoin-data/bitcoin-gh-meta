This seems pretty unsustainable unless we at least make changes in regards to the fuzz inputs being used by the different branches. I'm pretty sure Marco has mentioned this before.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes CI ignore fuzz tests by forcing `RUN_FUZZ_TESTS=false` for all cases when it is not the master branch or a PR based on it.\r\n\r\nSee #22731 as a demo for the 22.x branch.",
