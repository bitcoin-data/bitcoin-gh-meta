   "body" : "If `combinerawtransaction` is given a transaction containing completed taproot spends, it will drop the signatures from those inputs. For 0.21, `combinerawtransaction` would actually cause an assertion failure - this was fixed by #21330. This is not a regression as `combinerawtransaction` never worked with txs with taproot inputs anyways. AFAICT, either taproot was not yet implemented, it hit an assertion, or it is broken.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I don't think this is particularly important to fix since the recommended workflow is to use PSBTs. But I am opening this issue to document this in case someone does come across this bug.\r\n\r\nOriginally found by @roconnor-blockstream ",
