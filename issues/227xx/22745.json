CPU Temperature is low (62Â°C) and it used at 2%. My memory is used at 22% (I run other software on my PC).\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\nNothing, I just would the software works. I would the node doesn't stuck.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nA low opacity applicated in all bitcoin core Qt (When a software doesn't respond). My mouse is loading. I can't do anything. Except close the software.\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\nIdk, seriously it's realy strange...\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\nOpen the bitcoin core, and wait a connection to a pool is done (Wait when the state is \"Synchronizing...\").\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nI'm using the Bitcoin Core version v0.21.1. I downloaded the software on this page for my OS (64bits) : https://bitcoin.org/en/download (windows). \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nI'm using Windows 10 Pro (64bits). I've a Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-10900K CPU @ 3.70GHz   3.70 GHz and 32 Go RAM (recently bought 2 months ago). For the disk, I've put the blockchain and all files onto my HDD 4 To (SEGATE) disk.\r\n\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue? What is your operating system and its version? If Linux, what is your desktop environment and graphical shell? -->\r\nIt's a Bitcoin's GUI problem. It doesn't repond. I've the latest windows 10 version.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n//\r\n\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/HjjvdxuY (EXPIRATION IN 1 WEEK).\r\n",
