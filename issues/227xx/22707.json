   "body" : "I don't think this changes the intention of the test. But it does shave ~30 seconds off the time it takes to run. From what I've seen our CI `macOS 11 native [gui] [no depends]` runs `mempool_updatefrom.py` in ~135 seconds. After this PR it should run in ~105 seconds\r\n\r\nI noticed this improvement should probably be made when testing performance/runtimes of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22698. But I wanted to separate this out from that PR so the affects of each is decoupled\r\n\r\nEdit: The major change in this PR is improving mempool_updatefrom.py's runtime as this is a very long running test. Then made the same efficiency improvements across all the functional tests as it made since to do that here",
