   "body" : "block-relay-only connections are additional outbound connections that bitcoind makes since v0.19. They participate in block relay, but do not propagate transactions or addresses. They were introduced in #15759.\r\n\r\nWhen creating an outbound block-relay-only connection, since we know that we're never going to announce transactions over that connection, we can save on memory usage by not a `TxRelay` data structure for that connection. When receiving an inbound connection, we don't know whether the connection was opened by the peer as block-relay-only or not, and therefore we always construct a `TxRelay` data structure for inbound connections.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible to tell whether an inbound connection will ever request that we start announcing transactions to it. The `fRelay` field in the `version` message may be set to `0` to indicate that the peer does not wish to receive transaction announcements. The peer may later request that we start announcing transactions to it by sending a `filterload` or `filterclear` message, **but only if we have offered `NODE_BLOOM` services to that peer**. `NODE_BLOOM` services are disabled by default, and it has been recommended for some time that users not enable `NODE_BLOOM` services on public connections, for privacy and anti-DoS reasons.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we have not offered `NODE_BLOOM` to the peer _and_ it has set `fRelay` to `0`, then we know that it will never request transaction announcements, and that we can save resources by not initializing the `TxRelay` data structure.",
