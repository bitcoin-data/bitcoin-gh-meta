   "body" : "Hello, I hava only one pc and I make the bitcoin in wsl on my pc.\r\nI just want to create multiple bitcoin nodes in my pc. I have read [this](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/52267/connecting-two-local-nodes-in-regtest?r=SearchResults,) but failed too.\r\nSo would you please tell me how to solve it? thank you.\r\n\r\nI am so sorry maybe I mislead you above  . Actually, my aim is to create a private chain with multiple bitcoin nodes which can connect themselves in WSL on my only one PC. When one of these nodes mine a  block and this guy  can broadcast it to other nodes  then other nodes begin to try to mine next block on my PC and this is my aim. \r\nBy the way, the WSL is Windows Subsystem for Linux.\r\nHence, would you please tell me how to solve it? thank you.",
