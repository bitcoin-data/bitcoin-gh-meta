      "body" : "None of this is related to Bitcoin Core but, I hope that you will allow me to indulge.\r\n\r\nThere are several proposals in existence, improvements that would each wholly/partly resolve the speed/reliability/fee issues. What is needed are analysts to determine specifications, programmers to code and, testers to verify operations. Nothing happens until specifications are determined, and the process is slow. Also, there is perceived great resistance to hard-fork scenarios, but let us hope not when they are beneficial and necessary.\r\n\r\nThe ability to send micropayments is a part of the utility value of bitcoin. I do not see that it is necessary to lower the average fee, indeed the highest fees may yet increase, but it is necessary that it is possible also to send small payments with a small fee reliably.\r\n\r\nIn fact, lowering the average fee may in the long-run be detrimental to Bitcoin, it is just necessary for the service to retain its utility value.\r\n\r\nI would welcome your feedback on one of the many proposals, the one that I have been working on \"[UTPFOTIB](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-January/015492.html)\" - there is still some work to do before that proposal is formalised.",
