Applications are stored in the non-user space while the library is in the user space.\r\n\r\n> Another approach is to put an uninstall button inside QT, somewhere in the settings. This would work for Linux as well. In Windows it would just launch the standalone uninstaller. The uninstall button would have a check box.\r\n\r\nHmm.. pretty uncommon for macOS applications.\r\n\r\nIIRC, OSX does now auto-detect related data files when you delete an application. Someone should look up the apple developer docs what recommendation are made there.",

This is because in case the user decides to put it back in (if they deleted by mistake) , stuff works \"as expected\". The uninstall button sounds like a nice option, and users can choose to keep the chain in case they decide to install again.",
