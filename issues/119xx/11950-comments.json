      "body" : "Regarding `BitcoinAmountField` we could create a [custom widget plugin](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtdesigner-customwidgetplugin-example.html) to encapsulate its UI subelements (amount field + spinbox + currency dropdown) and functionality. If I understand correctly, the interface builder can then use that widget and show you a preview that's more like the real thing. That's not trivial. Turns out, fortunately, it's not urgent either!\r\n\r\nHaving studied `BitcoinAmountField` a bit more, it turns out this class isn't messing with the UI as much as I initially thought (and the top most screenshot is something else). Although the code adds a Spinbox (to increase and decrease the amount) and a ComboBox (to select the currency), they are added inside of the space allocated to BitcoinAmountField by interface builder, not next to it. So interface builder still works, I was just using it wrong.\r\n\r\nEmbedding amount in a QHBoxLayout and putting a horizontal spacer on the right side of the check box did the trick:\r\n<img width=\"749\" alt=\"schermafbeelding 2017-12-19 om 20 58 48\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/34176215-6ff6a030-e4ff-11e7-8283-82d79c931cf6.png\">",
