   "body" : "Hello I have question how it looks with lowering fees at the moment the fees are extreme 30-40% per transaction the confirmation time is 9-12hours some transactions are unconfirmed 2 weeks.\r\nMicropayments impossible company temporary closed support for bitcoin payment due to high fees and confirmation time.\r\nIs there any plan to implement the lightning network or reduce block time for 2 minute with rewards for miners 1.2 BTG. Or increase the block size for 8MB.\r\nOfficial Bitcoin Core page is not giving out any information's how this would be solved. Competition fork already have low fees lightning network. Even the bitpay offering payment with fork bitcoin.\r\nThis is a serious issue as i see everyday people that bought Bitcoin at november regret that step because of the fees, small mining farms already switch to fork bitcoin, because of extreme Bitcoin transaction fees and others think about it. Thank you for your answer",
