For example most math functions in C have arguments as double while in C++ the arguments are both floats and double and long double.\r\n\r\nI actually ended up doing this while I've seen a warning in some log10 usage saying that float was used and extended to double or something along the lines. Not a big deal though.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of using C++ headers is that names in the standard library are quite common and when you don't use namespaces you might shot yourself in the foot.\r\n\r\nAnd contrary to comments in the pull #11261 you don't need to specify the namespace for the integer types, that would be just overkill.\r\n\r\nOf course it's not a priority but as I was looking at the code I just picked some low hanging fruits.
