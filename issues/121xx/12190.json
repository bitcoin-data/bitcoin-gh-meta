Unfortunately I got only one feedback, saying I should give it a go on github and pointing out that the bitcoin-dev mailing list ist for protocol discussions. For completeness, I paste the content of my original mail here:\r\n\r\n> Hey there\r\n> Most source files contain the \"default\" copyright-header (also build by a\r\n> script in devtools/copyright_header.py), which points out that the MIT\r\n> license can be found in the COPYING file or at\r\n> http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php.\r\n> \r\n> However, the provided link is 1) using http where it could use https, 2)\r\n> resulting in a redirect (https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\r\n> anyway.\r\n> I am strongly in favor of using https where possible (I guess there are\r\n> many other non-ssl links in the code base, but lets tackle the easier ones\r\n> first).\r\n> \r\n> I propose that I\r\n> 1) create a issue on github,\r\n> 2) `sed -i` the relevant links,\r\n> 3) create a PR on github,\r\n> 4) come back to the mailing list.\r\n> \r\n> This change would affect a few hundred files I guess.\r\n> \r\n> A question remaining is this change would require a\r\n> copyright-year-extension (to 2018), too.\r\n> \r\n> An example header can be seen e.g. here\r\n> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a9a49e6e7e8df13d80a6dc3245ce7ef041942e9b/src/consensus/merkle.cpp#L3\r\n> \r\n> I'd be happy about quick feedback - do not know the culture here, yet.\r\n> \r\n> Have fun\r\n> Felix",
