It didn't add anything new to the privacy conversation, that wasn't already known. I agree, that it was misleading, because 1. it was conducted by a well-known company and 2. they used a language that implies they came up with new, previously unknown things. I've even heard someone having the takeaway from it, that \"Bitfury invented clustering\".  \r\nFor a better quality research on the same topic, see the paper: [When the cookie meets the blockchain: Privacy risks of web payments via cryptocurrencies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04748.pdf).\r\n\r\nWith that said , what was especially worrisome about it, is that Bitfury actually plans to utilize the methods. However they don't have an edge on present day Blockchain analysis companies, because they may don't write research on their methods, they know all the basic things the Bitfury paper talks about, and they have already been collecting various metadata (like Bloom filters) for years now.  \r\n\r\nIn the end, it all comes down to sales. Having home grown research papers gives Bitfury credibility and opportunities, so they claim their expertise on a specific domain.  ",
