The sort-by-feerate is imo desirable , if not essential.  I don't think we should get rid of either behavior.\r\n\r\nHowever I think we can get rid of `CompareTxMemPoolEntryByScore` after #12118, and replace its only remaining uses with the ancestor feerate comparison (that's the only remaining change I had left at the moment), once that's fixed to be the min(feerate, feerate_with_ancestors).  I was going to PR that separately after these were merged.\r\n\r\nIf reviewers would rather see all these changes in one PR, I can do that too (I thought smaller would be better here).",
