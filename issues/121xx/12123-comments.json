Finding the correct value for this is another story but I think we could save some CPU cycles by considering a number > 64 at least.\r\n\r\nLeveldb's paranoid flag is turned on also meaning that we do a CRC checksum on opening tables (files). 7% of collected samples include this. The number falls off as we require less file opens.\r\n\r\nI hope someone can comment on this research and any maybe run similar numbers on a Linux machine.",

      "body" : "I have been looking at this independently. I believe that the frequent close/munmap calls is causing the kernel to make poor decisions about page cache management during IBD/reindexing, which is what I'm trying to fix.\r\n\r\nThere's a trick to make this work safely on Linux (maybe other POSIX systems as well?):\r\n * If you close a file descriptor that is associated with a mmap mapping, the mapping **remains valid and does not count against your file descriptor limit**\r\n * The default mmap limit on Linux (`sysctl vm.max_map_count`) is 64k, which is huge and way more than we need (currently the chainstate database has about 1500 files in it on mainnet)\r\n * The only overhead of doing this is the extra page table entries, which uses a negligible amount of extra memory\r\n\r\nThis means that the code can be reworked to have **all** chainstate LevelDB files mmaped (for reads at least) simultaneously, without adversely affecting performance or using a lot of file descriptors. However, it does require some surgery to LevelDB internals. In concept the change sounds minimal but I have to do some actual hacking on the LevelDB code to see what the diff actually looks like when it's fully implemented. I plan to work on this and present the changes for discussion if it ends up being sufficiently minimal/self contained.",
