Is that the expected behaviour? Ideally, it should add any newly received transactions to the dump in that case. Probably outside the scope of your fix.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that on my not particularly low spec system running Fedora, loading mempool takes over 1 hour when the node is started so, it is a long process on some systems, it is possible to receive lots of new transactions if the node is restarted again in that time.",
