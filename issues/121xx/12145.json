The symlinks required for that are a bit obscene from a maintenance perspective, so I'd like you to reorganize the subdirectories of Bitcoin to unnest the more frequently accessed files directories from the less frequently accessed larger things, i.e., either move blocks/index into index (e.g., ~/.bitcoin/index rather than ~/.bitcoin/blocks/index), or move blocks/\\*.\\* into a new subdirectory blocks/data and you can leave blocks/index where it is.  \r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n\r\nLess difficulty managing apportionment of large subdirectories and frequently accessed files onto different speed disks\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\nA canonical root-based symlink was required, which can offer difficulties in maintenance in the future.\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\nOh gosh.  Must you with the extra unnecessary questions?\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\ngit as of January 11, 2018.  (git has no manual, so I have no idea which version control system version number.)\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\nPresumably platform independent, but Mac.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n\r\nP.S., did you know \\* is only able to be typed in this Github post with the text \\\\\\*?",
