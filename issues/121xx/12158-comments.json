      "body" : "@practicalswift Yes I used Bear with verbose make output.\r\n\r\nBear doesn't work with bitcoin by default since the buildsystem makes use of libtool. Given I'm a CMake guy, I couldn't figure out how to get around that so what I did was I hacked Bear.\r\n\r\nBasically I added the following line to /usr//bin/bear. \r\n\r\n250         re.compile(r'^libtool: compile :  clang(\\+\\+)?(-\\d+(\\.\\d+){0,2})?$'),\r\n\r\nAnd of course ran ./configure with CC=\"clang\"\r\nAnd bear make V=1\r\n\r\nHope that helps. Ideally this would be integrated in the buildsystem, CMake already provides support for compilation databases.\r\n\r\nI also tried to just pass CC=clang-tidy at configure time but that fails since IIRC in univalue the configure step tries to compile something to see if there's support and that messes everything up. Again CMake guy.",
