Most of the time it goes through the update startup rocess oke and then wehen it starts loading it get's stuck.\r\nI looked in the error.log and this is what it says something like:\r\n2018-01-12 12:08:05 LevelDB read failure: IO error: E:\\BT\\chainstate\\101461.ldb: Can't execute because of an error in I/O-device.\r\n\r\n\r\n2018-01-12 12:08:05 IO error: E:\\BT\\chainstate\\101461.ldb: Can't execute because of an error in I/O-device.\r\n\r\nI have the bitcoin folder on external harddrive. It worked fine a couple of weeks ago when I went to update after a couple of months of not connecting. Everything was updated fine and working properly. Then  I wanted to do a little test and opend an online account on Blockchain and transfered a minimal amount as a test. Test went fine but after that I was no longer able to open my Bitcoin Core wallet because of above descibed error.\r\n\r\nCan anybody help?\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n",
