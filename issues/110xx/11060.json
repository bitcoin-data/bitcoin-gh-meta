   "body" : "With the recent state of the mempool I have some transactions that have been stuck in the memory pool for about a week due to low fees. The memory pool is not anywhere close to being full, but there is a continuous stream of higher fee transactions in the pool. Abandon transaction is not available because the transactions are in my local memory pool (they are unlikely to be evicted from the memory pool anytime soon).\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if abandontransaction was enhanced to allow abandoning of in-wallet and in-mempool transactions if they have not been confirmed in for X blocks (where X > 72 hours). It would have to delete the abandoned transaction from the local memory pool in this case.\r\n\r\nAdditional comments:\r\nYes, one option is to use zapwallettxes. But it seems like zapwallettxes is way to big of a hammer to deal with this problem, all I really want to do is remove my unconfirmed transactions from my wallet and my local memory pool and then just wait for them to fall out of the global memory pool. Also, using zapwalletxes requires restarting the node.\r\n\r\nI did not have RBF enabled when I initially created the transactions, so RBF will not fix the problem.\r\n\r\nIn this case, CPFP (child pays for parent) is an option, but it was unclear if/how well supported this is by the miners and if not, it would only make the problem worse.",
