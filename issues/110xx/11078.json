It appeared to me that the previous p2p connections had not been fully disconnected before attempting to add new p2p connections.\r\n\r\nI've added a sleep and restarted the NetworkThread, but I don't know whether this will fix the problem, since I'm unable to reproduce the failure locally.\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke - not sure what you want to do here? I don't think this change could make things any worse.",
