This causes awkward behavior from the \"custom change\" feature, for sure-- but my advice there would be to not use that. :)\r\n\r\nTo understand why send to self are not hidden unless they're change pool keys imagine a service with multiple users where users can direct sends and get deposits.  If one user withdraws to another users address and it were treated as change, funds would vanish.\r\n\r\nOne could argue that the custom change thing could annotate the transaction with an exception of some kind... but it wouldn't be durable across recovery and would add a lot of complexity, thus the \"don't use that\" recommendation. \r\n\r\nOh, and some extra color as to why the BIP125 flag works like that:  It's pedantically true (BIP125 doesn't allow replacing a confirmed transaction)  but mostly we were concerned that some merchants might ignore payments which were BIP125 replaceable .... even after they were long confirmed and hoped that switching to no would reduce how often that particular error was made.",
