   "body" : "According to the NYA, 90% of the hashing power will be diverted to segwit2x coin. This will slow the chain to almost a complete stop. Considering the hostility of Core towards the miners, there is a thin chance that bitcoin will get any more than 10% of the current hashing power, and there is a high chance that the network will be exposed to 51% attacks. Since Core has criticized segwit2x coin for forking off, how is core going to protect bitcoin without the need of a hard fork? Is an adjustment like bitcoin-abc did required or the newly created altcoin (corecoin) needs a different pow algo?",
