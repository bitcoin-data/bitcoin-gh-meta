It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (you can find the patches applied at test-time at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/files/patches/)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n\nThis test script verifies pulls every time they are updated.

      "body" : "So, some more thoughts. The generic problem this pullreq tries to solve is very worthwhile: right now, we have the full blocks stored and indexed, but retrieving anything more than the headers and the txids in them is not possible without txindex=1. This shouldn't be necessary - just a sequential scan through the blocks is perfectly meaningful.\n\nI'm still unconvinced about the implementation though. Doing such a sequential scan using this code here results in every block being read from disk and parsed N times, with N the number of transactions in it - only to fetch a single one from it. I have some suggestions for alternatives, but neither is perfect imho either:\n- Add a mode to getblock to inline the full transactions (efficient, but huge RPC replies, and unable to filter transactions you don't care about)\n- Add a mode to getblock which adds opaque transaction pointers to the output (e.g. block file number + position + size encoded in some form, or block hash + offset, or even just txids itself). The client isn't supposed to interpret these transaction pointers in any way, but pass them on to getrawtransaction. Ugly, but efficient and flexible.\n- Cache the last block read through getblock, so getrawtransaction (which takes the block hash, as implemented here) can just scan through it. Nice solution, but what if access isn't entirely sequential?\n- Cache the positions of transactions of the last few blocks read through getblock, so they can be read directly. Not a trivial change anymore though, ...\n",
