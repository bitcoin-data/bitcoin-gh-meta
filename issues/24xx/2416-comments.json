On my _single-core_ MIPS system, there should be no problems WRT memory ordering when accessing the same 4-byte quantity from different threads.  The only problem could be GCC introducing memory ordering issues due to read/write reordering on code optimization.  But compiling with -Os should have removed any such issues for class AtomicPointer (by keeping all accesses cleanly in non-inlined functions).  \n\nNote that compiliation is already setting -DLEVELDB_CSTDATOMIC_PRESENT, how likely is it that <cstdatomic> is broken on MIPS? \n\nStill, going to run some more tests...\n",

The proper implementation for those newer multi-core MIPSes (Loongson 3A, Octeon etc.) should be :\n\n  **asm** volatile (\"sync\" : : : \"memory\");\n\nThis version is curently running here, though on a single-core system there shouldn't be any perceivable difference.\n\nTo make the implementation somewhat portable across Linux distributions, we might have to change that into:\n\n  **asm** volatile (\".int 0x0f\" : : : \"memory\");\n\nThis generates the same code, but doesn't rely on GNU As to parse the 'sync' mnemonic.  GNU As will only allow sync opcode assembly when MIPS III or newer architecture was specified via GCC march= switch.  However on Debian Mips, default settings compile for Mips1 only, to support all the older gear.\n\nNow on old Mips1 CPUs, leveldb would SIGILL at runtime, but then those old CPUs may not be capable to keep up with the Bitcoin network's load anyways.  All recently manufactured MIPS CPUs/SoCs I know of support at least the MIPS III instructions (most should do MIPS32r2, Loongson 2f is very backwards in only supporting MIPS III, but that's due to patents).\n\nA proper patch would look like this:\n\n``` diff\nIndex: bitcoin-0.8.5-linux/src/src/leveldb/port/atomic_pointer.h\n===================================================================\n--- bitcoin-0.8.5-linux.orig/src/src/leveldb/port/atomic_pointer.h      2013-09-12 12:43:31.000000000 +0200\n+++ bitcoin-0.8.5-linux/src/src/leveldb/port/atomic_pointer.h   2013-09-18 04:24:17.358004348 +0200\n@@ -68,6 +68,18 @@\n }\n #define LEVELDB_HAVE_MEMORY_BARRIER\n\n+// Gcc on MIPS\n+#elif defined(__mips) && defined(__GNUC__)\n+inline void MemoryBarrier() {\n+   /* Actually a 'sync' instruction, though that can only be assembled\n+      with the right -march= switch present, so compilation would fail with\n+      default GCC options on Debian-Mipsel (which compiles for Mips1 per\n+      default) */\n+  __asm__ __volatile__(\".int 0x0000000f\" : : : \"memory\");\n+}\n+#warning \"Mips detected\"\n+#define LEVELDB_HAVE_MEMORY_BARRIER\n+\n // Mac OS\n #elif defined(OS_MACOSX)\n inline void MemoryBarrier() {\n```\n",
