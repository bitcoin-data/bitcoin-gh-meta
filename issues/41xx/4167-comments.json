Armory: no separators to the right of the decimal point (don't know about to the left as it doesn't support units smaller than bitcoin yet).\n\nReally, most people probably don't complain about lack of thousands separators to the right of the decimal because most people don't know they exist (although how you're supposed to distinguish 0.00001 from 0.000001 without them is beyond me).  We don't have that problem yet, but I see people confuse 0.001 and 0.0001 often enough.  Maybe this is just more fuel for the argument for a units change though.\n\nBut if the community really does move to 'bits' then people are going to complain about the lack of them to the _left_ of the decimal.  Lots of people will have millions of bits, and knowing whether they have 10000000 bits or 1000000 bits or 100000 bits without having to count the zeros is important.\n",

      "body" : "drak: I'm not a scientist, I'm a Linux sysadmin (although I did study physical sciences to university level).\n\nI really think the comparison with fiat currency (like accounting software or ATMs) is misguided because:\n- Fiat currency pretty much invariably works either in whole numbers or with exactly two decimal places.  This pretty much avoids the ambiguity, and also avoids the requirement for grouping to the right of the decimal point\n- With the exception of the Eurozone, fiat currency is largely country-specific anyway.  If I'm trying to send fiat to someone in another country or am requesting fiat payment from someone in another country then whether we write dots or commas really is the least of our problems\n\nAs for exchanging accounts, spreadsheets or other financial documents across international borders, this isn't something the general public does -- and accounting professionals  who work in this area will be used to the issues.\n\nWe're not special flowers here; the requirement to be able to accurately and precisely communicate numerical values across international boundaries -- where those values might be very large or very small, and might contain a large number of significant digits -- is not new to Bitcoin.  Smart people have already thought about this problem and solved it decades ago.  But if the Bitcoin community wants to reinvent the wheel, be my guest.\n\nI watch with some bemusement the reactions to suggesting we use this standard and widely adopted convention -- but I'm particularly interested in the reaction to grouping the digits to the right of the decimal point, which has ranged from surprise to active hostility.  What this really proves to me is that, even amongst a highly technical set of users, most people _really_ aren't used to dealing with numbers with more than a couple of digits to the right of the decimal point on a day-to-day basis.  More than anything, this convinces me that ÂµBTC is the only way to go.  (And I say this as someone who started out not that long ago as a units change skeptic.)\n",

Do you know where this is documented?\n\nEDIT: Actually, I think it is the single hanging digits that kept looking wrong to me.  Part of why I kept trying to reduce the space width, I think, as I mistook the reason it looked wrong\n\nEDIT: It appears this book does the same to the left of the decimal point.  It writes '1000' without a thousands separator, but writes '10 000' with one.\n",

Neither dots nor commas are inserted in the spaces between groups of three. However, when there are only four digits before or after the decimal marker, it is customary not to use a space to isolate a single digit.\"\n\nSo you're right. It's 1000, but 10 000 and 1 000 000. Similarly 0.0001 but 0.000 01 and 0.000 000 1.\n",

(Well, boring at least in the sense that we don't have any particularly exotic number formatting conventions.)\n\nI'm interested because those in en_GB or en_US saying \"use locale-specific number formatting\" counts for little since it won't have much impact on us.  I'd like to here what people living in _different_ locales want -- particularly people living in locales (such as de_DE) that use dot as the preferred thousands separator.\n\nI don't know, but strongly suspect, that people in de_DE (German German) have to contend with a mishmash of localized and non-localized software.  So that \"1.000\" _might_ mean \"one thousand\" from a localized app, or it _might_ mean \"exactly one\" from a non-localized app (that always uses a dot as the decimal point, regardless of locale).\n\nCase in point, Bitcoin Core is currently exactly such an app that always used dot, regardless of locale.\n\nSo it's not at all clear to me that de_DE residents will even thank us for switching from the current \"1000\" to a localized \"1.000\", since the latter probably can't be correctly interpretted without context.\n\nBut I'd love to know what people in those locales really think.\n",

This would mess up digit alignment in tabular data -- and it would also make it much harder to line up the decimal points.\n\nFortunately, looking at actual real life data, people don't actually like printing tables that look horribly misaligned.  I found two ways in which this was tackled in real life tabular data to the right of the decimal point (presumably the same approaches can be used to the left).\n- In a table where most values had four decimal places, but the odd one had five, they simply suspended the use of thin spaces\n\n```\n0.99955\n0.9956\n0.9812\n0.9703\n0.9672\n0.9721\n```\n- In a table where there were lots of numbers with five decimal places, but the odd one with four, they simply suspended the rule special casing four digits:\n\n```\n1.747 56\n1.772 67\n1.638 05\n1.641 32\n2.519 39\n2.408\n2.221 24\n4.171 9\n```\n\nSo it seems that we can be pragmatic and do what makes sense given the nature of the data.

But indeed, it makes sense to simply group per three, at least in the overview page and transaction overview, as having the numbers below each other align up is more important here. It's also easier for people to learn this (for many) new convention of grouping digits after the dot if done consistently per three.\n\nTo be honest I'm still a bit divided on the whole concept of grouping digits after the dot. Maybe people that want that should just switch to mBTC/muBTC to get the long slew of digits before the dot. But it might grow on me...\n",
