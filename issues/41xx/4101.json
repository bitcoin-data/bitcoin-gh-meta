   "body" : "Adds a \"Restart\" option to the file and tray menu.\n\n![restart](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2814559/2813049/5f1c8300-ce7a-11e3-8662-2dd2eedf6368.png)\n\nI downloaded the icon somewhere where it says it is under the LGPL license.\n\nIf an options change requires a restart, a popup appears.\n\n![restart1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2814559/2813053/64045df2-ce7a-11e3-95dd-10a4c3ba29ea.png)\n\nAlso encryptwallet can now restart.\n\nCommand line options will be passed accordingly to the new process, except rescan,reindex etc. \n\nThe parent process creates a new child process and exits. This causes the child process to inherit\nthe open file descriptors. (Only for *nixes.) So I had to add some \"fcntl\" to prevent file descriptor leaks.\nThere could still be some leaked, for example on my system with qt5, leaked descriptors for \"/dev/ati/card0\"\nget added every restart. But we dynamically raise file descriptor limit and exit if not enough available.\nOn my system the max limit is a million by default, so I doubt that this will cause a problem to anybody, and even if, we would just exit with \"Not enough file descriptors available.\"\n\nWindows does not have this issue, because there is a flag for this and QProcess::startDetached calls CreateProcess() with bInheritHandles=false.\nI checked the qt source code and tested this with process explorer on windows, and indeed, no handle leftovers there.\n\nTested\n- Linux (qt4.8, qt5.2)\n- Windows 7 64bit qt5.2 (32 and 64 bit executables)\n",
