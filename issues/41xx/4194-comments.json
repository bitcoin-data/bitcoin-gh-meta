It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n\nThis test script verifies pulls every time they are updated. It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.  If you are waiting on a test, please check timestamps to verify that the test.log is moving at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/current/\nContact BlueMatt on freenode if something looks broken.\n",

It would be a larger change that would need a refactoring of the option system.\n\nCurrently the complete list of options, let alone how their values are to be parsed, is not specified in advance. A possible design would be to use some table-based structure like CRPCCommand in `rpcserver.cpp`, with 'actors' that parse/verify the values. The GUI, CLI and daemon then register their own lists of options before the parsing starts.\n\nThere are quite some challenges though;\n- Handling option defaults is non-trivial. Some option settings affect other options defaults (in AppInit2).\n- For the GUI there is a third options source: the QSettings. Both command line options and bitcoind.conf options take precedence over this.\n- `-conf`, `-datadir`, `-testnet`/`-regtest` are difficult to handle properly (as it is possible to specify datadir= in the config file, as well as testnet, which changes the datadir which is respectively cached...), there have been many commits in the past reverting unwanted behavior after changes to argument handling: c61fe44, c52c4e5 (pull #3935, #3844)\n\nIt would be best to make a test framework first, so we can be more sure that there are no regressions.\n",

SetDefault does nothing in case the option is already explicitly set (perhaps by a previous SetDefault).\n- There's a lookup function that finds options with arbitrary names at runtime, by looking them up in the table.\n\nThis means you can replace existing definitions like\n\n```\nint nTransactionFee = DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_FEE;\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nCIntOption nTransactionFee(\"paytxfee\", DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_FEE, \"The relay fee used, blah blah\")\n```\n\nThe startup sequence can just be:\n- Iterate over command-line options, look the options up, and apply SetDefault to them.\n- Open the config file (whose location may have been influenced by the command-line options), look them up, and apply SetDefault to them.\n- Run custom logic for defaults, looking values of some options, and use it to set defaults for others (assuming they haven't been set yet).\n\nI believe this should be safe, as the explicit set/default flag in each option instance corresponds to the current logic associated with an option being present in mapArgs/mapMultiArgs, and the overriding of defaults would work similarly.\n",
