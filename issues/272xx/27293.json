I think it is relatively clear that the dataset adds value to Bitcoin as an information technology by provided data for research and development. However, the PR was flagged as spam and comments were blocked. \r\n\r\nIf there is a valid reason for why the PR was rejected, I think that is fine. However, the PR was certainly not spam.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nI expected the PR to merged.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI am not sure there is a way to reproduce the bug because it is on the maintainers Bitcoin Core. I am not sure whether there is an automated system that created this bug or whether it is the product of human error. @andrewchow\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nBitcoin Core\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nMac\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
