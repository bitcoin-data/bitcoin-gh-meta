   "body" : "This is a first step towards closing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3314 by implementing functions in Wallet and ScriptPubKeyMan that determine if a key is \"still in the keypool\" aka \"fresh\". This wording and the function names may need some brainstorming because the concept of \"used\" keys already has a few meanings, especially the `avoid_reuse` flag.\r\n\r\nA key is \"still in the keypool\" or \"fresh\" if:\r\n- it has never been seen on chain\r\n- its index does not precede any keys seen on chain\r\n- it has never rested unencrypted on disk\r\n\r\nFollow-up work will be adding UI to this both in RPC `getaddressinfo` and the GUI address book.\r\n\r\nThis PR also patches a bug (?) from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22051 where matching public keys were not returned from raw P2PK descriptors.",
