   "body" : "This is a first step towards closing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3314 by implementing functions in Wallet and ScriptPubKeyMan that determine if a key is \"active\" meaning \"derived from a currently active scriptpubkey manager.\" \r\n\r\nA key is NOT \"active\" if:\r\n- It was imported using an `import{privkey, address, pubkey}` rpc\r\n- It was derived before the wallet was encrypted (which replaces the active SPKM(s))\r\n\r\nUsers should be discouraged from using these keys to receive new transactions, so this PR adds a new field `isactive` to rpc `getaddressinfo`, follow-up work will be adding this to the GUI address book as well, [something like this](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3314#issuecomment-81567665). The original issue also recommends sweeping all value from keys in this category, I think that feature can be discussed in the future as a follow-up.\r\n\r\nThis PR also patches `PKDescriptor` from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22051 where matching public keys were not returned.\r\n\r\nFollow-up PR for the GUI: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/723",
