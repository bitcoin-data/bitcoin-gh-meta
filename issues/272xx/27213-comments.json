      "body" : "We have 3 open questions that we are interested in hearing feedback from reviewers. We have considered many potential interactions and have laid out a couple specific ones along with tradeoffs of different approaches.\r\n\r\n### IBD \r\nThe first is regarding the interactions between this patch & IBD. Peers on privacy network might be slower than clearnet peers (eg. Tor or I2P). Our current proposal does not have any special case logic for disabling the network prioritization during IBD. \r\n\r\nThis could mean that our overall IBD speed is reduced by not having the fastest peers possible. The network peers could also be intermittently disconnected for stalling & get the node into a loop where it, for example, disconnects a Tor peer, connects to an IPV4 peer, re-adds a Tor peer and then keeps repeating. Finally, there could be interactions with the slow peers causing delays in the response time of the faster peers based on the specifics of our IBD logic. One solution is to just disable the network-specific outbound logic during IBD.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a node can get slow peers by random chance anyways. Whether randomly connecting to altnet peers or because a clearnet peer just happens to be slow. If they are slow, but not slow enough to be evicted due to the stalling limit, that will already have a significant impact on the IBD rate. The issues and potential solutions with improving IBD can be seen as tangential to this proposal, and we could favor not adding custom workarounds that serve as a bandaid to mask the root cause. Enabling alternative networks during IBD is already known to slow down the sync dramatically, and we can just add a warning in the documentation to help users become more aware. \r\n\r\n### Peers protected from eviction \r\nThis patch adds eviction protection for special network peers, but it only gets triggered when we have an extra outbound-full-relay peer (aka 9). This occurs when we detect a stale tip or because we added another special network peer. In these situations weâd want to ensure that we have at least one non-protected peer that can be disconnected so the node can return to the steady state of 8 full-relay outbound peers. \r\n\r\nCurrently, we protect 4 peers via `m_chain_sync.m_protect`, which are the first peers that send us headers corresponding to our best chain. This means 4 peers could be protected with this logic, and 3 more peers being protected by their network, leaving us just one peer to disconnect in the worst case. If we added support for one more alternative network (eg. yggdrasil ââin https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23531), a user activating all networks could run into a problem where they have 8 protected peers in these circumstances. \r\n\r\nAlthough these circumstances are unlikely for a couple different reasons, weâd like to have a clear mitigation strategy. One option is to reduce the number of peers we protect with the headers logic (via `m_protect`). Another is to limit the network-specific logic to 2 random networks or such. Another is to cross this bridge when we are implementing support for another network. \r\n\r\n### Network peer protection \r\nA potential concern of this patch is that the logic that protects network peers from eviction could be âover-protectiveâ. For example, keeping a Tor connection only because it is the only Tor connection, not because itâs providing us meaningful data.\r\n\r\nAny concerns around this are completely bounded by the fact that the protection logic is limited to when we have an _extra_ peer, either through stale tip detection or through the new temporary connections for network specific peers. \r\n\r\nHowever, if there is still concern, @ajtowns had an interesting idea to increase our likelihood of adding a 2nd peer from alternate networks. We could update the stale tip logic to choose the network of the extra outbound differently. Right now, the network odds reflect the proportions represented in `AddrMan`. Instead, we could amend the logic to select based on the proportion of networks we are connected to. This would increase our likelihood of connecting to the network, because, for example, youâre more likely to have â I2P peers than â of your addrman be I2P addresses. \r\n\r\nIncreasing the chances of connecting to a privacy network in that context has two benefits: \r\nIt serves the original intention of the stale top logic to be a last-ditch effort against a perceived eclipse attack. Overtaking multiple networks increases the cost of attack, so this is theoretically a more useful attempt than clearnet.\r\nFor this proposed patch, it would mean the node is more likely to add another peer from the alternate network, so the node is more able to replace a âbadâ network peer with hopefully a better one. This would be effective since the stale tip logic tends to run a couple times a day. \r\n\r\nThis could be treated as a separate chunk of work to be evaluated in a follow-up, or it could be incorporated into this PR if reviewers believe it could help mitigate concerns about edge case possibilities.

      "body" : "Concept ACK.\r\n\r\nThis was somewhere on my TODO, thanks for picking it up!\r\n\r\n> The automatic connections to alternate networks is done defensively, by first filling all outbound slots with random addresses (as in the status quo) and then adding additional peers from reachable networks the node is currently not connected to. This approach ensures that outbound slots are not left unfilled while attempting to connect to a network that may be unavailable due to a technical issue or misconfiguration that bitcoind cannot detect.\r\n\r\nHmm, this is maybe ok. Another approach would be to try to open to e.g. Tor while still having < 8 outbound connections. To counter the issue of staying with < 8 connections and not being able to open to Tor because e.g. the Tor proxy is broken, then we could give up after a few attempts and then fall back to the old way of filling with random (aka IPv4 ;-)) addresses. If we overshoot the 8 connections (like described above), then for some time we will have more, until eviction kicks in. How much time is that exactly? If that is short then it would be sub-optimal to open a IPv4 connection and drop it shortly after in cases where Tor connectivity is working smoothly. If it is long then we have practically increased the limit of 8 which will cause more traffic.\r\n\r\n> In the above, the clearnet networks IPv4 and IPv6 are counted as one network because diversification between these doesn't make sense and is impossible in some network environments.\r\n\r\nWhy it doesn't make sense? I think it is an extra effort to obtain IPv4 addresses if one has IPv6 addresses and the other way around. Why impossible in some network environments? After all you know if you are going to attempt to connect to `5.6.7.8` or `2030:c0fe:...`.\r\n\r\n> Manual connections are also taken into account: If a user already establishes manual connections to a trusted peer from a network, there is no longer a need to make extra efforts\r\n\r\n+1\r\n\r\n> IBD\r\n\r\nI think there is no need to add special logic during IBD (e.g. disable this PR during IBD). Clearnet peers can also be slow and non-clearnet peers may be fast-enough. IBD should be able to handle slow/fast peers already without special hand-holding.\r\n\r\n> Peers protected from eviction\r\n\r\nI think we don't need to worry about this now because even if we treat IPv4 and IPv6 as separate networks and all 4 from `m_protected` are from one network (e.g. IPv4), then we have 4 more slots for IPv6, Tor, I2P, CJDNS. If we implement more networks, maybe by that time we will have increased the default 8 or I would suggest to then start disconnecting from `m_protected`.\r\n\r\n> Network peer protection\r\n> A potential concern of this patch is that the logic that protects network peers from eviction could be âover-protectiveâ. For example, keeping a Tor connection only because it is the only Tor connection, not because itâs providing us meaningful data.\r\n\r\nI don't see it as \"over-protective\". Can we not have some metric of whether a peer is \"providing us a meaningful data\"? I am ok to deal with this in a followup.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTaking a step back, the root problem here is that addrman has many IPv4 addresses and few I2P ones (for example). If it would have equal number of addresses from each network, then this problem would not exist because then picking up a random one would have a 1/5 chance of selecting any network (thus there would not be any bias towards IPv4). Would it be simpler and solve the problem equally well if we only change addrman internally to return an address from any given network with a 1/5 chance? Then no need to change the eviction logic or the `ThreadOpenConnections` logic. And no need to _guarantee_ explicitly in the code that at least one connection exists to each network. It will happen by itself most of the time.",

The chance of not selecting IPv4 in all `8` choices is `p=(4/5)^8`. So, the chance of not selecting IPv4 or not selecting IPv6 is `2*p`. The chance of not selecting IPv4, or IPv6 or Tor or I2P or CJDNS is `5*p`. In other words, the chance of not being connected to at least one network is `5*p`, and thus the chance of being connected to all networks is `1-5*p`, or `16%` (`60%` for 4 nets, `88%` for 3 nets, `99%` for 2 nets and `100%` for 1 net).\r\n\r\nI think this is enough to ditch the idea of random-chance `Select()`.

This way, if we broadcast another tx after e.g. 1 hour the recipient will not be able to conclude that both transactions come from the same origin.\r\n\r\n> In order for that to work, it would be good to have stronger guarantee that we are actually connected to these networks.\r\n\r\nWould not be needed with temporary tx-broadcast connections.",

      "body" : "> Hmm, this is maybe ok. Another approach would be to try to open to e.g. Tor while still having < 8 outbound connections. To counter the issue of staying with < 8 connections and not being able to open to Tor because e.g. the Tor proxy is broken, then we could give up after a few attempts and then fall back to the old way of filling with random (aka IPv4 ;-)) addresses. If we overshoot the 8 connections (like described above), then for some time we will have more, until eviction kicks in. How much time is that exactly? If that is short then it would be sub-optimal to open a IPv4 connection and drop it shortly after in cases where Tor connectivity is working smoothly. If it is long then we have practically increased the limit of 8 which will cause more traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe thought about this, of course, because it's the most straightforward approach. However, don't like it as much as the approach here for several reasons:\r\n- it requires introducing an arbitrary waiting time, during which we might have less outbound connections, especially if this would happen for multiple networks at the same time.\r\n- having too few outbound connections is a a potential security risk for the node and slows down important processes such as IBD, the only downsides of having an extra outbound connection is to have a bit of extra traffic, plus temporarily requiring more inbound capacity from the network.\r\n- churning through a few short-lived extra connections has several unrelated benefits, we do it voluntarily anyway (feeler connections), so I'd think it's no big deal.\r\n- the conditions which precluded us from connecting to a network might correct over time (maybe we had a lot of bad addresses in our addrman in the beginning; maybe some technical problem). Just trying a couple of times right after startup, and then giving up wouldn't be ideal in this scenario. \r\n\r\nI guess it boils down to that in general, I think temporarily having more outbound connections than our target is preferable to temporarily having less connections.",

Though maybe there is an extra effort for a potential eclipse attacker to cover both IPv4 and IPv6?\r\n2) IPv4-only network setups exist, I've experienced it more than once that I would be within a network of some organization and could only connect to IPv4 peers, but bitcoind wasn't able to detect that so I'd see regular attempts to make connection to IPv6 peers which all failed immediately.\r\n\r\nSo basically, we saw no clear upsides, and some downsides, and that's why we decided to add it.\r\nBut I'm not insistent on this if people think that there is enough benefit in having connections to both IPv4 and IPv6 peers - it would also make the code cleaner if we didn't have to apply this exception in multiple places.\r\n\r\nIt had nothing to do with the number of 8 protected peers. I'm sure we could find other solutions around that edge case problem, e.g. adding logic to just not try an extra outbound in the first place when we could get into a position where we don't have an unprotected peer to evict, or softening the protection during eviction as vasild suggested.",

Does the delta in energy required from the attacker feel meaningful? \r\n\r\n@0xB10C\r\n> I had the feeling that protecting only one IPv4 or IPv6 could, for example, reduce the number of inbound connections IPv6-only nodes get. However, Iâm not sure if thatâs really the case (I need to think about this more).\r\n\r\nHm interesting. \r\nOur current baseline is that we have no protections based on network. \r\nBy introducing network protections, we would expect the number of inbounds for IPV4 and IPV6 to drop compared to the current conditions. \r\nItâs likely that conflating the two networks would impact the distribution between them, but would that be problematic? \r\n\r\n### Future improvements\r\nAgreed these are orthogonal to the current proposal, but are very interesting ideas worth further exploration! \r\n\t- temporary tx broadcast connections\r\n\t- block-relay-only connections per network ",
