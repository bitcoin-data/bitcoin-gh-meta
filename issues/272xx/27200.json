   "body" : "This PR adds missing test coverage for dropping non-witness UTXOs from PSBTs for segwit v1+ inputs (see commit 103c6fd2791f7e73eeab7f3900fbedd5b550211d). The formerly [disabled](46004790588c24174a0bec49b540d158ce163ffd) method `test_utxo_conversion` is re-enabled and adapted to spend a Taproot (`bech32m`) instead of a wrapped SegWit (`p2sh-segwit`) output. Note that in contrast to the original test, we have to add the non-witness UTXO manually here using the test framework's PSBT module, since the constructing node knows that the output is segwit v1 and hence doesn't add the non-witness UTXO in the first place (see also [BIP371]( https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0371.mediawiki#user-content-UTXO_Types)).\r\n\r\nI strongly assume that most wallets would behave the same as Bitcoin Core here and wouldn't create PSBTs with non-witness UTXOs for Taproot inputs, but it's still good to test everything works as expected if it's still done and that the non-witness UTXO is simply dropped in that case.\r\n\r\nThe first two commits contain a small refactor (magic number elimination in PSBT module) and test speedup of ~2-3x (using whitelisting peers / immediate tx relay).",
