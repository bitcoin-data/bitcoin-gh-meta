Weâd only open a persistent outbound connection to peers which have a different netgroup compared to those netgroups present in `setConnected`.\r\n\r\n**behaviour on master**\r\n\r\nwe open persistent outbound connections to peers which have different netgroups compared to outbound full relay, block relay, addrfetch and feeler connection peers.\r\n\r\n**behaviour on PR**\r\n\r\nnetgroup diversity is based on outbound full relay, block relay and manual connection peers.\r\n\r\n**rationale**\r\n\r\n- addrfetch and feeler connections are short lived connections and shouldnât affect how we select outbound peers from addrman.\r\n- manual connections are like regular connections when viewed from addrmanâs netgroup diversity point of view and should affect how we select outbound peers from addrman",
