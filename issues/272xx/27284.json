Afaict currently, the only benefit of our benchmarking tests is to evaluate changes as they are being proposed but imo that only gives us ~50% of the benefit that benchmarks can provide.\r\n\r\nI am imagining this to be a separate service (maybe integrated with @DrahtBot) that regularly runs the benchmarks in an environment configured for benchmarking. Regressions could be reported by the service through opening issues or sending emails. Additionally, a website that presents the benchmark data with some pretty graphs would be nice ([example from firefox's infra](https://treeherder.mozilla.org/perfherder/graphs?highlightAlerts=1&highlightChangelogData=1&highlightCommonAlerts=0&series=mozilla-central,3405208,1,13&timerange=31536000)).\r\n\r\nSetting this up in a way that it is easy to replicate would be very beneficial.",
