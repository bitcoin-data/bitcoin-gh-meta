There's no reason to ignore someone setting `-nodatacarrier` to indicate they don't want OP_RETURN outputs in their mempool.\r\n\r\nLike I said, bare `OP_RETURN` outputs are *not* data carrying outputs. Treating them as such is misleading.\r\n\r\nSecond, if you are going to take that attitude, why do we even have the `-nodatacarrier` option? Setting  `-datacarriersize=0` will also prevent bare `OP_RETURN` outputs. Which actually suggests we should fix that redundancy if we want both options.\r\n\r\n@instagibbs Last time I checked a few months ago I could find examples of every single active mining pool mining data carrying OP_RETURN outputs. So yes, the `-nodatacarrier` option is likely entirely unused by ~100% of all hashing power. Secondly, since `-nodatacarrier` acts to censor transactions otherwise supported by ~100% of nodes, individual relay nodes setting it makes absolutely no difference to whether or not transactions reach miners. So I'm ok with just removing it.",
