   "body" : "This pull request is part of the `libbitcoinkernel` project https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24303 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/18 and more specifically its \"Step 2: Decouple most non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel\". This commit was originally authored by empact and are taken from their parent PR #25152.\r\n\r\n#### Context\r\n\r\nThere is an ongoing effort to decouple the `ArgsManager` used for command line parsing user-provided arguments from the libbitcoinkernel library (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25527, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25862, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26177, and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125). The `ArgsManager` is defined in `system.h`. A similar pull request extracting functionality from `system.h` has been merged in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27238.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\nNext to providing better code organization, this PR removes some reliance of the tree of libbitcoinkernel header includes on `system.h` (and thus the `ArgsManager` definition) by moving filesystem related functions out of the `system.*` files. \r\n\r\nThere is already a pair of `fs.h` / `fs.cpp` in the top-level `src/` directory. They were not combined with the files introduced here, to keep the patch smaller and more importantly because they are often included without the utility functions.\r\n\r\nFurther commits splitting more functionality out of `system.h` are still in #25152 and will be submitted in separate PRs once this PR has been processed.",
