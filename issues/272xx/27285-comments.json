The goal is to prune as many files as possible out of the library. This also stated in stage 1 step 2 of the original kernel issue: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24303 . Once stage 2 is reached, there may be a discussion again of a shared build artifact containing the intersection of files between the kernel and another library. Since there is no telling yet what this might look like, I don't think it's productive to discuss now or in the nearer future.",
