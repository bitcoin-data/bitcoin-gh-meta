   "body" : "This is a refactoring change. So I have read the following and will try to answer why this change should be accepted\r\n\r\n> * Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or **_otherwise improve developer experience significantly_**. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n\r\nI have noticed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26899#discussion_r1086731856 that the helper message for `-listen` does not use string interpolation.\r\n\r\nThat confused me and I wasn't sure what the reasons for that are. So it could be argued this confusion (by possibly many people in the past and in the future) may already be enough to accept this change.\r\n\r\nHowever, not accepting this means that if `DEFAULT_LISTEN` is ever changed, this helper message will still use the old value (however unlikely that may be).\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR makes the helper message consistent with how other helper messages are implemented (using string interpolation) which leads to less confusion and prevents possibly wrong documentation in the future.",
