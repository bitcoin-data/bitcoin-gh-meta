In the case of a 0-valued OP_RETURN, and fee rate of 0, and automatic coin-selection enabled, you would want the wallet to pick a single UTXO (which gets sent entirely to the change output).\r\n> > Given that there are a few moving pieces to enable the use case you are talking about (fixing Knapsack, SelectCoins, etc), I'd recommend we merge this change now and once the other changes are complete, we can update this check to something like:\r\n> > ```\r\n> > if (selection_target == 0 && !coin_control.HasSelected() && !add_inputs)\r\n> > ```\r\n> \r\n> Yep, re-check the \"To Summarize\" part of my first message :) [#27271 (review)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27271#pullrequestreview-1348743895). That is what the commit that shared there is doing: [furszy@0745191](https://github.com/furszy/bitcoin-core/commit/07451919c2f233e82ab7eb021a3aec5a08b35e0a)\r\n\r\nWe are proposing different things: I am saying _don't_ add the check for `!m_allow_other_inputs` now, and instead merge the PR as is. Once we have fixed coin selection to handle this edge case, we add the check for `!m_allow_other_inputs` and update the error message in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nWith what you are proposing in [furszy@0745191](https://github.com/furszy/bitcoin-core/commit/07451919c2f233e82ab7eb021a3aec5a08b35e0a), the node will still crash after this PR is merged if someone passes `add_inputs: True`",
