By default clang-tidy will print errors arrising from included headers in leveldb and other dependencies. By passing `--enable-suppress-external-warnings` flag to configure, errors arising from external dependencies are suppressed. Additional errors arrising from internal dependencies such as leveldb are suppressed by passing the `src/.bear-tidy-config` configuration file to bear. This file includes exclusionary rules for leveldb.",
