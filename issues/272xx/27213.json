   "body" : "This is joint work with mzumsande. \r\n\r\nThe first section of this PR has been broken out into #27214. This PR encapsulates the full logic & context.\r\n\r\nThe current logic that makes automatic outbound connections doesnât try to diversify with respect to reachable networks - the decision to connect to a particular address from `AddrMan` is based purely on the frequency of available addresses. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if `AddrMan` is populated primarily with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and only a handful of onion addresses, it is likely that we won't establish any automatic outbound connections to Tor, even if we're capable of doing so. For smaller networks like CJDNS, this is even more of an issue and often requires adding manual peers to ensure regularly being connected to the network.\r\n\r\nConnecting to multiple networks improves resistance to eclipse attacks for individual nodes. It also benefits the entire p2p network by increasing partition resistance and privacy in general. \r\n\r\nThis PR increases diversity of a nodeâs automated outbounds by automatically connecting to alternate reachable networks and adding eviction logic that protects one existing connection to each network. \r\n\r\nThe automatic connections to alternate networks is done defensively, by first filling all outbound slots with random addresses (as in the status quo) and then adding additional peers from reachable networks the node is currently not connected to. This approach ensures that outbound slots are not left unfilled while attempting to connect to a network that may be unavailable due to a technical issue or misconfiguration that bitcoind cannot detect.\r\n\r\nOnce an additional peer is added and we have one more outbound connection than we want, outbound eviction ensures that peers are protected if they are the only ones for their network.\r\n\r\nThis draft PR consists of three steps:\r\n1.) Add ability to `AddrMan` to Select an address from a specified network\r\n2.) Protect peers from outbound eviction if they are the only ones for their network.\r\n3.) Add logic to `ThreadOpenConnections` to make extra connections to peers from reachable networks we are currently not connected to.\r\n\r\nIn the above, the clearnet networks IPv4 and IPv6 are counted as one network because diversification between these doesn't make sense and is impossible in some network environments.\r\n\r\nManual connections are also taken into account: If a user already establishes manual connections to a trusted peer from a network, there is no longer a need to make extra efforts to ensure we also have an automatic connection to it (although this may of course happen by random selection). \r\n",
