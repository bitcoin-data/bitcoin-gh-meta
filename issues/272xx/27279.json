   "body" : "Based on discussion and concept ACKed in #27138, add a `warnings` field to RPCs createwallet, loadwallet, unloadwallet, and restorewallet as a JSON array of strings to replace the `warning` string field in these 4 RPCs. The idea is to more gracefully handle multiple warning messages and for consistency with other wallet RPCs.  Then, deprecate the latter fields, which represent all the remaining RPC `warning` fields.\r\n\r\nThe first commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27279/commits/f73782a9032a462a71569e9424db9bf9eeababf3 implements https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27138#issuecomment-1474789198 as an alternative to #27138. One of those two could potentially be backported to our currently supported releases.\r\n",
