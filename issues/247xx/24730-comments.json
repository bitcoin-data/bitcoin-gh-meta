If the block was created with CNB at an earlier height, it is wrong to just use the height of the tip when updating the extra nonce.\r\n\r\nI think you are reporting two bugs:\r\n* A race in the tests, as the functional tests shouldn't compete for the tip block in normal operation?\r\n* A race in `IncrementExtraNonce`\r\n\r\nI think the bug in IncrementExtraNonce can be fixed by removing the function. Not sure about test bug.",
