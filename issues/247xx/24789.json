   "body" : "When started together with `-reindex-chainstate`, currently coinstatsindex gets corrupted and the blockfilterindex flatfiles duplicated. See the OP of #24630 for more a more detailed explanation on why this happens.\r\n\r\nThis is an alternative to #24630 which does not wipe and rebuild the indexes but returns an `InitError` when they are activated, thus requiring the user to deactivate them temporarily until the `-reindex-chainstate` run is finished.\r\n\r\nThis also disallows `-reindex-chainstate` in combination with `-txindex`, which is not leading to corruption, but currently still rebuilds the index unnecessarily and unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nAs a long-term goal, it would be desirable to have the indexes tolerate `reindex-chainstate` by ignoring their `BlockConnected` notifications (there is discussion in #24630 about this) or possibly move `reindex-chainstate` option  into a `bitcoin-chainstate` executable, which could also solve the problem. But these would be larger projects - until then, it might be better to disallow the interaction than having corrupted indexes.\r\n\r\nThe first commit adjusts the `-reindex` doc to mention that this option does rebuild all active indexes.\r\n",
