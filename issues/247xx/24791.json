   "body" : "The dark gray color used to mark skipped functional tests is somewhat unfortunate. I don't see skipped tests at all with my terminal settings unless I mark the text. For others, dark gray/black is hard to read on a gray background. \r\n\r\nMy terminal:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19157360/162059456-7a21da0d-8a6c-4d03-ad2a-261e0c7209ec.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19157360/162059921-9d5a1b19-4198-4b82-aa22-bb50c03a0c0d.png)\r\n\r\nAnd @jacobpfickes terminal from [twitter](https://twitter.com/cryptocowboy__/status/1511505046378266627) which reminded me to open this good first issue.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19157360/162060107-e3188d00-4226-4822-ac6e-29e0ec225302.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, during review it's important to see which tests were skipped. It could happen that you think you've run the tests for something, but you in fact haven't and the tests were skipped, but you just don't notice.\r\n\r\nA solution would be to use a yellow/orange color to mark skipped tests. Green for pass, red for fail and yellow/orange for skipped. Another easy solution would be for me to change my terminal settings, however I think the gray text on gray background could affect more devs than just me.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the colored functional tests output was introduced in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10159.\r\n\r\n#### Useful skills:\r\n\r\nPython and running the functional tests. \r\n\r\n#### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",
