It's a limited palette so having any unusable colors is a waste. The default color scheme tends to be most suitable for white backgrounds (usually) but every terminal will allow you to change them.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm not against changing the colors but it seems like a literal shed-painting issue, there's always going to be someone with a background shade / palette combination that will have trouble seeing some color.",

      "body" : "TL;DR: This issue degrades the UX of the report for a minority of users. The suggest resolution #24793 slightly degrades the UX of the remaining users. Perhaps its worth exploring whether @laanwj's suggestion of ```\\033[0;90m``` would resolve the issue whilst minimising the impact on unaffected users before moving ahead with #24793?\r\n\r\nGiven that the potential for 'shed re-painting' has already been raised by other users, perhaps a more detailed exposition of the factors at play, written as a set of challengable assertions and assumptions, would aid any further discussion. See below if you are interested:\r\n\r\n### On the purpose of the report and how the colour of the skipped items help to achieve this\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the report in order of priority:\r\n1. state whether the test run passed or failed\r\n1. list failed test - to show the user which tests should be explored further to understand what went wrong\r\n1. list passed test - so the user can confirm that the expected tests actually ran and passed\r\n1. highlight how long each test, and the test run in total, took so that they can identify when tests are running unusually slow\r\n1. list skipped test - so the user can see if they neglected to run a test they intended to\r\n\r\nThree UI tools are used in the in are used to indicate the result:\r\n1. colour (currently Green/Red/Grey)\r\n1. text label (Passed/Failed/Skipped)\r\n1. icon\r\n\r\nThe text label provides the clearest indication of the outcome of the test but is only ever read peripherally as this information is embedded directly onto the name of test through its colour.\r\n\r\nThe pass/fail to green/red colour mapping are a universal standard in CLI test reports and are therefore intuitive to most users.\r\n\r\nThe skipped to 'muted standard text colour' colour mapping is widely, but not universal, used in CLI test reports. 'Standard body text colour' and yellow are other colours sometimes used.\r\n\r\n### On the impact of the issue\r\n\r\nFor a minority of users it appears as illegibly close to the background colour but different enough to make it clear that there is text present.\r\n\r\nWorkaround - most user can make it legible simply by selecting the text. This is likely to be intuitive to most to CLI users.\r\n\r\nThis provides a poor UX 1) for a nice to have feature of the report and 2) the general usage of the report as the interface is jarring and strains the eyes.\r\n\r\n### On the cause of the issue:\r\n\r\nTerminals vary in their default background colour and their interpretation of colour values. Most allow these setting to be customised.\r\nWhen CLIs use colour there is no guarantee that their display will meet access ability standards.\r\n\r\n### In defense of the status quo\r\n\r\nFor the majority of users the colour chosen for skipped items appears as 'muted standard text colour'. This is most appropriate colour for 2 reasons:\r\n1. it is commonly used standards for CLI test run reports\r\n1. the skipped tests are the least important information to communicate so de-emphasising them improves the usability of the report\r\n\r\nThe use of ```\\033[1;30m'``` as a muted colour should work across all sensibly configured terminals. If this isn't the case then a bug should be raised with the terminal vendor.\r\n\r\nSome users (eg. @ayush933 and @kristapsk) have suggested #24793 (using the default colour) degrades the usability of the report.\r\n\r\nThis issue only affects a minority of users assumed to be 2-5%.\r\n\r\n### Arguments for using the default text color as proposed in #24793:\r\n\r\nDue to the variety of colour interpretation in CLIs colours should be used sparingly. The slight usability benefits of using grey are outweighed by the significant degradation for the minority of users.\r\n\r\n### Arguments for searching for an alternative\r\n\r\n@laanwj suggestion of ```\\033[0;90m``` may resolve the issue without degrading the reports usability for other users.\r\n\r\n### Recommendation\r\n\r\nExplore whether ```\\033[0;90m``` is preferable to #24793 for both affected and unaffected users. If it is not: fallback to #24793 as the severity of the usability impact on affected users (assumed to be 2-5% of the user-base) outweighs the minor usability degradation for unaffected users. \r\n",
