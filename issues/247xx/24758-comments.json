But maybe this is more complicated to implement.\r\n\r\nThe point is that we *cannot* have a complete view of what the GUI thread does. By nature it calls into the operating system to do things like rendering. In the worst case this involves, say, proprietary video drivers. Or special constructions for input devices. Just adding syscalls when they come up is a bottomless pit of despair.\r\n\r\nThis is a fundamental problem with system-call based sandboxing. It's a layer violation. Sandboxing other threads also suffers from this problem, but less. E.g., libraries that are dynamically linked (say, glibc) may change the system calls they use at any point (this happens pretty often). GUI is just especially bad in this regard.\r\n\r\nI agree that the other threads could still be sandboxed, ideally, because even if they do have callbacks to Qt code they shouldn't be doing any rendering or input handling.\r\n\r\n> To work around this with the GUI, the initial lock-down for the main thread would need to be skipped. Presumably the restriction on the main thread, once it gets renamed to shutoff as well.\r\n\r\nSounds like a good solution to me. The difference would be that part of the initialization process wouldn't be sandboxed either. This is fine, sandboxing is mostly interesting for threads that communicate with anything untrusted.\r\n",

It's a layer violation.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, one project that attempts to work around these kind of fragility of syscall sandboxing, in the Linux kernel, is https://landlock.io/ . It groups certain logical actions as being allowed or not instead of micro-managing syscalls. But it's still under heavy development I don't think it makes sense to start using that at this point.\r\n\r\nAlso, even then the GUI is probablyâ¦ weird\r\n",
