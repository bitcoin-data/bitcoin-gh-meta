I've already done some experiments running them in the CI in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23296, however I haven't been successful with it yet. The main issue was the limited capabilities inside the CirrusCI docker container.\r\n\r\nAn option would be to ask CirrusCI for help, another would be to run this part in a VM, if it's not to much overhead.",
