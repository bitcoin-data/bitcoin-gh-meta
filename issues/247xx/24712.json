   "body" : "Remove coin selection iteration requiring 6 confs\r\n    \r\nIt's not clear what purpose we serve with this additional iteration of coin selection that restricts foreign UTXOs to at least six confirmations.\r\n    \r\nIf the wallet hasn't been used in a long time, requiring six confirmations or one is equivalent. If the wallet has just received\r\n    funds, the important distinction is still between confirmed and    unconfirmed UTXOs: we haven't had any reorgs of more than a single block    in multiple years, and the ones we had have been benignâthe differences    of included transactions between blocks at the same height is generally    minuscule and can be explained by transaction relay latency or the rate    of block template updates. The risk of a UTXO getting reorged out due to    requiring a single confirmation instead of six can be discounted and    doesn't suffice to instigate a full additional coin selection iteration.",
