   "body" : "This issue has already been the topic of #24610.\r\n\r\nmacOS, sadly, does not ship with a bash version that is compatible with all lint tests since they now include the usage of `mapfile`. `mapfile` was introduced in `bash` 4.0 but macOS still uses 3.x because the newer version changed their license from GPL2 to GPL3. macOS has changed the default shell to `zsh` but that doesn't help since bash 3.x is still installed and will be used due to the shebang. Also, `zsh` does not have `mapfile` the same way `bash` has. Confusingly, the `zsh` version of the command does something completely different than the `bash` version.\r\n\r\nIncluding guard code was rejected in #24610 and I guess this is probably reasonable since only a hand full of developers will ever run into this. But I think it should still be mentioned in the docs.",
