One issue would be that it forces every contributor to use a dev environment that formats the code. Another one is that our current tests reformatted with `black` don't look great, as `black` enforces short lines. (Fixing this would require large-scale refactoring of most of the tests)\r\n\r\nI don't think there is any issue to be fixed here. As mentioned previously, we leave the style up to the original author. Thus, no time is wasted on style during review. Of course, anyone is free to use `black`, if they like for their own code they submit.",
