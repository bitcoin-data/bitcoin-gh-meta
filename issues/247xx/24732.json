   "body" : "IncrementExtraNonce has many issues:\r\n\r\n* It is test-only code, but part of bitcoind\r\n* It is using the block height of the tip, as opposed to the block's previous block as reference for the new height. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24730#issuecomment-1085586193\r\n* It has no use case in regtest testing. With a low difficulty the extra nonce won't be incremented. With a high difficulty the test-only functions are clumsy to handle anyway. For example, the generate* RPCs will return an empty array once they reached `maxtries`, as opposed to an error. Also the calls can't be aborted early unless the node shuts down completely. So I think it is fine to just remove the extra nonce functionality and leave it to the outside to implement, if needed. For example, a wrapper script can call the `generate*` RPCs once every second, to use the timestamp as extra nonce.",
