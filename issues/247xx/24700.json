I have a computer with only 1GB of RAM and no swap; while syncing headers it runs out of memory. Approximately, 600,000 headers is where it runs out.\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\nI expected to be able to sync all the headers and then start downloading/verifying the blockchain.\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\nWhile syncing the headers my device runs out of memory.\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\nI can reproduce this issue every time. Simply, start the bitcoin-qt application and wait until it runs out of memory at approximately 600,000 headers.\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\ndebian package 22.0-1\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nOrange Pi One http://www.orangepi.org/orangepione/\r\nCPU: H3 Quad-core Cortex-A7 H.265/HEVC 4K\r\nDrive: 256GB microSD\r\n\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue? What is your operating system and its version? If Linux, what is your desktop environment and graphical shell? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n\r\nThis issue is probably caused because all the headers are stored in RAM.\r\n\r\nEventually this will become a problem with common lower end computers even if they have swap when the index becomes too large.\r\n\r\nIt is an important issue to consider so that cheap nodes can be run in third world countries to ensure good decentralization of the network.\r\n",
