      "body" : "My personal opinion: decreasing the effect of propagation delay on consensus is very interesting, but it's far from the only reason why the block rate or transaction rate on the Bitcoin network are limited. A shorter time between blocks (all else remaining equal) would proportionally impact SPV nodes at least (who will need to download a correspondingly higher number of headers). A higher transaction throughput impacts pretty much all resource requirements on the network.\n\nWhen the time comes to increase one of those limits (because software and hardware are capable of the increased traffic and validation overhead that comes with it), we'll need to investigate how to do it, and all research about it is interesting. The choice of when to do this needs far wider consensus than just developers, however, in my opinion, as it affects anyone running a full node.\n",

One obvious one is \"Once adoption of the currency increases, the system will need to scale to process transactions at a greater rate than before.\" - firstly, bitcoin is not a currency, but is often being treated as such, and secondly, the system  doesn't need to scale (at least, not unless people want to continue treating it as a currency). Bitcoin may indeed fork to include the functionality to let it scale - but there will be people who will want to continue using the bitcoin as it is now, so I believe if a fork ever happens, it will be a fork where both forks have different exchange rates.\n",
