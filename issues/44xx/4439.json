   "body" : "[GHOST](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881.pdf) is a suggestion to speed up the potential processing speed of Bitcoin ~ 600 fold. It requires a hard fork.\n\nCan someone clarify the position of the Bitcoin devs regarding GHOST?\nIf someone created a pull request that implements GHOST in Core, would that be accepted? What kind of testing/discussion/consensus is need for that?\n\nI'm aware that such issues are usually discussed on the mailing list, but I'd like to open this as a proper issue. Note that the issue isn't to integrate or not to integrate GHOST, but rather to clarify the 'official position' (whatever that might mean in Bitcoin) regarding GHOST.\n\nP.S I believe Ethereum are using a variant of GHOST.\n",
