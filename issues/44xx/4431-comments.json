I still mantain, however, that 2 minutes is far riskier than my suggested 10 seconds, as at a 2 minute timeout this can significantly cause atypical nodes to delay block propagation by them issuing the latest block inv as quickly as possible (before they've even got the headers), and then ignoring the getdata block request. With my code, this is mitigated significantly, and it's highly unlikely and unusual for a node to not start sending a block within 10 seconds of it being requested - this is based on over two years of testing.

Effectively a two minute timeout increases the minimum bandwidth that can keep a node running bitcoin by more than 5 fold. This of behavior means that moderate or short lived DOS attacks (or just high utilization) can cause disconnection potentially allowing an attacker to partition the network.\n\nYesâ malicious nodes attacking the network can potentially slow down receiving blocks (and thats still true with your change). This is part of why the standard advice (and widespread practice) for mining nodes is to not expose them to the public network directly. Increasing partition risk, or reducing the ability to run slow or overloaded links at all isn't a good trade-off.\n\nI'd really encourage you to spend time testing headers first.\n",

It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5.
