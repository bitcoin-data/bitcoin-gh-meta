This is the recommended approach.\n-- Download the source code, build each dependency, add the required include paths, link libraries and binary tools to the Visual Studio project files.\n-- Use [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/) packages with the understanding that any binary files have been compiled by an untrusted third party.\n+```\n \n-The [external dependencies](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/dependencies.md) required for building are listed in the `build_msvc/vcpkg.json` file. To ensure `msbuild` project files automatically install the `vcpkg` dependencies use:\n+By default, vcpkg makes both `release` and `debug` builds for each package.\n+To save build time and disk space, one could skip `debug` builds (example uses PowerShell):\n+```powershell\n \n-```\n-vcpkg integrate install\n+Add-Content -Path \"vcpkg\\triplets\\x64-windows-static.cmake\" -Value \"set(VCPKG_BUILD_TYPE release)\"\n ```\n \n Qt\n ---------------------\n-In order to build Bitcoin Core a static build of Qt is required.

You don't want to know how long I've spent getting the Qt build working.\r\n>\r\n> Putting aside the lost chunk of my life it would be a big change switching the build to dynamic linking. All the Bitcoin Core libraries would have to be built as dll's and there are then bound to be missing exports that will need to be added which would mean code changes.\r\n>\r\n> I'd highly recommend sticking with static linking for consistency with the other Bitcoin Core builds. Hopefully one day the `vcpkg` static build of Qt will work and allow it to be treated the same as the other dependencies for the msvc build. See microsoft/vcpkg#4560 (comment).",
