I'm sorry I forget which) using `nSequence` for other purposes, and in production too IIRC. They wanted to be able to continue doing what they were doing without interruption, and having `SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_DISABLE_FLAG` be available for them was the compromise--meaning that it was critically important that setting this flag *not* result in their transactions being excluded from the mempool.\r\n\r\nNow I haven't seen anyone use `nSequence` for anything else since then, but then I don't keep up to date on all the projects in this space.

Note, such weird range of bits could be a protocol watermark such as the Lightning obscured commitment number in commitment transactions.\r\n\r\nFurther, I've a second wonder about this discouraging effectiveness w.r.t to hypothetical future semantic. If we assume the upgrade semantics to be well-designed, they will set bit31 to disable bip69 semantic. Doing so, if they need more than the 14 uninterpreted bits, they might reuse the interpreted ones to encode their new field ? If they do so, the SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_MASK bits might be set and not catch by this discouraging check.\r\n\r\nI think those wonders express a trade-off, if we make this discouraging check more efficient to better preserve upgradeability, we're increasing the risk to silently the broadcast of any Bitcoin software interpreting `nSequence` for a special purpose ?",

I think most discussion should be on the mailing list.\r\n\r\nI have actually been sitting on a draft email on the full RBF stuff, letting it stew before I stick my nose in that. The basics of my thought process is that we should really only be using comitted transaction data for consensus purposes, not to signal mempool policies. This would also let us get rid of the annoying RBF 0xfffffffe and 0xfffffffd check since those have no consensus meaning. So I'm for it from a 'unfuck the code' perspective.\r\n\r\nI think one point that's also worth noting is that there are two different standardness rules here, one applies to transaction nSeq the other to script CSV argument. The policies can (and do in this PR) differ.\r\n\r\nI think it would make sense to merge something like this early in the release cycle (to signal it is going to be released, giving people time to complain) and potentially even activate the standardness rule as a flag day or go full BIP-9 if there is a strong worry about it. It's a standardness flag, not consensus, so we can do whatever we want. But we should be sure that people have time to complain. The only thing I don't want to happen is for someone to see this issue, and then start using nSequence in a way that would limit the upgradability because they can. That would be annoying, so I think we'd want to ensure any arguments are presented in good faith (with e.g. testnet or mainnet examples of the behavior being used before we act). ",

However as we all know this original naive idea didn't work and it took a combination of BIP68 consensus rules and RBF mempool policy to actually implement a useful form of transaction replacement in the mempool. At this time nSequence took on consensus meaning, but there was a lot of push back from 3rd party protocol developers who were already treating nSequence as a 4-byte-per-input private use field. Thus `SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_DISABLE_FLAG` was added, and in a way that very purposefully did not impact non-consensus use of nSequence.\r\n\r\nThat said, bitcoin is now twice as old as when this decision was made. Does anyone actually use nSequence for non-consensus purposes anymore? If not, then this patch makes some sense.",

It would mean that whatever new script semantics applied to the unused portions of the CSV argument would have to then also require that transaction version 3 is used. However, there's not really a sound way that we can specify which transaction version for CSV semantics we are requiring at output creation time (e.g., v2 or v3) so we have to be proactive about fixing that case in my opinion. Concretely, suppose we said if bit 24 is set require tx version == 3, that would be a new consensus rule applying to things that could have been previously happening on tx version == 2, so if we're ever to make use of the unused bits in CSV for any consensus reason we should do this.\r\n\r\nWith respect to nSeqeunce itself, I think I agree that the semantics could be done separately for tx version 3 vs version 2. However, if we are going through the trouble of fixing CSV upgradability, it seems reasonable to me to fix both.",
