   "body" : "Since there are other projects relying on transaction relay policy, it was suggested to document the policy. However, this comes with questions and obstacles. For example, documentation might misrepresent what is done in the code, due to:\r\n  * misunderstanding of the author\r\n  * it becoming stale/outdated\r\n  * it being incomplete\r\n\r\nMy recommendation for users is to test all of their use cases on each upgrade of Bitcoin Core, including all edge cases they rely on, ideally with an automated test suite to minimize their repeated work. Thus they should already be aware of the policy rules they rely on, and also be notified of changes by their test suite.\r\n\r\nIf there are plans to nonetheless document the relay policy, it raises questions what to include in what form and how to keep it up-to-date/consistent.",
