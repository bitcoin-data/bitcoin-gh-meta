However, the issue only applies when you're dividing by a variable.\r\n\r\nWhenever you're dividing by a constant that's known at compile time, the compiler will just convert it to a multiplication at optimization time, similar to what you're doing by hand here.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, some of the cases you're highlighting are divisions by an integer; you can't replace them by a multiplication with a floating point number (the result will be a different data type). It **is** possible to convert integer division by a constant to something faster as well, but it's a little more complicated (depending on the situation, it may involve multiplications, shifts, or a combination of the two).\r\n\r\nLastly, none of the cases you point out are performance critical. It's better to focus optimization efforts on places where it matters.",
