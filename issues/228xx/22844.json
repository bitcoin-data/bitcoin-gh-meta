   "body" : "This relates to #19389 by enabling mypy to run without `--ignore-imports`. This is the minimum amount of work needed to get mypy running in the linter, after which annotations can be added to scripts in `contrib/` and `test_framework/` to get the full benefit of running mypy in the linter.\r\n\r\n## special notes\r\n\r\nThis also involved updating PyZMQ per https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19389#issuecomment-850092152 .\r\n\r\n## how to test\r\n\r\nafter making these changes, I ran `./test/lint/lint-python.sh` and verified no errors. \r\n\r\nTo be sure mypy would actually catch type errors when they existed, I added the following lines to `contrib/devtools/symbol-checker.py`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef check_imported_symbols(filename: str) -> bool:\r\n    test = filename + 1\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, `filename` needed to be annotated as str, or else mypy treats it as `Any` and `Any +1` is allowed. After annotating `filename: str` and adding an illegal operation, running ./test/lint/lint-python.sh` returned the following error:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncontrib/devtools/symbol-check.py:170:5: F841 local variable 'test' is assigned to but never used\r\ncontrib/devtools/symbol-check.py:170: error: Unsupported operand types for + (\"str\" and \"int\")  [operator]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## next steps\r\n\r\nWhere we do have mypy annotations, they are often incomplete. This causes mypy to evaluate arguments as `Any` (see example above with `symbol-checker.py`). I propose a follow-up PR adding annotations. At a minimum, annotations should be added for everything in `test_framework/`, which can be done fairly easily with `monkeytype`. The benefit of this is, now that we are running without `--ignore-imports`, mypy can detect errors in the functional tests even if they don't have annotations, so long as all of the files in `test_framework/` are fully annotated.",
