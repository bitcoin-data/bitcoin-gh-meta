   "body" : "Fixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/22865. Required for https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21702 tests.\r\n\r\nThe basic issue is that that the current exclude flag doesn't play nicely with flags like DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS + SOME_OPCODE_VERIFY.\r\n\r\nWhen you have a valid TX under SOME_OPCODE_VERIFY, then the tests will try disabling that flag and it will trip over DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS.\r\n\r\nWhen you exclude DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS, then it gets re-included when the test checks all cominations of the excluded flags being re-enabled to show failure, but then it doesn't fail when SOME_OPCODE_VERIFY is set.\r\n\r\nTo address this, we add two optional fields: 1, a list of flags to *always enable*; 2, a bool of if to disable the one-by-one checker.\r\n\r\nBy then testing the same vector with:\r\n```\r\n...'DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS', 'NONE', true]\r\n...'NONE', 'SOME_OPCODE_VERIFY']\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe get around the one flag at a time checker.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach, that would provide better testing coverage, would allow a more abritrary relationship checker that can be specificed by the test writer (e.g., a map of flag to implied flag) to be used during the one-by-one checker.\r\n\r\nWe cannot simply apply these rules in FillFlags/TrimFlags because if we have a transaction that *should* fail normally with VERIFY_SOME_OPCODE and DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_OPCODES we can't support both cases.\r\n\r\nThis gap arose when implementing test vectors for BIP-119. Along the way I also discovered that, e.g., CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY's Upgradable NOP treatment is improperly asserted as per:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                   // To provide for future soft-fork extensibility, if the\r\n                    // operand has the disabled lock-time flag set,\r\n                    // CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY behaves as a NOP.\r\n                    if ((nSequence & CTxIn::SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_DISABLE_FLAG) != 0)\r\n                        break\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich does not assert the proper DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOP behavior. I beleive that lack of discouragement to be mildly worrying but not a major security concern. Fixing the testing harnesses would allow us to properly implement DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS for CSV and add the corresponding test cases.",
