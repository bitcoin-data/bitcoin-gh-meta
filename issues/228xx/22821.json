For my use case, I tried to use `walletcreatefundedpsbt` with fully specified inputs and outputs, mostly for the purpose of modifying the outputs to achieve a certain fee rate for the transaction.  I define outputs with pre-fee amounts, then set `fee_rate` and `subtractFeeFromOutputs`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n\r\nThe RPC call should succeed and give me a PSBT where each output amount is a little less than the argument amount, to cover the fee.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\nThe call fails with \"Insufficient funds\".  If I use `getnewaddress` and fund an output paying to this address instead, the call works as expected.  The problem only appears when the output I am trying to spend is watch-only.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\nThis script demonstrates the problem in a minimal scenario: https://gist.github.com/GambolingPangolin/587c46e9e5421a5401973406a0869519\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core v0.21.1 downloaded from bitcoincore.org.\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\nUbuntu 20.04\r\n\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue? What is your operating system and its version? If Linux, what is your desktop environment and graphical shell? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n",
