I hope we can agree on two basic ideas:\r\n* The status-quo is harmful -- it allows for (messy) clustering of transaction origins. Which among other things can be used to further increase the accuracy of estimates if outputs are change or not\r\n* Certain wallets require the determinism that bip69 offers, while for other wallets it doesn't matter\r\n\r\nWhich I think leads to the logical conclusion that moving to (something like) bip69 is the smart thing -- even for wallets (perhaps like core) that don't really care too much about it. \r\n\r\nIf you are worried that core switching to bip69 could reduce privacy (which I don't think is a big concern, as several big wallets already are using bip69), there is an easy solution: it can slowly be phased in (e.g. seed a random number generator with the hash of the first priv key, then with a X% chance use bip69 or shuffle with inputs/outputs with the rng).\r\n\r\n> Of course testing it requires a bit more effort, but should you make your software worse so to save 10 lines of testing code?\r\n\r\nTesting improvements really is one of the smallest benefits of bip69, but you are really underselling it. For a wallet that uses bip69, if a transaction is ever created that doesn't conform -- then it's immediately obvious. You don't nearly have the same benefit with shuffled inputs/outputs -- where it would be very easy to have a wallet or code path that doesn't shuffle without anyone realizing.",

      "body" : "> Of course the assumption was Blockchain analysis knows the wallet the first transaction was taken with.\r\n\r\nOk, sure. In that case scenario `B` leaks which is the change. But knowing which wallet a transaction uses is hardly the common case, and the main purpose of this issue is to make it harder to find out ;D\r\n\r\n> Good luck getting CoinBase/other banks getting into Bitcoin to use BIP69\r\n\r\nIt doesn't requires 100% use to be greatly beneficial. And it's a lot more reasonable and easy to go \"everyone use bip69\" direction, then \"everyone use shuffling\" direction. \r\n\r\n> You need an SF for that, not a BIP. Which by the way, if you would want to propose this SF, I would support.\r\n\r\nI don't think a SF for this would be reasonable, especially without months (or years?!) notice. You could pretty easily force adoption though by making non-bip69 transactions non-standard. Of course the first step before that, is first achieving as wide-spread use of bip69 as possible.\r\n\r\n ",
