The fact that we never mark some invalid blocks as such prevents us from e.g. detecting and warning on invalid chains with significant work.\r\n\r\nThis change has `ProcessNewBlock` call `InvalidateBlock` on the invalid block to do the expected bookkeeping in `mapBlockIndex` before dropping the block.\r\n\r\nThis change also consolidates the setting of CBlockIndex's `nStatus |= BLOCK_FAILED_VALID` to a single function (`InvalidBlockFound`) since there's peripheral bookkeeping (e.g. `g_failed_blocks.insert()`) that we want to do consistently but is duplicated in some places or not done in other cases when it apparently should be. \r\n\r\n[One such replacement with InvalidBlockFound](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12407/files?diff=unified#diff-24efdb00bfbe56b140fb006b562cc70bL3420) ensures addition of invalid blocks to `g_failed_blocks` and so (in theory) reduces CPU burden when being spammed with descendants of an invalid block, since we no longer have to walk `mapBlockIndex` to determine its invalidity. Based on reading usage of `g_failed_blocks` I can't tell if this savings is real, but in any case it seems worthwhile to keep that set consistent (i.e. 1-1 with blocks marked BLOCK_FAILED_VALID since last restart).",
