More radically, the test could be refactored to make each of the different test parts a separate method, and have logging each time those methods are entered.\r\n\r\nIn this case, it's not too difficult to track down which iteration we're in, by looking back to the previous log message (\"Part 3: headers announcements can stop after large reorg, and resume after headers/inv from peer...\") and then following the test logic downwards. I can see that we're in the first iteration of the for loop, and we're failing because `check_last_announcement()` on line 387 expects all 8 of the new headers to be announced in a single headers message. In the logs, I see that the node is actually announcing the headers in one headers message with 6 headers, and a second headers message with 2 headers:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode0 2018-02-16 16:58:36.332323 SendMessages: 6 headers, range (23e5e7b1881996f8d6314f6e686bea8a2f370a79ec2b7bee950b18d88aa32a03, 46a36091bd29305f54fed32c0ef0a58e220efe4d875ec41180d42c149c328419), to peer=3 \r\n...\r\n node0 2018-02-16 16:58:36.334079 SendMessages: 2 headers, range (30a187a89de33c170b4c2c30f315c72d20f81061d2aeb022b63f08c02383a71d, 5ad6f44f33f1527d9ec7d711209698135aadff73e786052175f9460b73b56633), to peer=3\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it's perfectly legal for the node to send the new headers across multiple P2P messages, so we need to update `check_last_announcement()` to be tolerant of this.
