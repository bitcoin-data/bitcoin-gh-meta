It's not provided to me by `addmultisigaddress`. If I'm going to need it to sign transactions, then it should be.

If it finds that, it'll see a P2WSH program, and try to find which witness script the 256-bit hash corresponds to. If it finds that, it'll try to sign with it.\r\n\r\nYou're certainly right that right now the number of possible combinations is low, and it could just try all of them. I'm not convinced (either way) that this is the right approach though. It may become more complicated when more witness versions exist.\r\n\r\nIn any case, there's a clear shortcoming here and we should address it. `addmultisigaddress` should probbably return all redeemscripts involved, as just `listunspent` is not usable in your case (nor should it be needed).",

There should be a way to encapsulate all the information needed to sign (apart from the private key) out of addmultisigaddress and co, and pass it as a black box to signrawtransaction.\r\n\r\nI think either signrawtransaction should just infer it, or it comes in the form of a few more data fields to pass along.\r\n\r\n> Another potential change that would make my ugly workaround less ugly: provide a JSON list of pubkeys from decodescript, in addition to the addresses provided today.

Giving information about arbitrary scripts will likely become increasingly difficult as more private scripting techniques appear. The right place to analyse a particular script is by the person who created it. It can either come as a side effect out of `addmultisigaddress`. In 0.16, `validateaddress` on any address you created yourself will also include a full analysis, including redeemscripts and public keys used.\r\n",
