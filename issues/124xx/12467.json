It's surprising that this hasn't caused any issues yet.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid the fix is a big pile of autotools nonsense, but the changes are pretty straightforward:\r\n- Add a new macro to simplify passing args to subconfigures (univalue and secp256k1)\r\n- Pass our modified CXX down to univalue\r\n- If using depends, don't reset the values passed to subconfigures to their defaults\r\n\r\nThe good news is that this makes it much easier to tweak subconfigure args in the future.",
