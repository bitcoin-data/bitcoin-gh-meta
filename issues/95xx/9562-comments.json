For example, what should happen in the following scenario:\r\n\r\n- there's a current ban for subnet 1.2.3.0/24\r\n- there's whitelist configuration for 1.2.3.1\r\n\r\nshould we remove banning for the entire subnet? Or remove the ban for the subnet and add bans for all other address in the subnet? Or keep the subnet ban configuration?\r\n\r\nI'd prefer that the UI issue a warning if it detects that a configured whitelisted address is banned at startup. For example:\r\n\r\n\"1.2.3.4 is configured as a whitelist address, but is within banned subnet 1.2.3.0/24. To remove the ban, go to <place> and do <thing>\"",
