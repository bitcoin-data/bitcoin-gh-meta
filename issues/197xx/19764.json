   "body" : "This PR improves the robustness of our boost package in depends, most notably:\r\n1. Bumps boost from `1.70.0` to `1.71.0`, because `1.71.0`:\r\n\t1. Removes the need to patch out the unused variable.\r\n\t\thttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f8462a6d2794be728cf8550f45d19a354aae59cf/depends/packages/boost.mk#L36\r\n\t\tUpstream boost patched it out in https://github.com/boostorg/process/commit/d20b64cf37a773e452b84ce619752e3785be756c, which was first included in the `1.71.0` release\r\n\t2. Comes packaged with a version of `b2` which allows us to override its `CXX` and `CXXFLAGS`. Previously, choosing a toolset while building `b2` such as `clang` or `gcc` would force `b2`'s build system to invoke the compiler as a bare, hardcoded `clang` or `gcc`. However, our `depends` build system often want to customize this behaviour, adding extra flags or invoking the compiler by an alternate name. So this is useful.\r\n\t\t1. Commit where `CXX` was introduced: https://github.com/boostorg/build/commit/374f96516a6210687cdf63c987710501634bcac9\r\n\t\t2. Commit where `CXXFLAGS` was introduced: https://github.com/boostorg/build/commit/5d49abc1f291573d4bdcd2ee647b05a66f9c6497\r\n2. The boost package is now split into `native_b2` and `boost`, better representing what actually happens.\r\n\t- In our `depends` build system, we have a distinction between `native` packages and non-`native` packages. The output of `native` packages are meant to be used on the machine that's performing the build, and the output of non-`native` packages are meant to be used on/for the machine that will ultimately be running bitcoin. Previously, `boost` existed in `depends` as a non-`native` package, but that's partly inaccurate because the `./bootstrap.sh` invocation in its `$(package)_config_cmds` stage actually produced a binary called `b2`, which is run on the machine that's performing the build. This means that `b2` is a `native` package which is being built in an environment set up for the non-`native` package `boost`. This reveals a hidden unintended behavior in our `depends` build system: for linux->darwin cross builds, we use `gcc` for `native` packages, and `clang` for non-`native` packages. But `b2` was actually being built using `clang`, since it was being built in an environment set up for non-`native` packages.\r\n\r\ntheuni you might be interested in taking a look",
