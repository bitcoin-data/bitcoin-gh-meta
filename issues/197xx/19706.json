   "body" : "This PR improves the interfaces for the functions `EncodeBase58{Check}` by using Spans, in a similar fashion to e.g. PRs #19660, #19687. Note that on the master branch there are currently two versions of `EncodeBase58`: one that takes two pointers (marking begin and end) and another one that takes a `std::vector<unsigned char>` const-ref. The PR branch only leaves one generic Span-interface, both simplifying the interface and allowing more generic containers to be passed. The same is done for `EncodeBase58Check`, where only one interface existed but it's more generic now (e.g. a std::array can be directly passed, as done in the benchmarks).",
