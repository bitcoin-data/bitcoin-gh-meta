What is your operating system and its version?

Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n\r\nPR #13747 fixed the issue but it seems like the Python documentation incorrectly says that `is_closing()` was added to `BaseTransport` in 3.4.4 ([here](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio-protocol.html#asyncio.BaseTransport.is_closing)), but then on another page on the Python docs ([here](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/asyncio-protocol.html#asyncio.BaseTransport.is_closing)) it says it was included in Python 3.5.1. The previous fix was reverted when moving to 3.5, but it seems like that may have reintroduced the problem. I'm not sure how soon the minimum Python version will be increased, so not sure if fixing this is important.\r\n",
