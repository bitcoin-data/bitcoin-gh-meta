   "body" : "`fGetAddr` is an old flag that indicates an ongoing GETADDR/ADDR interaction. Introduced in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/dd519206a684c772a4a06ceecc87c665ad09d8be, it prevents further relay of received ADDR answers to other peers via the `RelayAddress()` gossip mechanism while set - probably to prevent ADDR traffic from being dominated by large GETADDR answers.Â \r\n\r\nIt also used to be possible to receive a large GETADDR answer spread over multiple ADDR messages (each bounded to max 1000 addresses), so the condition `if (vAddr.size() < 1000) pfrom.fGetAddr = false;` was meant to ensure that `fGetAddr` would only get cleared once the last ADDR of the package was received (typically with < 1000 addresses).\r\n\r\nHowever, `fGetAddr` currently does not work as originally intended and is no longer useful:\r\n- typically, the first ADDR we receive from a peer after sending the GETADDR is not the GETADDR response but the self-announcement of our peer. If this is the case, `fGetAddr` acts on it (preventing its relay) and is already inactivated once the GETADDR response is received.\r\n- Â https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/5cbf75324d1509a1262b65c5073314a4da3f6d77 introduced the condition `vAddr.size() <= 10`, so messages with more than 10 elements won't be relayed further regardless.\r\n- since #5419, we do not get more than one ADDR message in response to GETADDR because `vAddrToSend` cannot have more than 1000 elements. \r\n\r\nRemoving the flag will cause initial self-announcement from outbound peers to be gossip-relayed.\r\n\r\nThanks to jnewbery for help with reconstructing the history of `fGetAddr`!\r\n\r\n**[Outdated, but left in for context]**\r\nRemoving the flag will change behaviour in two special cases:\r\n1.) If the GETADDR response is exactly of size 1000, `fGetAddr` will not not be cleared on current master, so that the next \"regular\" ADDR message by this peer won't be relayed - this does not seem intentional, changing it arguably fixes a bug.\r\n2.) If the response to GETADDR is small  (<=10 addresses), it will be relayed to peers just as any other ADDR message of that size.",
