In that situation, the wallet is still recoverable by deleting all txs and rescanning.\r\n\r\nThis commit was originally part of #19457.\r\n\r\nOriginal motivation for this change was to avoid crashes with #19078, but a better fix for that problem is in #19793. This change is still beneficial because it removes an unsafe assert.",
