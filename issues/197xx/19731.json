   "body" : "This PR adds inbound peer eviction criteria `nLastBlockTime` and `nLastTXTime` to `CNodeStats` and `CNode::copyStats`, which then allows exposing them in the next commit as `last_transaction` and `last_block` Unix Epoch Time fields in RPC `getpeerinfo`.\r\n\r\nThis may be useful for writing missing eviction tests. I'd also like to add `lasttx` and `lastblk` columns to the `-netinfo` dashboard as described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19643#issuecomment-671093420.\r\n\r\nRelevant discussion at the p2p irc meeting http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2020-08-11.html#l-549:\r\n```text\r\n<jonatack> i was specifically trying to observe and figure out how to test https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19500\r\n<jonatack> which made me realise that i didn't know what was going on with my peer conns in enough detail\r\n<jonatack> i'm running bitcoin locally with nLastBlockTime and nLastTXTime added to getpeerinfo for my peer connections dashboard\r\n<jonatack> sipa: is there a good reason why that (eviction criteria) data is not exposed through getpeerinfo currently?\r\n<sipa> jonatack: nope; i suspect just nobody ever added it\r\n<jonatack> sipa: thanks. will propose.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last commit is optional, but I think it would be good to have logging in `rpc_net.py`.",
