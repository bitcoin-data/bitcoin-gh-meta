If you want to stop seeing a transaction, use `abandontransaction`.\n\nYeah, I don't think a transaction should ever completely disappear either. However `listsinceblock` takes a filter (since a block hash), which should filter both old confirmed transactions and old double-spends. \n\nThe normal usage of `listsinceblock` is you want to see what has happened since the last time you processed the transactions. So you should see all the double-spends that were attempted against you, and all the transactions that have confirmed, and all the unconfirmed transactions.  It's just you don't want to see the double-spends _forever_\n",
