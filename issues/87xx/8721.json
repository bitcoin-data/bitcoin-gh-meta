   "body" : "The [documentation of a compactSize field](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#compactsize-unsigned-integers) in the Bitcoin Developer Reference describes four possible encodings based on length. The ranges of integers expressible in each encoding overlap. Therefore it is possible in principle to represent a compactSize with a non-canonical encoding that uses more than the minimum number of bytes.\n\nThe actual implementation of [ReadCompactSize](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/serialize.h#L274) excludes this possibility. This is also [tested](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/test/serialize_tests.cpp#L215). However, it is not documented. Since it affects consensus, it should be documented.\n\n(Ref: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/842 , which is a potential security bug that the Zcash fork of Bitcoin would have had if canonicity were not enforced.)\n",
