For simplicity and to make correctness more obvious, we now enforce the minimal encoding, but I not believe \"it affects consensus\" aside from being a rule on the p2p network.\nStill, this should be filed at https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/ as that is where the documentation in question lives.\n",
