That guide shows the process on a Mac, but 7zip can be used on Linux if you don't have xar. Here is a link to the [script used in the video](https://gist.github.com/pudquick/ff412bcb29c9c1fa4b8d).\n\nI imagine it is easy from there to get the SDK once you have the Xcode.app. But still, people should stick with Xcode 7 until this process is formalized into the SDK extraction script and it has had testing to verify this works.\n",
