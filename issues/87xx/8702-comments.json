As the original author of `security-check.py` and `test-security-check.sh` I think my agreement to add an copyright header is most important, as I should have done that in the first place. The other changes, apart from @theuni's, who also agrees with the MIT license, are just typo and comment fixes so I'm fine with doing this without their agreement.\n\nSame for `share/qt/extract_strings_qt.py` - except that @luke-jr significantly contributed there too, but he agreed to in previous related pulls. So let's just move on here.\n",
