   "body" : "Currently a pruned node unsets NODE_NETWORK so most nodes shouldn't be requesting blocks from it.\n\nHowever, some nodes may not be so clever, and some people may hack their node to continue sending NODE_NETWORK for various reasons.\n\nIn these cases when a block is requested the node currently does nothing, and the requesting node needs to wait to timeout before attempting to request the block from a different node.\n\nIf notfound messages are sent instead this would allow nodes to be coded to detect this and immediately request the block from a different node, improving IBD speeds. (Some nodes may already have added this logic already).\n",
