      "body" : "re-ACK\n\nThe previous pull request went around and around in an ultimately circular discussion.  I disagree that the multi-balance situation is a blocker for this PR.  Multi-balance has existed since the beginning of bitcoin, in the form of confirmed/unconfirmed balance.  Add on top of that multi-sig.  On top of that, locked outputs.  Adding public-key-only to the wallet is elegant and does not overly complicate the existing multi-balance situation.\n\nThe alternatives only truly make sense if multi-wallet support is deployed and fleshed out, making it trivial to divide up your coins across wallets without restarts etc.  Otherwise, your choice is either running N copies of bitcoind -- in parallel if real-time wallet access is required, or this pull req.\n\nThat is the fundamental design choice.  We are not close to multi-wallet, and this PR has people actively using it.  This and coin control are two features that seem to continue to be requested, and IMO, need to be pushed based on user feedback.\n",

      "body" : "Hi guys,\n\nI'm investigating a problem where importaddress fails to find unspents sent to the imported address, even when rescan is set to true. I'm currently using https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/tree/watchonly, so I haven't tested with this latest rebase yet, but I wanted to bring this up ASAP incase this is an issue that has not yet been discovered.\n\nReproducing is pretty simple with a private testnet-in-a-box:\n\nImport an address:\n\n```\n$ bitcoind -datadir=2 importaddress mhou3jmi6Snxw4Y7nszn7gFTbUzHdiBt9y 'test' false\n```\n\nSend to that address from the mining process:\n\n```\n$ bitcoind -datadir=1 sendtoaddress mhou3jmi6Snxw4Y7nszn7gFTbUzHdiBt9y 1\n```\n\nConfirm the unspent has been sent:\n\n```\n$ bitcoind -datadir=2 listunspent 0\n[\n    {\n        \"txid\" : \"36016dffdfb5ca0d571f30349fa772123ac92be814c7945d6155869785e1f7d3\",\n        \"vout\" : 1,\n        \"address\" : \"mhou3jmi6Snxw4Y7nszn7gFTbUzHdiBt9y\",\n        \"account\" : \"test\",\n        \"scriptPubKey\" : \"76a91419249cd3bf74403fd1e918cc4cc07545b7b8cc2c88ac\",\n        \"amount\" : 1.00000000,\n        \"confirmations\" : 0,\n        \"spendable\" : false\n    }\n]\n```\n\nKill the second bitcoind, delete the wallet file, restart:\n\n```\n$ kill `cat 2/testnet3/bitcoind.pid`\n$ rm 2/testnet3/wallet.dat\n$ bitcoind -datadir=2 -daemon\n```\n\nReimport the address:\n\n```\n$ bitcoind -datadir=2 importaddress mhou3jmi6Snxw4Y7nszn7gFTbUzHdiBt9y 'test' true\n```\n\nLook for unspents, and they no longer appear:\n\n```\n$ bitcoind -datadir=2 listunspent 0\n[\n]\n```\n\nAny ideas/thoughts on this? I might have to disable wallet imports if I can't figure this one out soon.\n",

So, this is correct. It would be more clear if the method were renamed to CWallet::IsRelevant or something.\n- The NotifyAddressBoolChanged signal passes a bool along to indicate whether a destination is ours or not. If we wanted to distinguish in the GUI whether listed addresses of ours are considered spendable-from, then it may make sense to upgrade that bool to an isminetype, but that will depend on the GUI using it for something.\n",

Over 10,000 addresses have been imported, and a mere ~15 minutes after starting rescan we were ready to rock. Wallet balance is accurate - so it looks like rescan picked up everything without issue.\n\nThank you for putting this patch out there and considering(?) it for 0.9.0. Prior to this point, we were heavily dependent upon blockchain.info's rawaddr/total_received API function. With hot-button topics such as transaction malleability, MITM attacks, and further decentralization of the bitcoin network. It would be immensely useful to leverage watch-only (e.g. public keys only) wallets when integrating a web app with bitcoind.\n",

That isn't available right now, however, and will not work for all legacy systems anyway.\n\n@luke-jr Correct me if I'm wrong, of course.\n",

Instead, it's exactly the same idea as the `txindex`. You could have a flag to bitcoind when it starts as such:\n\n`utxoindex=1`\n\nSignaling that you would like this. Then, there could be an api call to retreive the current list of utxos for addresses:\n\n`getutxos <address> [confirmations]`\n\nOr something similar. It wouldn't be a wallet or related to the wallet code - it would just be an index of utxos, simple as that.\n\nDoes this satiate the concerns core has with the watchonly patch?\n",

It's also lead to stability issues when for example blockchain.info had a database issue and had to manually rescan their entire database. It's a really byzantine solution to the problem, one that is best handled by bitcoind IMHO and really could have nothing to do with the wallet code.\n",
