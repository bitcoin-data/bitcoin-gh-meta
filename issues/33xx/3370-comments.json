My intuition says that as long as you select one of the valid highest-pow chains, and there is no way to make a node switch to an equal-work chain when it already has one, we should always converge - but perhaps we need to think harder about that.\n\nIn any case, I like the rule \"the earliest seen of all highest-pow valid chains\".

I like having a clear rule about what the intended behavior is, and have that implemented.\n\nAfter having thought a bit about this, this is a case where the old and new implementation differ, IIRC:\n- The following setup exists: A->B and A->C. Now an orphan E is announced (with unknown parent D that builds on B), D is requested, but in the mean time block F (building on C) arrives. We switch to chain A->C->F in any case, but if now D arrives, and E turns out to be invalid, the old implementation would remain on A->C->F, while the new implementation will switch to A->B->D as D arrived before F.\n  I doubt this is the simplest scenario to trigger a difference, and it would surprise me if that was what PullTester observes.\n\nI still like the \"the earliest received of all valid maximal-PoW chains\" rule, as it's easy to implement and stateless. The current rules depend on what the current best chain is.\n",
