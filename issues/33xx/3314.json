   "body" : "It was pointed out to me that some people have made the mistake of sending coins to addresses which generated by their wallet prior to encryption simply because they're at the top of their address list and they were engaging in the bad practice of reusing addresses.\n\nIn GIT the receive interface does a much better job of discouraging reuse, but users still canâ and when they do they receive no guidance about which of their prior addresses were exposed by being left unencrypted.\n\nMight it be reasonable to have a set of flags that can show up in the list signifying addresses which are \"exposed\" meaning that they date from a prior encryption key?\n\nLikewise, I know of at least one incident where a user randomly picked a key they'd imported from a third party as a key to receive funds and the funds were stolen, a flag indicating that the key was imported would have been helpful.\n\nAlong these lines, if we ever get around to having a auto-sweeping feature, might it make sense to have a \"this wallet is compromised\" button that rekeys, forces a backup, and then marks all existing addresses as compromised which flags them for automatic sweeping?\n",
