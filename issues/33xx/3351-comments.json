Bitcoin-qt, in contrast with Armory, is very much unsuited for offline usage.\n\nWe'll also need deterministic wallet support, otherwise the printed backup will be out of date as soon as it's printed.\n\nAlso: many printers these days are networked (allowing interception on the wire), or store printed pages (if only for a while). \n",
