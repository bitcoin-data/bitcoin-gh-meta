So getting one step closer really doesn't get us any closer...\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am for out-of-tree builds as well. But the other devs voiced at the time of the autotools merge that the cost of maintaining the leveldb list wasn't worth the benefits of out-of-tree builds. Maybe that's changed. Anyone else care to chime in?\n\nThe cost is maintaining a list of all source/header files necessary for us to build leveldb. This list would only change when a new version is imported. The benefit is being able to ./configure and make from a folder outside of the source dir, so that the source dir may be left untouched.\n",

Without --verbose, it shuts up unless an error occurs, and the only lines printed are warnings or errors.  That nicely highlights the several warnings that do occur in autoreconf, which got lost in the noise with --verbose.\n",
