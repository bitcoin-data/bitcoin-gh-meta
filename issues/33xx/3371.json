   "body" : "Using change addresses cause a lot of problems, and don't have much benefit. The problems:\n- High learning curve - newbies don't know where their money is going. When they make a payment, they see their entire address drained of money on the blockchain.\n- Backing up your bitcoins becomes almost impossible. This is really the biggest problem with using change addresses, and it is a HUGE problem. How do you back up your money if your addresses are drained every time you use them? If you want to back up an address, you can do that easily. Just encrypt your wallet and copy it to various devices (your phone, external HD, USB drive, paper wallet, etc). If change addresses are used tho, you must copy to all your backups (as painful as printing out a new paper wallet) every time you make a transactions. That is intractable.\n\nThat intractability I think is a HUGE problem for bitcoins. People need a simple, understandable secure way of being \"their own bank\" and change addresses make bitcoins broken for most people.\n\nYou can use seeded address generators, and back up the seed. But there are no standard algorithms for doing that. If you find your seed in 30 years, how will you know what algorithm to use to use the seed on? You'd have to back up the algorithm with your seed. That's really hard on paper. \n\nIts in the best interests of bitcoin and bitcoins users to have a simple way to back up their money. It doesn't make sense to make backing up bitcoins far more complicated just to gain a little bit of privacy, especially when the technique [probably doesn't even work](http://anonymity-in-bitcoin.blogspot.com/2011/07/bitcoin-is-not-anonymous.html). Don't gear this currency toward power user - let power users use advanced features when they understand them.\n",
