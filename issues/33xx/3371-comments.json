I don't mind my issue being closed once a consensus has been reached, but 30 minutes is not long enough for that to happen. Please indulge me with the knowledge that if my idea isn't reasonable it will be very clear within a week. \n\nAlso, I think you misunderstood me when I said there is no \"standard\". You have clearly done excellent work in creating an algorithm for doing this, but that doesn't make it a standard. The fact that it is a proposal at the moment means it is definitely nowhere near a standard. The importance of a standard is that people will be able to easily find ways of restoring their wallets in the future. By contrast, an encryption standard like AES would be all that's needed to safely store a bitcoin private key, and by proxy a user's money if change addresses weren't used. Your BIP is nowhere near the level of standard that AES is.\n\nI would appreciate some justification for the use of change addresses here. Please don't just dismiss this issue without some discussion. I'd also appreciate links to this type of discussion if you're aware of where it has taken place before.\n",

It may well be the case that HD wallets will have staying power for a few decades, but there's nothing to ensure that - especially when (it sounds like) no program has actually implemented it yet. \n\nLearning about the proposal though, it sounds pretty nice and solves most of the problems I've been worried about. I still think that bitcoin needs to have a well established way to keep coins safe in the long run without any monitoring. A person should be able to back up a wallet, throw it in a time capsule, and someone in 50  years should be able to open it up and use the wallet. To me, this means that whatever algorithm is used to generate the right private keys should be identifiable and findable 50 years later just by looking at the backup. \n\nI know for a fact that if you stored a plain bitcoin address private key and threw it in a time capsul that labeled it \"bitcoin address\" - someone in 50 years could open it and use it. Is this true for your proposal? It would feel really sucky for people if they back up their stuff, and 5 years from now open it up and can't figure out how generate the right addresses from it. I don't want bitcoin to erode away because its too easy for people to lose their coins.\n\nWould you mind pointing me to somewhere where the efficacy of change addresses has been discussed?\n",
