First I tried approaches like\n\n```\nconfirmed = bitcoind_api.getbalance('*', 1)\ninc_unconfirmed = bitcoind_api.getbalance('*', 0)\nunconfirmed = inc_unconfirmed - confirmed\n```\n\nand several variations. But this was not working like intended. If I remember correctly the problem was that outgoing transactions, while being unconfirmed, are still taken into account with the getbalance methods, leading to wrong results.\nCompared with messing around with the getbalance method (including the non-intuitive account handling...) the new \"getunconfirmedbalance\" method seems quite straightforward and does exactly what it says.\n",
