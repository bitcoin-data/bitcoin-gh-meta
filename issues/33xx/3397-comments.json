Google for it, there have been quite some proposals. IIRC there will need to be changes to the P2P protocol. You may want to ask deeper technical questions like this on the stack exchange, if it isn't asked there yet.\n\nIn practice running a full node requires quite some resources, and this is more likely to become worse than better in the short term.\n\nIf that is a problem currently your only option is to run a SPV client.\n",
