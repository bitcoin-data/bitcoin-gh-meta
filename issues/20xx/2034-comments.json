I really want an IBD mechanism that at least is continuously downloading blocks, and doesn't stop for several minutes when a peer disconnects or the mechanism is disturbed for some silly reason. Seriously, the way it works now is embarrassing. However, just adding re-requests and randomly asking a new peer for blocks when an old one doesn't response would increase the double-block-download problem significantly, thus this is better solved as well at the same time.\n\nYou raise a good point that there are several issues with how Bitcoin's network core works now, but IMHO that is a much harder problem to solve.\n",

I struggle sometimes to relay information that I know about but that others do not. #1271 on first appearance does look like it fixes the problem in the wrong place, and I understand why people might think that. For the problem you mention, it does, and a different pull request should be made to fix that particular problem in the right place (for which #1271 does not). However, #1271 is needed as a pre-requisite for another pull request I will be making in the future, which will cause the node to re-request blocks from other peers when the current peer providing the block becomes stuck or stale. If it became stuck rather than stale and therefore unsticks, it will of course then start sending a block which will by then have already been received by the other node. In that situation, #1271 will then be needed. I could include it as a commit in the other pull which I talk about, but I firmly believe it makes more sense to issue that functionality now as it is currently needed now also. Hope this explains things and my logic so far.\n",
