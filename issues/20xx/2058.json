Previously, a cache per block connect or disconnect action was used, so blocks could not be applied in a partial way. Extend this to a cache for the entire reorganisation, making it atomic entirely. This also simplifies the code a bit.\n\nI haven't seen any reports of problems because of this, but it should be fixed.\n",
