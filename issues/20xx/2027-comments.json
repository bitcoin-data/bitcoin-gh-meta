Anyway me and a lot of other people are using 5.1 and will continue to use 5.1 so expect your wallets to be obsolete in good time you will have to transfer your balance to a new wallet.\n",

Recent Ubuntu releases do not have dev files for 4.8 anyway, so you'll need to find them in a backport or install them manually. Again, no problem to use a different version if you want.\n\nAlso, the long term plan is to get rid of BDB altogether, which has these terrible compatibility problems between versions.\n",
