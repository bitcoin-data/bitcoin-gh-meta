This allowed fixing both issues at once, as we already internally and on the P2P network use IPv6 everywhere.\r\n\r\nI2P and cjdns cannot use this method, as their addresses are too large to fit in IPv6. Garlicat exists for mapping i2p into IPv6, but it requires an external lookup service to convert garlicat addresses to ful I2P addresses. I don't know phantom.\r\n\r\nIf we want to support more types of networks, the first step is probably adding something like a CExtNetAddr, which represents either a CNetAddr or some address in another network. The connection/proxy logic could easily support that.\r\n\r\nFor relaying, such a CExtNetAddr would need to become part of the P2P protocol. Maybe we wish to push for that at some point, but probably together with other improvements like host keys and authenticated connections.",
