Deleting them does not cause any harm to the wallet itself.\n\nSo I don't understand the second point, \"if one of your receive coins addresses is in your Address book, it is possible to delete it AND it disappears from your RECEIVE coin list\".   First, addresses are either in the address book or receive coin list, secondly, there are safeguards at multiple levels that prevent receive addresses from being deleted.\n\nCan you give steps on how to accomplish this? How do you get receiving address in your address book in the first place?\n",

BUT one  \"receiving address went missing\"\n\nAll I know is , that i had the address book open and I was deleting two addresses I did not need, but on selecting one then pressing the delete, there was a delay and when it finally completed 3 were missing.\nOne of which was a \"loop\" receive address I use for testing , that loops back to me.\n\nWhen I went back to my \"receive coin\" list,  the loop back address was missing.\n\nI have just re-opend the program again, to test it, but now I find that whereas before, there was only one entry left in the\"address book\" (I had 4.. 3 got deleted one was left)\nNow I find there are TWO left!!!, and there was definatly one on shutdown, because I remember thinking \"oh Sh*\\* there is only one address left\"\n\nThe only other way this could be explained, is if the system was storing keypresses with a screen lag.\nI.E in my address book it looked like 3 had been deleted, but only two had been, and when I switched tab to \n\"receive coin\" then one address was deleted from there.\n\nIt all sounds highly convoluted, but how else to understand why  one  address has appeared in the address book, but one has gone from the receive coins addresses.\n\nin view of this, I'm not going to pay about when the blocks are syncing.\n",
