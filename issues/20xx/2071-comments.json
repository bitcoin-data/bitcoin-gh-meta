However, that doesn't mean that the conversion to JSON should happen there.\n\nFor example, if CWallet and CWalletTx had a cleaner interface for requesting information, this could reduce duplication between RPC and GUI. However, that probably means something a thin layer in between of data structure to represent information extracted from and sent to the wallet. The GUI would inspect these structure and convert them to GUI elements, the RPC would inspent them and convert to JSON.\n",
