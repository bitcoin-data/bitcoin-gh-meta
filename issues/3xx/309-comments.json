Making sure that re-reading and re-applying the config file correctly changes the internal state is going to be very difficult, and may lead to all kinds of weird edge cases.\r\n\r\nI think a more realistic ask is adding support to change the specific individual config options through RPC methods.\r\n\r\nI'm concept NACKish on this. Not because I don't think it's a useful idea, but because I think it's just too difficult to get right.\r\n\r\nI suggest we close this with 'up for grabs'.",
