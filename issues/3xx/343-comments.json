      "body" : "I believe this would open up a denial-of-service attack.\n\nThe problem is that sending ANY response over an SSL connection starts the SSL handshake. So the attack scenario is:\n\nAttacker connects to your node (and they're not from -rpcallowip address).\nYou're running -ssl=1, so start ssl handshake to return 403 response.\nAttacker doesn't respond... your rpc process must wait -rpctimeout seconds before proceeding.\n\nJust dropping the connection immediately prevents the attack. Being \"a proper HTTP implementation\" is not high on the bitcoin wish list.\n",
