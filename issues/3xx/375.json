I personally\nthink he's full of crap. It doesn't matter. We are locked into one hashing\nalgorithm and this sort of rumour exposes a weakness that we needn't have.\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\niEYEAREDAAYFAk4QLG8ACgkQ2p+H2HZY90HiEgCfYvQZYdsHJUT4aEasuqLlEFHi\nrVwAmwcSs9WyumpJq4y8bnRXOXOsq+x8\n=TCoE\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n",
