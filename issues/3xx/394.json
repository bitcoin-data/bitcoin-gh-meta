   "body" : "I'm pull-requesting this so that people know this stuff exists.\nConsider it as low priority, and If there's some interest in it, I might keep this up to date for some time.\n\nPluses:\n- Command line and configuration files are fully parsed before being taken into account, errors are reported (including misspelled or unknown parameters).\n- A nice interface is provided to access options & configuration from source code (cf. option.h).\n- Single definition of options and default values, which have been moved to the top of .cpp files.\n- Checks for integer overflows in configuration values.\n- New rpc command \"reloadconfig\" to dynamically update configuration parameters (Issue #309). Command line parameters will not be overridden. Notice that many core parameters are used only during startup.\n- Option -conf is now enough to configure everything (Issue #140).\n- A way to force listing of hidden options (-help=allopts) and access to help messages is possible even if bitcoin is already running.\n- Fix erroneous error message with respect to the path of the configuration file when using -testnet (Issue #241).\n- Removed '\\n' and other data from translatable strings (Issue #313).\n- Using boost to deal with most filesystem paths.\n- Slightly faster access to configuration values (no map lookups).\n\nMinuses:\n- Access to configuration values are a bit less recognizable in source code.\n- Relies a little deeper on boost (but without added dependencies).\n- Uses some hacks around boost::program_options to recover original bitcoin command line style.\n\nNotes:\n- This has been tested a little bit on unix (linux), needs to be tested on other arches (Windows).\n",
