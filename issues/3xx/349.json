   "body" : "To delete the signature from scriptSig, OP_CHECKSIG constructs a new\nCScript object from the signature found on the stack and then looks for\nan exact copy of this object in scriptSig.\n\nHowever, if the original signature was pushed using OP_PUSHDATA and the\nsignature is short enough to be pushed using one of the 1-75 opcodes,\nthe two objects will not match and the signature verification will fail\neven though the values are the same.\n\nThis patch fixes this by comparing the data-pushing opcode's payload\nonly (excluding the opcode itself).\n\nI've tested this with valid testnet transactions, which are verified\ncorrectly.\n\nAs this is my first bitcoin patch and it touches a rather sensitive part of the code, please review/test it for yourselves as well!\n",
