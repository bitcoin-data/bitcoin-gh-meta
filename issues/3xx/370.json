You click on backup and it prompts you with which drive do you want to save the wallet.dat as wallet-yyyymmddhhmmss.dat ?\nWith big red warnings that the backup file is not encrypted,  the same care must be taken with it as with a real life wallet full of cash. And that if you have no backups and your hard drive dies, you have lost your wallet, with little chance of recovering it.\n\nInstead of people magically knowing where to go to find their current wallet.dat file.\nWindows: C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\Application Data\\Bitcoin\n(AKA)       %APPDATA%\\Bitcoin\nMac      : ~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin\nUnix      : ~/.bitcoin\n\nBert\n",
