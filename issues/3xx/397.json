   "body" : "The current Windows icon goes up to 48x48, which is fine on XP, but it lacks the large resolutions supported and encouraged by Vista and 7.\n\nI'm willing to fix this, but I need to get my hands on a high resolution copy of the current icon, which I have been unable to locate. Alternatively, I can use [one created by bitboy](http://forum.bitcoin.org/?topic=1756.0) or the [bitcoin.org logo](http://forum.bitcoin.org/?topic=1631.0) as source material.\n",
