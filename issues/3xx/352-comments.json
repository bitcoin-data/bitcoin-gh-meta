I've basically run out of obvious automated testing at this point.\n\nI am, however, unable to do GUI testing, so I hope and assume other people are beating on that.  \n\nTo the best of my ability to determine this is now ready for mainline and testing by a broader audience.\n\nI think that before release the wallettools probably need to be updated to support this: both as an additional validation of the implementation, but also so that there isn't a gap in recovery tools, but I don't see any reason that should block mainlining it.\n",
