Also an external implementation would require apis for importing/exporting transactions, and wouldn't e.g. have access to the wallet keys and address book. Seems ugly to me.\n\n The api/cli presented in this patch is nice (well, the redeem needs to also support sendmany redemptions).  Obviously a GUI for this would take a bit more workâ and might reasonably wait until there are some examples of the functionality being used to inform the design.\n",

No need to compile with GUI, add all the object files and ensure that we get the correct main().\n\n@sacarlson - looks very interesting\n",

To increase visibility into the signature collection process, the latest commit adds the list of addresses that have signed the tx to the output of the RPC call.\n\nThe latest commit also refactors the script Solver function so it can be used to check more complex scripts that include repeated segments.  multisign now uses this facility to perform exact script matching.  This prevents an attacker from fooling the user into thinking a tx is protected when it is put fully under the control of the attacker by a maliciously crafted script.\n",

For example with sender and receiver keys Ks, Kr, a coin with scriptSig (Ks AND K1) OR (Kr AND K2) could be redeemed by sender if private key for K1 is broadcast or by receiver if private key for K2 is broadcast.  \n\nShould I wait with disjunctions until after this pull is decided, or should I add now?\n\nThe other question is whether to go with CHECKMULTISIG.  Right now I have padding to get around the GetSigOpCount check.  I just noticed that CheckBlock uses that, so we won't really be able to change GetSigOpCount anytime soon (and my change to reduce the MULTISIG count from 20 to 5 has to be reverted).

Instead of bringing two elements to the front, one suffices:\n- n=0:\n- n=1: SWAP\n- other: [n] ROLL\n  Followed by a simple: [pubkey] CHECKSIG\n\nIf an address or pubkey is present more than once in the expression, put its evaluation logic (together with the corresponding expected position of input arguments) in front. Each time it is used in the RPN processing, use [m] PICK to retrieve its evaluation, except the last time, when you use [m] ROLL.\n",

Each is either\n- an address check with matching stack depth\n- a pubkey check with matching stack depth\n- an [m] PICK or [m] ROLL with m<n (n = stack depth)\n- a supported RPN operator (small number, ADD, BOOLAND, BOOLOR, comparison operators)\n  When the entire script can be decomposed into these components, and the final stack depth is 1, the script is valid/standard.\n\nTo actually solve such scripts in general, you'll indeed want to convert to RPN again, but that can be postponed.\n\nPS: shame on me; i was talking about reverse polish notation, but somehow started using the abbreviation \"RPL\"...\n",
