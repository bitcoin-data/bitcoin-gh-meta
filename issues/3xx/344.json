   "body" : "HI!\n\nI'm one of the founders of Bitcoins.lc - we're experiencing some problems with bitcoind as a backend.\nThe error consists of mainly that the amount of connections between bitcoind and pushpoold is insane.\n\nThis is due to the fact the bitcoind does not support keep-alive for RPC-connections. pushpoold is based upon libcurl and should be able to do so out of the box. Each new getwork request from clients opens up a new connection between bitcoind and pushpoold to transfeer data.\n\nCould anyone please take a look at this problem?\nI'd gladly pay 10 BTC for implementing a keep-alive patch for bitcoin.\n\n/ jim\n",
