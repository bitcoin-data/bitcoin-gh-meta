      "body" : "Thanks for the feedback! I'm not sure about your suggestion of providing a raw transaction. I aim at something that is suitable for automated use, but at the same time users can still realistically use manually. It is not clear what exactly do you mean by \"here's a transaction\" - would you like something like, say:\n\n```\n{ \"in\": [ { \"prev_out\": { \"hash\": \"...\", \"n\": \"...\" } } ], \"out\": [ { \"value\": ..., \"address\": \"...\" } ] }\n```\n\nThere is a couple of questions here:\n- Identify prev_outs by specific n's instead of account-based autoselection (answer to your last question: all txouts claimable by the given account are selected). Maybe this really is the best way to go, but then gettransaction and listtransactions output needs to include an 'n' field too.\n- Switch syntax from two-object form to tx-like form. I don't see the benefit, IMO it just leads to a more baroque syntax.\n\nI'm all for switching to explicit n-form for inputs, but how to integrate this with the account system then? Currently, each transaction has single strFromAccount. Should the user still specify the account and the input amount just gets subtracted from that account's balance and it's the user's responsibility to sort out the account balance?\n\nI agree that the duplicated code is bad. I was a bit shy to do large changes in CreateTransaction(), but I will refactor this part of code and I agree it will make the code better. I just want to agree on the final way to select inputs first.\n",
