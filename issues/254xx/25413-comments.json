If so, there is nothing we can do. Usually the issue tracker is used to track technical issues related to the Bitcoin Core code base. To get support for other software you'll have to ask them.\r\n\r\nGeneral bitcoin questions and/or support requests are best directed to the [Bitcoin StackExchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com) or the `#bitcoin` IRC channel on Libera Chat.",
