   "body" : "The current build example has two issues:\r\n\r\n1. The claim that the wallet functionality will be missing is obsolete since Bitcoin Core can use SQLite, which is a hard dependency of `pacman` so we can assume that it's always present. \r\n2. Installing package groups such as `base-devel` adds some friction and uncertainty by forcing readers to choose which packages they need, interactively. Listing required deps explicitly speeds up the whole process, makes it more transparent and cuts the number of installed packages.",
