   "body" : "Putting space between greater-than signs is a pre-C++11 thing and\r\nthere are already instances of not doing so in the code base so\r\nlet's normalize this bit and just remove the extra space.\r\n\r\nFor example [this](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9edc5133d49978db75cf68be1a2046236c007d9f/src/addrman.cpp#L319) already uses `>>` and there are some more examples on the code base.\r\n\r\nTo me seeing a code still avoids `>>` is a distraction as makes me to recheck whether the code base still supports pre-C++11 which clearly isn't the case here.\r\n\r\nI already have seen the notes about refactoring in `developer-notes.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `stylistic code changes are usually rejected.` and am ready to close this PR immediately and voluntarily as the first unhappy comment, I just thought it is a common distraction for code reading keeping a historical and obsolete thing inconsistently around but if you are happy to keep it this way it's just ok.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
