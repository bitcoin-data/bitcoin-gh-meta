EvalScript receives a nHashType parameter but it's only used for checking it is the same as the ones contained at the end of the signatures. As shown in #4555, it is almost always called with a 0 which makes CheckSig ignore the check and just use what's contained at the end of the signature.\nI'm still struggling to understand why there can be different sighashes for the same script/output and why they're are placed after the signatures instead of somewhere else. Sipa's \"ask Satoshi\" it's not a satisfactory answer to me... \n\nI'm also still thinking what good be a way to benchmark this...\n",

I found a potential optimization instead, what I wanted to do was to serialize the transaction previously for each script evaluation, but @sipa pointed out that the transaction serialization depends on the sighash and this was the best you can do.  \nIf the sighash was known and equal for each input, we could replace parameters \"const CTransaction& txTo, unsigned int nIn\" with \"uint256 hash\" in VerifyScript.\nThat would be a hardfork now, I know, but I see no functional drawbacks.\nSo I will consider this a design flaw unless someone convinces me that Satoshi had thought this in ways I haven't that make his decision better.\n",
