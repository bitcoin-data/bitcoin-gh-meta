   "body" : "Currently the Bitcoin source code relies on assertions (because they may have side effects), and some compile-time and runtime settable consistency checks.\n\nThis leads to a few odditiies:\n- Failing to build with -NDEBUG\n- Uncertainty what performance impact consistency checks have.\n- Conflict between the 'asserts are good because it tests the assumptions you're relying on hold'/'better fail than have undefined behavior' and 'asserts are bad because if they're exploitable they're potentially a massive DoS to the network'.\n\nThis leads to only limited assert usage (because you don't want them for anything potentially exploitable), and a few very expensive optional consistency checks (-checkmempool, DEBUG_LOCKORDER, ...).\n\nMy proposal:\n- Add a -checks command-line flag which enables inexpensive consistency checks.\n- Enable -checks by default in debug builds, but not in release/gitian builds.\n- Add a safe CHECK() macro which\n  - always evaluates its arguments\n  - is a no-op without -checks but like assert() with -checks.\n- Get rid of all assert()s.\n",
