I think the only way to resolve this is to remove IsStandard from the policy entirely (and hope enough nodes continue to run with this policy). This is potentially very dangerous.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it appears an attacker can flood the network with double-spends in order to rate limit relaying of some of them.
