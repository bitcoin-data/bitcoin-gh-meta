For example, bitcoinj supports TOR natively. Not sure about Electrum.\n\nDo mind that SPV clients inherently leak some information about your addresses through the bloom filters that they submit. But behind TOR that may matter less. At most the adversary can correlate which addresses belong together, not whom they belong to.\n",

There is no reason why you couldn't run a full node on the open net, and use another SPV wallet that is not pointed at your own full node, but connects to peers over TOR.\n\nThere is your separation, and much more water-tight than trying to handle it in the same process with some hacky exceptions and rules (remember kids, opsec is very hard to get right).\n\nSo I'm closing this.\n",
