Every transaction paying to that address, will be credited to the account. But sending from that address, does Not debit the account. To debit an account, there are 3 rpc-calls:\n- move\n- sendfrom\n- sendmany\n\nNote, that using sendfrom and sendmany can choose coins from Any address in your wallet, its just, that the value being sent will be deducted from the account balance.\nSo account-balances do not necessarily correspond with the underlying coins in the blockchain.\n\nSee: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Accounts_explained\n",

When you send coins using 'sendfrom', coins are subtracted from the provided account.\n\nThis ledger does not correspond in any way to the block chain. Coins can be arbitrarily moved between accounts with the 'move' command, which is purely an internal operation.\n\nThis means that after initially receiving coins there is no correspondence between the accounts and how many coins are 'on' the addresses.\n\nThe ledger does not influence coin selection when you send coins. No matter whether you use sendfrom, sendmany or other send functions, the coin selection chooses from all coins (unless you use 'coin control' in the GUI).\n\nMany people get confused by the account system and it is probably the worst code in all of Bitcoin Core. For this reason and others it is planned to be removed in a future version, see #3816.\n",
