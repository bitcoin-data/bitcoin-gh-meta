Yes.  Goal should be to turn on as much inexpensive runtime checks as possible, always.\n- Related goal, make checks as inexpensive as possible, so as to not punish the user (and therefore encourage the user to want to turn off the checks).\n- Can use the compiler's branch prediction hints (likely/unlikely macros)\n- Related, make debugging/diagnostic dumps easy for the user to trigger\n\nCheap runtime checks are good.

What I'm saying is that in production environments, it may be better to not risk blowing up the process due to an overeager check, as that automatically means a huge risk to the network if that assert is triggerable by a network condition. If it's based on a relayable message, it may even wipe out the network entirely.\n\nWhat I want is more of these checks, more as a way for the programmer to say \"this is what I assume here\", more than \"if this doesn't hold here, we're in BIG trouble\". It makes the code clearer, and simultaneously verifies that such assumptions hold. But only in cases where we're not at risk of hurting the network by dying.\n\nI don't have a good answer for what to do when things are clearly blowing up. Perhaps the checks that we are _really_ sure about indicate irrecoverably bad state and _really_ sure cannot be triggered by the network can remain asserts, but I'd rather see them turned off in production if that means we can have more checks in the code.\n",

Everyone will test with the debug build, and then problems appear in the release build which no one has tested before the actual release :-) Also having a build that intentionally strips sanity checks makes troubleshooting harder. So yes, run-time instead of compile-time disabling is preferable where possible.\n\nSo for critical checks we should have an 'assert' that ignores NDEBUG.\n",
