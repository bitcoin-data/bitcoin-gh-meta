Personally I'd prefer to have clock sync as just a local problem. A mechanism such as this should be used to warn, not correct. If your time is wrong, fix it. Wrong clocks cause all kinds of issues on a system.\n\n(this excludes drift over time due to oscillators which is outside the user's control, of course, but correcting for that requires a more advanced algorithm and as said by @gmaxwell is not required in our case as we don't need time to be very precise...)\n",

If the computer is setup to sync with NTP, good, if not, then good too. I think it is a good idea to bail if the machine has an offset of more than, say five or ten minutes with respect to the median time of peers it is attempting to connect to.\n\nThese are some potential attacks:\n- Malicious NTP server can isolate the machine and serve a separate version of the blockchain (already a risk currently, if enough nodes agree on the bad time, regardless of network offset calculation)\n- Malicious NTP server can deny the machine a connection no the Bitcoin network (offset too large, a risk with current scheme too)\n- Offset could make machine reject a block (this is already a risk on current scheme)\n- Offset may prevent the machine from connecting to the Bitcoin network (already a risk)\n\nThere surely are some attack vectors that I have not considered. But these that I could come up with are already affecting the current client, even with all the network offset calculation stuff. We could make the code simpler and still run the same level of risk.\n",

E.g. if you have 5 peers claiming ten seconds off, then six more connect claiming 80 minutes. You'll apply a correction of 0 instead of 10 seconds. Perhaps better to just fix in another PR, since it was an existing misbehavior (though more likely to be triggered when the time is cut down to small numbers).\n",

While it works well to cover some cases of misconfigured clocks, it fails to detect others.\r\n\r\nThen, replace it with a stronger warning mechanism that also triggers when the time is off by more than ~10 minutes? Currently it only triggers after 70 minutes.\r\n\r\nMaybe even add setting (off by default) that shuts down the node if outbound nodes report a different time than ours?\r\n\r\nEdit: This is probably roughly the idea from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4521#issuecomment-54685781",
