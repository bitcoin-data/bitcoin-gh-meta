In light of this exposure this\n+document establishes some basic expectations for the expectations\n+for the operation of dnsseeds.\n+\n+0. A DNSseed operating organization or person is expected\n+to follow good host security practices and maintain control of\n+their serving infrastructure and not sell or transfer control of their\n+infrastructure. Any hosting services contracted by the operator are\n+equally expected to uphold these expectations.\n+\n+1. The DNSseed results must consist exclusively of fairly selected and\n+functioning Bitcoin nodes from the public network to the best of the\n+operators understanding and capability.\n+\n+2. For the avoidance of doubt, the results may be randomized but must not\n+single-out any group of hosts to receive different results unless due to an\n+urgent technical necessity and disclosed.\n+\n+3. The results may not be served with a DNS TTL of less than one minute.\n+\n+4. Any logging of DNS queries should be only that which is necessary\n+for the operation of the service or urgent health of the Bitcoin\n+network and must not be retained longer than necessary or disclosed\n+to any third party.",
