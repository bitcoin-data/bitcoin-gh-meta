      "body" : "A couple thoughts:\n\nWhen changing existing code we must not just trust clang-format repeatability to verify that no bugs were introduced, we should test via checks for identical object files. This will take a little effort because some macros insert line numbers, and these will need to be bypassed.\n\nTo use clang format normativeily we must end up specifying a particular version that all contributors must use, as clang format changes its behavior. This is irritating, and disruptive to contributing.  It could be made much better with good automation like cfield's depbuilder work, to help people get a particular version of clang-format; though due to the flowing API breakage in C++ code, I don't know how long an older version will be maintainable.\n\nAnother concern is which style to specify. The most common behavior in Bitcoin Core today has stylistic elements which have been objectively shown to increase software defect rate and confuse review-- e.g. unbraced multi-line IFs.  We should not make any disruptive reformating changes unless we are quite confident that the style is what we want to live with.\n\nWe could avoid disrupting the workflow of existing patches by only reformatting (and then requiring it) on new files and substantial rewrites.  I think that would be a better path.\n\nTo the extent that there is hope to address bikeshedding via this, I beg anyone thinking that to give up that thought.  Bikeshedding is not a result of any particular coding style or consistency, bikeshedding arises from a lack of perspective which can only be addressed by experience, community norms, and having more important things to worry about.\n\nStylistic consistency has actual benefits; it aids newcomers in their contributions because it is easier for them to make sure their work is okay on styleistic grounds; though this may be offset by having to install some particular version of clang-format before they can get started. It eases review because the uniformity creates better expectations; but reformating makes looking at the history harder, which harms review. Good style choices (as opposed to merely consistent) have, at times, been shown to lower defect rates in software-- but there is not a universal opinion on what choices are good.  So there are benefits to be had, but they must be carefully managed with other risks and costs.  And the magnitude of the potential benefits, I think, are enough to say that this subject should have a very low priority in general.\n",

Imagine changes to critical code, refactor-only or just a new feature whose PR aims to produce a simple diff that is easy to read and to verify. Often clean diffs and proper formatting are orthogonal.\n\nEntirely new files are the exception but they should ideally be formatted before submitting the PR (at least prior to merging).\n",
