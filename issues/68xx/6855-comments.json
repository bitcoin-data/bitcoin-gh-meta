The RPC interface is all bitcoind has as a stable interface. Even if the wallet is to move to a separate process (which has been said many times before, but there are no concrete plans by anyone to work on this, so acting based on it makes little sense). \r\nPractically this means having to maintain two interfaces for a long time, handle bugs that come up, as well as review changes to them. As REST is growing all the time this feels like terrible scope creep.\r\n",
