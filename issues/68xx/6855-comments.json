This is increasingly out of scope.\n\nDisagree to use RPC. Current RPC implementation is inefficiency. If we tend going towards the \"wrapper-approach\" and supporting one core interface, we should use something more efficient like ZMQ/TCP (with package transmission guarantee). We currently follow the JSON RPC 2.0 standard which is inefficient for some bitcoin datastructures (blocks, large transactions).\n\nSupporting a core access (bidirectional) over ZMQ would also allow to split off the RPC server (which \nwould also be a nice step regarding process separation).\n",

If we tend going towards the \"wrapper-approach\" and supporting one core interface, we should use something more efficient like ZMQ/TCP (with package transmission guarantee). \n\nThis discussion is tangential, but you're confounding a few things:\n- IP network protocol (TCP, UDP)\n- Transport protocol (HTTP, ZMQ)\n- Request protocol (JSON)\n\nIMO, JSON over HTTP would be what to use here, it's entrenched and works pretty well. I don't like using ZMQ for anything but notifications. \n\nCurrent RPC overhead is virtually all caused by application-level issues (such as all-encompassing locking), not the protocol. Switching to a different protocol (at any level) would not change that. Performance also _should_ have improved now that we no longer use boost::spirit_json. libevent http server should be very fast too.\n\nFor blocks, because of the amount of data, I agree that the JSON encoding overhead matters. We could think about some alternative path for requesting those from core (e.g. keeping a REST-like stub). Apart from that there is, AFAIK, nothing that returns a lot of data.\n",
