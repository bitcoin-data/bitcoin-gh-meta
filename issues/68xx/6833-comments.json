As the VPS is live for other processes cannot do a reboot all the time. First time it started from ~2 GB given as free. Or is there a command to make any unused memory available again without a reboot? Doubt that it makes any difference. 1 or 2 GB, bitcoind will eat it all. Setting the min. tx relay fee to 5.0 E-5 has not stopped this memory hunger. With the 1 GB taken by bitcoind in the graphs above there is nothing left for other programmes. \nWhat I find strange is that when I run 'top' and sort for memory use %MEM that, apart from the thirty-some percent taken by bitcoind, no other processes claim the rest. A few 0.1 and 0,2 % for things like httpd but nothing that amounts up to the other 70%. \n",
