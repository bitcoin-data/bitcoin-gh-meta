I ran a short (4 hour) test with valgrind --tool=massif, and CCoinsViewCache came up as using a lot of memory. A much longer test run is needed for this apparent memory leak issue to show up clearly. I'm about 24 hours into what I plan to be a 40- or 50-hour massif test. I'll post those results when I have them. It might take even longer than 50 hours for massif to get good results. it's taking 30 seconds for valgrind bitcoind to get through a getblocktemplate call, rather than the usual <= 1 sec. I don't know if the leak is related simply to the number of times GBT is called, or if it depends on the uniqueness of the mempool each time GBT is called.\n\n@older-c-coder I have not tested with Qt. A unit test would likely be difficult to write, since the issue is only apparent in terms of RSS usage after calling GBT frequently for around 24 hours. It's possible that this process might be accelerated (e.g. create a fake mempool from block X, run GBT/CNB, X++;, etc). Even then, such a test is likely to take a while, and we don't yet know if that approach will work at triggering the leak. \n",

The increased memory usage is mostly a result of the not actually limited size of CCoinsViewCache discussed in #6872 combined with poor memory allocator behavior.  \nThe problem is triggered by calling getblocktemplate which calls `CreateNewBlock`.  In `CreateNewBlock` every single tx in your memory pool is pulled into the in memory cache of both pcoins tip and a cache `view` on top of that.  The memory allocator also causes this memory to be allocated in a different location for every thread that calls getblocktemplate.  Although this memory is freed at the end of `CreateNewBlock`, there seems to be enough fragmentation that there is still some memory being used towards the end of the heap and the bulk of the memory can not be returned to the OS.  This can cause up to # of RPC threads (default: 4) times the memory allocation needed for 1 full memory pool worth of chainstate to remain resident.  In addition, depending on the size of your dbcache, if one of the calls to getblocktemplate causes a rehash of the unordered map in your pcoinsTip cache, then that can also take up space in another memory arena because now it has been allocated from a different thread.\n\nI'm working on a short term smaller rewrite of `CreateNewBlock` which will not require pulling the entire memory pool worth of txs into the cache, which should make the problem much better.\n",

One reason is that you are running into the multi-arena allocating/fragmentation bug described here in this issue, #6876. The other is that your mempool is getting bloated from the flood of 14780 byte transactions we're seeing right now.\n\nTry sticking `minrelaytxfee=0.0002` into your `~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` file, or running with the `minrelaytxfee=0.0001` command line option. That should reduce your mempool size by about 161 megs.\n",

As far as I understand it from IRC, he was getting a lot of the 14790 txns into his mempool via limitfreerelay=default, like these two (from his getrawmempool RPC):\n\nhttps://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/tx/951761082b38167ca92a94cce9f0783157434ffc66ff39715b1ac30a72cd6611\n\nhttps://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/tx/5935e25d931734e42e0fff881df79ea9e0d3f4c9d552e9ac20f8825b29049f0a\n\nThese two transactions were never getting evicted from his mempool, and were not getting incorporated into blocks by other miners. These were 2 of the 4 transactions that I checked, indicating that very roughly 50% of his mempool was filled with spam. Much more of them were in his mempool than could fit in his 5% priority block space, so his GBT block sizes were kept small even though his mempool was bloated. He was complaining of mempool size, not of RSS usage. I do not think he was encountering any bugs, just features that he did not understand and that may have not been designed optimally in terms of UX.\n",
