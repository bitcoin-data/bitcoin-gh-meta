   "body" : "Adding sendrawtransaction to the REST API enables web-clients like https://coinb.in/ (and many others) to work with Bitcoin Core nodes instead of using a centralized wallet API service.\n\nSo far the REST API was read-only but I don't know if this was intentionally or not.\n\nPython tests will follow ones it's clear when there are some Concept ACK for this PR.\n\nOr if someone likes to write some Python code for this PR let me know. I don't have much Python experience yet so it might take a while :)\n\nThanks Jonas Schnelli for the pre-PR feedback.\n",
