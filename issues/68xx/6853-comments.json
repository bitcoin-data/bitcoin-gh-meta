As mentioned in #6162, there is currently no test coverage which exercises the retarget code and is why commit df9eb5e, which introduced the retargetting bug, ended up making it to master.  In my opinion, providing a flag to work around a bug that was introduced instead of fixing the bug is a mistake.\n\nWhat is the point of having a regression test network if you aren't really testing the behavior of the code executed on mainnet due to adding special case branches?  With this commit, it will be possible to introduce a subtle consensus breaking change to mainnet for retargets that the tests will not be able to detect.\n",

But regtest is not the only means through which the consensus rules are tested or exercised, and it's certainly easier to use it to test many other things this way. The alternative you suggest is changing the code that the network is already running on just to be able to test it, which IMHO unnecessarily throws away the trust in that code\n",

This is what drove the original issue to begin with since Bitcoin Core simply no longer handles retargets properly on regtest.  We currently use simnet in btcd for this since it works properly across retargets, however we also wanted to be be able to test it against Bitcoin Core.\n\nSo, as you can see, this creates a situation where 3rd-party software can't properly be tested across retarget intervals on the regression test network with Bitcoin Core.  Also, with this PR, this would now be a regtest option that when set to default disables all retargeting so it doesn't match mainnet, and when enabled causes a broken retarget because the overflow is still not fixed.\n",
