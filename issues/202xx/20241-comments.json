It seems like a much smaller problem if a few wallet operations are temporarily unavailable while a big wallet is being loaded, as long as other GUI & RPC operations for other wallets and the node are available and everything is responsive.\r\n\r\nMaking the wallet/gui interface paginated seems useful if wallet code accessed transactions through database lookups, but much less useful if everything is in memory anyway",
