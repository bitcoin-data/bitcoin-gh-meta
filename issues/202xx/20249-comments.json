Now `CheckTxScriptsSanity` is run for the witness decode instead, but that fails (as intended) so it successfully decodes via the non-witness path.\r\n\r\nI think an example of a tx that previously failed to parse but now succeeds is `020000000003013f79606f8bbc4400ae1b370559e83236025a1abf5ff7d05e17aef32e00d7500e0100000000ffffffff0100e1f505000000001600147deebbf45206af95e6e3fa8423de14bf8db71b5200ffffffff`\r\n\r\nFix should be to add an additional rpc argument `, true)`.",
