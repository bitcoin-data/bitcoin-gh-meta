   "body" : "CAddrMan has internal consistency checks. Currently, these are only run when the program is compiled with the  `DEBUG_ADDRMAN` option. This option is not enabled on any of our CI builds, and it's likely that no-one is running them at all.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes consistency checks a (hidden) runtime option that can be enabled with `-checkaddrman`, where `-checkaddrman=n` will result in the consistency checks running every n operations (similar to `-checkmempool=n`). We set the ratio to 1/100 for our unit tests, and leave it disabled by default for all networks. Additionally, a consistency check failure now asserts, rather than logging and continuing. This matches the behavior of CTxMemPool and TxRequestTracker, where a failed consistency check asserts.",
