   "body" : "Considering the limited applicability of `reqSigs` and the confusing output of `1` in all cases except bare multisig, the `addresses` and `reqSigs` outputs are removed for all rpc commands.\r\n    \r\n1) add a new sane \"address\" field (for outputs that have an identifiable address, which doesn't include bare multisig)\r\n2) with -deprecatedrpc: leave \"reqSigs\" and \"addresses\" intact (with all weird/wrong behavior they have now)\r\n3) without -deprecatedrpc: drop \"reqSigs\" and \"addresses\" entirely always.\r\n    \r\nNote: Some light refactoring done to allow us to very easily delete a few chunks of code (marked with TODOs) when we remove this deprecated behavior.\r\n\r\nUsing `IsDeprecatedRPCEnabled` in core_write.cpp caused some circular dependencies involving core_io\r\n\r\nCircular dependencies were caused by rpc/util unnecessarily importing node/coinstats and node/transaction. Really what rpc/util needs are some fundamental type/helper-function definitions. So this was cleaned up to make more sense.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #20102.",
