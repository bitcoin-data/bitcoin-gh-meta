Create new wallet (testnet)\r\n2. Create new address with label: `testlabel1`\r\n3. Send 0.005 tBTC : https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/6b9d739034c32d6480ca8ccac567d05226d948e85c8adddb06340c5ff3c32526\r\n4. Check the transaction using `listtransactions`\r\n5. Backup wallet\r\n6. Exit bitcoin core and delete wallet folder from `testnet3/wallets`\r\n4. Copy the backup file in wallets folder: `backuptest2.dat`\r\n5.

At the same time, the backup does not contain the last few addresses and transactions.\r\nAfter restoring the backup, I expect to see all transactions for the entire period from the moment the wallet was created to the current moment. I really see that the last addresses and transactions have been restored, I can use the funds received.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a problem. I do not see in the output of listtransaction some transactions that were made after the backup was created. There are no transactions in the output that I make within my wallet (transferring funds from address to address).\r\n\r\nExperimentally, I found out, when restoring from a backup, automatically generated addresses are created without a label.
