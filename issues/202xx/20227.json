   "body" : "After reading [this post](https://unixsheikh.com/articles/important-open-source-projects-should-not-use-github.html) with the title Â«Important Open Source projects should not use GitHubÂ» I thought instantly about Bitcoin and it's source code. It is the most important open source project and it is hosted on GitHub.\r\n\r\nWas this topic ever discussed? I would think so after Microsoft aquired GitHub, but I couldn't find it. What happens if GitHub requires a Microsoft account to login to GitHub, are all developers willing to create a Microsoft account?\r\n\r\nI know, I don't offer a solution at this point. I heard about [Sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/) as an Alternative to GitHub. The problem is, the source code of Bitcoin will (with the current available git hosting providers) always be centralized. Is that the reason why Bitcoin didn't move away from GitHub?\r\n\r\nThis is more like a discussion, if this is the wrong place for that or there is already an open issue. Please close this one and point me in the right direction. Thanks!\r\n",
