We use it as a pure workflow and communication tools which can exchanged relatively painfree.\r\n\r\nSwitching away from GitHub just because of eventual expected friction makes little sense to me (as of today).\r\nAFAIK we'r still mirroring everything,... including the GitHub communication (comments, pulls, etc.). I also regularly fetch all pulls/issues html (which is nowadays incomplete with the lazy loading approach of comments and reviews).\r\n\r\nMaybe we should reinvestigate in mirroring \"everything\". Weekly fetching of all issues/pulls including all comments, etc. by the JSON API.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are viable GitHub alternatives (like GitLab) which probably makes it harder for Microsoft to add things like \"everyone needs a Microsoft account\".

I think actually the easiest thing to set up would be to a) create a webform that lets you upload an ssh pubkey which then creates a user which is restricted to git-shell, b) restirct each user via GIT_NAMESPACE to a subtree of refs which is prefixed by their ssh pubkey hash or so, c) use gitweb to display all the pushes people have, d) limit upload pack size and do something to limit how many pushes/hour each remote IP can do. I think the above basically lets you do an anonymous git project management with an hour or two of setup and without all the complication of something like gitlab or gitea where users have ot actually create accounts with emails and passwords and stuff.\r\n\r\n> iirc actually restricting users to git-shell with ssh isn't as trivial as it should be\r\n\r\nno, you just set their login shell, its one command or you can just edit /etc/passwd's shell entry and done. you also have to create an empty git-shell-commands file or something stupid but thats easy.\r\n\r\n> github i think is using a custom ssh daemon\r\n\r\nah, i could see that. i mean ssh is shit, but i dont think git-shell is the biggest of your worries in that case. and if you're worried just do a separate git-upload server and then pull from it every minute on the actual git server. but I think you have the same issue with gitlab or whatever. the other thing I was thinking about is doing git pushes via https, and then just setting a cookie for user auth. still anonymous, but users have to configure a per-repo cookieFile and set the flag to let the server set cookies locally. would be a tiny bit more work for users, but the server-side setup would be similar effort. just via nginx authentication modules instead of ssh. if you're feeling un-lazy, you can set it up for git.bitcoin.ninja and then I'll just let people use that server for stuff :)\r\n\r\n",

(That might change in the future of course.)\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a sysadmin task that I think is somewhat urgently needed by the project: we need a Bitcoin Core installation of ClusterFuzz/CIFuzz to catch issues such as the recent wtxid crash bug before merge (or at least soon after merge).

Thus I suggested an alternative project where these sysadmin resources could make a meaningful difference for end user security _right now_. That's all :)",
