This will remove from the `OutputGroup` any dust outputs. But if after the removal, the `OutputGroup`'s effective value is still positive, then it remains available for coin selection. So it is possible that BnB will select an `OutputGroup` but not the dust outputs associated with the same destination, so the avoid partial spends condition is violated.\r\n\r\nThis does have a privacy risk as the user may think that avoid partial spends is active, but then a partial spend occurs. If this risk is indeed a problem, then we could just remove any `OutputGroup` that contains dust outputs, regardless of the other outputs in that group. However this has a DoS attack risk. If an attacker sends dust outputs to existing addresses, then it is possible for that attacker to prevent someone who has enabled avoid partial spends from spending any of their coins because all `OutputGroup`s would be removed for containing dust.",

By retaining the dust filter we potentially open ourselves to future partial spending.\r\n\r\nOne thing I don't quite understand, will a dusty output not always be a dusty output, so long as the user doesn't modify `-dustrelayfee`? If so, then I don't think this is an issue -- that output will not be selected for an output group today, nor in the future. If however a user changes their `-dustrelayfee` then they can be notified of the interaction, perhaps via `ParameterInteraction()`?\r\n\r\nFor me it would be cleaner if the `-avoidpartialspends` flag worked as advertised and _always_ prevented partial spends. In the event that the DoS attack mentioned occured, ideally the wallet would return an error message that there is enough output value to construct the transaction but the outputs are being excluded by the `-avoidpartialspends` flag, and the user must disable it so that they can be selected.",

      "body" : "I agree, that we still have this issue with potentially making a partial spend, when we have an uneconomical UTXO thatâs part of a group. I think there may be a confusion here between dust and uneconomical UTXOs, though: in Bitcoin Core, dust pertains to an output whose value is less than `dustrelayfee Ã (input_weight + output_weight)` (where dustrelayfee is a feerate) with the default `dustrelayfee` being 3â¯á¹©/vB. So, dust outputs will always be dust (unless the dustrelayfee is changed). We only use the dust criteria to prevent our own creation of such outputs and not relay of transactions that create dust outputs.\r\nAn uneconomical UTXO is one whose input cost is higher than its own value. Whether a UTXO is uneconomical depends on the target feerate of the transaction weâre building. So, even something that we might classify as dust could still be economical to spend at the `minRelayTxFee` or slightly higher feerates.\r\n\r\nI agree that it would be better if `-avoidpartialspends` always prevented partial spends, but only when we have a decent UX around being able to side-step the spending block. Otherwise, I would worry about it being easy to inconvenience Bitcoin users with forced-address-reuse attacks.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am pondering whether we should permit spending of uneconomical UTXOs when the user is creating a transaction with `minRelayTxFee`. That would be the cheapest time to clean up the UTXO set. Currently, Knapsack always permits it, which will cause the users to aggressively clean out uneconomical UTXOs even at higher feerates.\r\n\r\n(It is by the way my opinion that Knapsack is detrimental and should be removed.)",
