   "body" : "Wallet directories were introduced because BDB has issues with shared database environments. Since SQLite does not have database environments it is not necessary to have these directories. So instead, we go back to the original multiwallet plan of having just wallet files named with the desired wallet name. Note that this configuration is technically supported with BDB wallets although new wallets would not be created like this. For SQLite, this is both supported and the way that wallets are created.\r\n\r\nDepends on #18788 for tests.",
