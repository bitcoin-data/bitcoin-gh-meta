The revision, which we had been using as the minor version, is now the minor version. The revision number is dropped. The build number is promoted to being part of the version number. This also avoids issues where it was accidentally not included in the version number.\r\n\r\nThe CLIENT_VERSION remains the same format as previous as previously, as the Major version was 0 so it never actually got included in it.\r\n\r\nThe user agent string formatter is updated to follow this new versioning.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nHonestly I'm just tired of all of the people asking for \"1.0\" that maybe this'll shut them up. Skip the whole 1.0 thing and go straight to version 22.0!\r\n\r\nAlso, this means that the terminology we commonly use lines up with how the variables are named. So major versions are actually bumping the major version number, etc.",
