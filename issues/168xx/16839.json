   "body" : "This change is mainly a naming / organization change intended to simplify #10102. It:\r\n\r\n- Renames struct InitInterfaces to struct NodeContext and moves it from\r\n  src/init.h to src/node/context.h. This is a cosmetic change intended to make\r\n  the point of the struct more obvious.\r\n\r\n- Gets rid of BanMan and ConnMan globals making them NodeContext members\r\n  instead. Getting rid of these globals has been talked about in past as a way\r\n  to implement testing and simulations. Making them NodeContext members is a\r\n  way of keeping them accessible without the globals.\r\n\r\n- Splits g_rpc_interfaces global into g_rpc_node and g_rpc_chain globals. This\r\n  better separates node and wallet rpc methods. Node RPC methods should have\r\n  access NodeContext, while wallet RPC methods should only have indirect access\r\n  to node functionality via interfaces::Chain.\r\n\r\n- Adds NodeContext& references to interfaces::Chain class and the\r\n  interfaces::MakeChain() function. This is needed to access ConnMan and BanMan\r\n  instances without the globals.\r\n\r\n- Gets rid of redundant Node and Chain instances in Qt tests. This is\r\n  needed due to the previous MakeChain change, and also makes test setup a\r\n  little more straightforward. More cleanup could be done in the future, but it\r\n  will require deduplication of bitcoind, bitcoin-qt, and TestingSetup init\r\n  code.",
