   "body" : "This feature allows for the pruning of blocks from the disk, when their blockHeight is > to the current Tip height. \r\n\r\nWhy is this needed?\r\nWell let's say you want to create a backup of the blocks & chainstate at a specific block height, you can easily do this by running `invalidateblock` and making a copy of the `blocks/` and `chainstate` folders. \r\nThe issue with creating a backup this way is that when installing a node based on it, you would run into this issue. #16353 \r\nThis feature solves this by simply removing most of the blocks that are invalidated from the disk. \r\n\r\nIf this feature gets Concept ACK, I will build the tests needed and update the PR.",
