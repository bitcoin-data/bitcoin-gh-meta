However, instead of just a single connection between each pair of nodes, we end up with up to four connections for a \"middle\" node (two outbound, two inbound, from each side).\r\n\r\nThis is generally redundant (tx and block relay should succeed with just a single connection) and confusing. For example, test timeouts after a call to `sync_` may be racy and hard to reproduce. On top of that, the test `debug.log`s are hard to read because txs and block invs may be relayed on the same connection multiple times.\r\n\r\nFix this by inlining `connect_nodes_bi` in the two tests that need it, and then replace it with a single `connect_nodes` in all other tests.\r\n\r\nHistoric background:\r\n\r\n`connect_nodes_bi` has been introduced as a (temporary?) workaround for bug #5113 and #5138, which has long been fixed in #5157 and #5662.",
