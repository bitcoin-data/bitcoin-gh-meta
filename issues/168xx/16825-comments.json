I agree its only a somewhat marginal benefit, but I wouldn't discount it completely (assuming my understanding of the likelyhood of finding Tor peers by default is correct, which may not be....).\r\n\r\nc) I agree Tor listening sockets may be limited, hopefully the bump to 150 helps. Anecdotally, my Tor-listening nodes don't appear to get any more connections over Tor than normal IP, in fact much, much less.",

A few ideas going forward here include: (a) using the blocks-over-REST/HTTP module in Rust to fetch over Tor, (b) same with headers-over-DNS, (c) quickly rotating through a huge set of known Tor hidden services to find any peers that have some blocks which you do not as more of a fallback mechanism in case of successful Eclipse attack(s).",
