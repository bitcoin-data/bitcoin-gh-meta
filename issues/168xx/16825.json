This is a\r\nnaive fix for the issue where we fail to attempt any outbound Tor\r\nconnections when our regular network is being censored, but should\r\nalso stand on its own.\r\n\r\nAlso bumps max connections to 150 which I don't think should be controversial, but may be important due to the relative fewer number of onion-listening nodes.",
