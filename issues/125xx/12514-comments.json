      "body" : "**Confirmed Working**\r\nI am not sure whether it was the update made in relation to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11560 or the changes that I made, or both... But I have solved my problem! Summary of changes for those experiencing the same issue is below.\r\n\r\n**Proof I am now nearly done downloading the blockchain:**\r\n![btc_working](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16307383/36623707-e012a1d0-18d4-11e8-9e16-e32dd0b22fd9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI had to stop the client **and wait for the window to close** many times because the peers either disappeared or stopped sending data. Wait for window to close. If you have no choice and have to close it or you crash and it fails to start, run with the reindex-chainstate and let it run. Then run it without reindex option.\r\n\r\n\r\n**STEPS TO FIX IF YOU EXPERIENCE SAME ISSUE:**\r\n\r\n1) Move your /home/user/.bitcoin folder to your best/fastest hard drive.\r\n    -- SSD (Solid State) is obviously best choice\r\n    -- HSSD (Hybrid Solid State) is second choice\r\n    -- HDD (Regular HDD - IDE/SATA - NON SSD) is LAST choice\r\n\r\n2) Open Bitcoin-QT with the following command:\r\n    -- **sudo nice -n -20 sudo -u MYUSERNAME bitcoin-qt -data-dir=/path/to/my/hssd/.bitcoin/ &**\r\n\r\n3) Wait for download - monitor peer count / network transfer in the debug window (help -> debug)\r\n\r\n4) If the peer count drops to 0 and/or the network transfer drops, close Bitcoin but WAIT for the window to disappear - I waited 6 hours for it to disappear. It is basically saving it's state, and if you quit it looses track of where it was. \r\n\r\n\r\n**IF YOU CRASHED OR CLOSED THE WINDOW that says not to close it, you can reindex the data on disk by performing the following:**\r\n\r\n1) Run Bitcoin with reindex:\r\n    -- **sudo nice -n -20 sudo -u MYUSERNAME bitcoin-qt -data-dir=/path/to/my/hssd/.bitcoin/ -reindex-chainstate &**\r\n\r\n2) Once completed, it may resume downloading Blockchain, OR it may stop all-together (0 peers, 0 data)\r\n\r\n3) If it completes and does NOT resume downloading, close Bitcoin-QT again, WAIT AGAIN for window to close\r\n\r\n4) Run Bitcoin without reindex:\r\n    -- **sudo nice -n -20 sudo -u MYUSERNAME bitcoin-qt -data-dir=/path/to/my/hssd/.bitcoin/ &**\r\n\r\nI hope anyone else with this issue has the same success as me, and that this information is helpful. Message me or post here if you need help with this issue.\r\n\r\n**Ticket left open as GUI bug not resolved:**\r\n-- Debug window does not record network data while closed\r\n-- Network graph looses data when the slider to change scope of graph is adjusted\r\n-- Closing debug window looses network graph\r\n-- During reindex, the progress bar does not show anything/shows wrong value\r\n\r\n**After several days of hard work I have a 100% sync'd node :D**\r\n\r\n**Thanks to MyS5Droid for the help, and the developers for their hard work in this project!**",
