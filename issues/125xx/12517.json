It will not fall back to seed nodes, because its address manager is non-empty, but it will not sync either, because its peers are all DNS seeder only.\r\n\r\nFix: count DNS seeder peers as `seeders` and require `addrman.size() > seeders` instead of `== 0`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/aae64a21ba25ca86fe2bbb581681dc20d613fb44/src/net.cpp#L1768",
