   "body" : "Here is the entire process on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\r\n\r\nUsually, on all of my previous attempts, the first make has failed. This time I *did* enable update during install which I have not done previously. Why this should make any difference when we run `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade` is a mystery and I do not think it changed anything.\r\n\r\nNote that usually `make HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32` fails early.\r\n\r\nI followed all steps in `/doc/build-windows.md`, but contancenate the apt install commands.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that `sudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu zesty universe\"` does what is expected on its own and this *may be* the source of an issue since the whole purpose of enabling this repo is to get the zesty version of `Mingw-w64` due to a bug. The following `sudo apt update` command responds with errors about the repo not having a release file and, separately `sudo apt upgrade` is not always successful. I have observed elsewhere that repo mirrors are not always in perfect sync and suspect the same here.\r\n\r\nThen, `sudo update-alternatives --config x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++` usually fails with a 'no alternatives' response *but not this time*, so I selected POSIX as instructed. I did previously run `sudo apt update` several times after `sudo apt upgrade` failed before running it again. I suspect this failure is why the first make command fails and probably means previous steps need to be revisited.\r\n\r\n**There seems to possibly be some intermittent repo issues.**\r\n\r\nAlso note, this time I checked out the v0.16.0rc4 tag into a new branch rather than just building on top of master. I do not know what else this changed. **Apparently there have been some more recent dependancy change that were breaking make.** See Issue #12515\r\n\r\nThe first obvious issue during the process is that the previous `update-alternatives ...` command usually fails, and preceding that, the issue with `sudo apt update`.\r\n\r\n![Step 1](http://storage6.static.itmages.com/i/18/0225/h_1519531420_1325696_933cfa5db5.png)\r\n\r\n![Step 2](http://storage3.static.itmages.com/i/18/0225/h_1519532370_8919339_61193f96a3.png)\r\n\r\n![Step 3](http://storage4.static.itmages.com/i/18/0225/h_1519532476_2042879_6bfd1e9471.png)\r\n\r\n![Step 4](http://storage7.static.itmages.com/i/18/0225/h_1519533001_4634839_0203789ec0.png)\r\n\r\n![Step 5](http://storage8.static.itmages.com/i/18/0225/h_1519533079_6992405_210efb3217.png)\r\n\r\n![Step 6](http://storage9.static.itmages.com/i/18/0225/h_1519533200_6056267_47293a39ee.png)\r\n\r\n![Step 7](http://storage2.static.itmages.com/i/18/0225/h_1519533291_5676674_156186835e.png)\r\n\r\n![Step 8](http://storage3.static.itmages.com/i/18/0225/h_1519533394_8611620_b82ae93bed.png)\r\n\r\n![Step 9](http://storage4.static.itmages.com/i/18/0225/h_1519533504_7160306_7ac49fe84b.png)\r\n\r\n![Step 10](http://storage6.static.itmages.com/i/18/0225/h_1519533641_6998675_7484b7fc25.png)\r\n\r\n![Step 11](http://storage9.static.itmages.com/i/18/0225/h_1519534022_7374736_8c7c38567b.png)\r\n\r\n![Step 12](http://storage2.static.itmages.com/i/18/0225/h_1519534118_4103275_6e3142b1c3.png)\r\n\r\n![Step 13](http://storage3.static.itmages.com/i/18/0225/h_1519534204_7053588_000af6e88b.png)\r\n\r\n    >sudo apt install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config bsdmainutils curl git g++-mingw-w64-x86-64 software-properties-common\r\n    >sudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu zesty universe\"\r\n    >sudo apt update #this posts errors in response\r\n    >sudo apt upgrade #this failed\r\n    >sudo apt update #this posts errors in response\r\n    >sudo apt update #this posts errors in response\r\n    >sudo apt upgrade #succeeded this time\r\n    >sudo update-alternatives --config x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ #this usually fails with no alternate\r\n    >cd /usr/src\r\n    >sudo git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git\r\n    >sudo chmod -R a+rw bitcoin\r\n    >git checkout v0.16.0rc4 -b v16rc4\r\n    >PATH=$(echo \"$PATH\" | sed -e 's/:\\ mnt.*//g')\r\n    >cd depends\r\n    >make HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32 #this usually fails early\r\n\r\n![Step 14](http://storage2.static.itmages.com/i/18/0225/h_1519539081_7759945_876e4c818b.png)\r\n\r\n    >cd ..\r\n    >./autogen.sh\r\n\r\n![Step 15](http://storage6.static.itmages.com/i/18/0225/h_1519541295_2683851_c33fff5d94.png)\r\n\r\n    >CONFIG_SITE=$PWD/depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32/share/config.site ./configure --prefix=/\r\n\r\n![Step 16](http://storage9.static.itmages.com/i/18/0225/h_1519541671_6447794_4e3e8c1dc6.png)\r\n\r\n    >make\r\n\r\nThe compiled executable using this procedure operated correctly on Windows 10 64-bit with limited testing.
