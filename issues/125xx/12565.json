I'll rebase when that's merged.\r\n\r\nIf a user sends funds to a single destination, they might be trying to move all their funds to another wallet or an exchange. However it's also possible that they are making a payment and coin selection found a matching input.\r\n\r\nWith the former it's fine to reduce the output in order to increase the fee, but with the latter it's not, e.g. it could lead to underpaying an invoice. In that case we show the following warning:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"655\" alt=\"schermafbeelding 2018-02-28 om 13 38 14\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/36788181-39b26476-1c8d-11e8-81d9-91960c5d2619.png\">\r\n\r\nAt the risk of too much UI clutter, the message could be made stronger by showing the original amount(s) vs. the new amount(s).\r\n\r\nFor comparison, this message is shown when a change output can be reduced:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"354\" alt=\"schermafbeelding 2018-02-28 om 13 50 20\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/36788687-28bbff04-1c8f-11e8-99bc-31ed9b32af54.png\">\r\n\r\nIf in the future we're able to add inputs, we should probably offer the user a choice if they prefer to reduce an output instead. It's worth keeping that in mind when choosing the right wording here.",
