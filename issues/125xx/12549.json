   "body" : "This branch optimizes various `prevector` operations, especially resizing vectors. While profiling the `loadblk` thread I noticed that a lot of time was being spent in `prevector::resize()` which led to this work. I have some data here indicating that it takes up **37%** of the time in `ReadBlockFromDisk()`: https://monad.io/readblockfromdisk.svg\r\n\r\nThis branch improves things significantly. For trivial types, the new results for the prevector benchmark are:\r\n\r\n * `PrevectorClearTrivial` which tests `prevector::clear()` becomes 24.6x faster\r\n * `PrevectorDestructorTrivial` which tests `prevector::~prevector()` becomes 20.5x faster\r\n * `PrevectorResizeTrivial` which tests `prevector::resize()` becomes 20.3x faster\r\n\r\nNote that in practice it looks like the prevector is only used to contain `unsigned char` types, which is a trivial type. The benchmarks are testing a bit of an extreme case, but the changes here are motivated by the profiling data for `ReadBlockFromDisk()` I linked to above.\r\n\r\nThe pull request here consists of a series of three commits:\r\n * The first adds new benchmarks but does not change the prevector code.\r\n * The second is from @AkioNak , and merges some prevector optimizations he submitted in #11988 \r\n * The third optimizes `prevector::resize()` to use `memset()` when the prevector contains trivially constructible types",
