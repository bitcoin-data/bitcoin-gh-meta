So that\nvendor will be able to pay the transaction fee.\nIf the vendor does not willing to pay the transaction fee (no agreement\nmade between the vendor and the customer about this) then the customer can\nmake a regular transaction to pay for the good. If customer decides that\nhe/she put a low fee on the transaction so that the transaction will take a\nlong time to occur then he/she should bumpfee without reducing the output.\n\nSo bumpfee reduction from the output should be optional and should be\nasked. For the above showcase, it may also be a good idea that if a bumpfee\nmade by reducing the output, the receiving side of the transaction (vendor\nin the above case) should also be asked if he/she agrees with the\nreduction. If he/she does not agree then the bumpfee should not occur.\n\nOn Wed, Feb 28, 2018 at 8:18 PM, Luke Dashjr <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Indeed, to rephrase: users should be able to reduce outputs; it just\n> should require explicitly asking to do so, and shouldn't be the\n> default/recommended behaviour.\n>\n> Ã¢ÂÂ\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12565#issuecomment-369309361>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAuuLwNRNM-bPtKZ1uaMYcWwIvEps_4Pks5tZYfNgaJpZM4SWmpP>\n> .\n>\n",

Perhaps it's better to hold back this PR until `feebumper::CreateTransaction` supports adding inputs. By default the `OK` button would just add an input. We could show each of the destination addresses with a check box \"reduce amount\". That would seem like a safer UX.\r\n\r\nUnless that change takes forever. Maybe we can tag this with 0.17, and revisit the discussion if this better alternative isn't ready?\r\n\r\n@bedri there's no way (that I know) for the wallet to communicate with the merchant. The only thing we can do is inform the user that they should do this.\r\n",
