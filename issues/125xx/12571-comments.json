      "body" : "Some transactions are clearing at 1 sat/byte, but after how long, and what fraction of 1 sat/byte transactions are removed from the mempool instead of ever clearing?  There is no way for a user to know if its going to be dropped  or eventually confirmed, or see if it is in any way advancing in priority in the mempool. If it does get dropped, recovering with a double spend is a complicated process, beyond the capabilities of most users. It's fine if advanced users want to subject themselves to this delay and risk by manually configuring a lower fee, but should this really be the default? I would suggest to default to spending a few extra cents to avoid any chance of having 0.5BTC stuck in limbo. Even if only 1% of users are experiencing these unconfirmed transactions as a result of this low default, it is still very bad for mass adoption, because it is a potentially souring experience. A user who loses $5000 USD due to an unconfirmed transaction is never coming back, and will spread their horror story to others.\r\n",
