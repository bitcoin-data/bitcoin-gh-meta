The whole network does not usually relay transactions below 1 sat/byte and even if you can find some nodes to relay, the miners won't pick up the transaction. I did a test, set up a 0.000001 relay fee (10x lower than the default)  and my node picked up a few such transactions. Some even show up on block explorers https://btc.com/895d90280089701e00230089337dc8304fbf339d4f1eb8d4f63b606a5abe1b1c but miners do not include them in blocks. ",
