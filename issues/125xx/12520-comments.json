Just before I wanted to create the pull request, I merged the last changes from bitcoin/master branch and found out that my change did not compile anymore as the editaddressdialog.cpp don't support creating a new receiving address any more.\r\n\r\nI will try to change my way how I work, but for now I don't see a comfortable way to have an overview of my addresses and can create new ones in one single gui.\r\n\r\nIs there any chance to get this feature back?",
