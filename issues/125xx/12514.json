Also I suspect my 16-26 peers are not sending data, and suggest peer limit variable so it can be increased at will.\r\n\r\n**Possibly related to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11560**\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\nFast Initial Sync - constant data transfer (download) and enough peers so that there is always peers sending data\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n![btc_slo_net](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16307383/36573340-6bd75296-180e-11e8-9910-f7ac02111aef.png)\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\nDownload core client from GH and install it, open it.\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nAMD Phenom X1100T BLACK 6 core processor, 16 GB ram, 1 x 2TB HDD, 1 x 2TB HSSD (Hybrid SSD)\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n- LONG breaks in network transfer\r\n- Too few peers (IMO, which is why need peer variable)\r\n- Network window looses data every time the time slider is changed... It should adjust and show the current data in the new time frame. And make it track with the debug window closed.\r\n- Port is forwarded (and seen from outside - connections in and out)\r\n- **nice -n -20 bitcoin-qt** does not help\r\n- 6000 DBCache not help\r\n- Added bunch of nodes/seednodes/connects\r\n- **Still have to make sure the userdir is on the HSSD (I confuse the drive manufacturers sometimes)**\r\n\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n\r\n**Config:**\r\nserver=1\r\ndaemon=1\r\n\r\n**Debug.log - unable to fit under maximum for every pastebin website in sight :-/**\r\n\r\nThanks for your help :)",
