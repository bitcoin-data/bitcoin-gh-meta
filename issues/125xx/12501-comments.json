If the fee is `x` per 1000 bytes, and the tx is `y` bytes, then the fee is `x*y/1000`. That seems pretty intuitive to me. If a tx that was 1001 bytes cost `2x`, then that would be described as \"`x` per 1000 bytes or part thereof\", I should think. The fees work the same way as buying cheese or gasoline. If the cheese costs $x per pound, and you're buying 1.1 pounds of it, you pay $1.1x, not $2x.",

      "body" : "@dooglus It seems that perhaps you've discovered a bug.  Although this clearly is not a detrimental bug given that the resulting transaction fee is lower than what you expected it to be (which I suspect is unlikely to yield negative complaints), it still should probably be addressed at the very least.\r\n\r\nUpdating the tooltip may _not_ the ideal way of going about remedying this discrepancy though, and so perhaps raising a separate issue entitled \"transaction fee discrepancies\" that focuses on getting the underlying mechanics of this sorted out would be better?  (Feel free to reference this PR if you do raise this as a separate issue.)\r\n\r\nI'm favouring what @Empact suggested because I do think that specifying \"virtual size\" is likely to be confusing to at least some end users (particularly those who aren't technical).  If the tooltip were to reference documentation in a \"see also ... for more detailed information\" manner, I certainly think that would be a good option as it would not detract from keeping the tooltip text simple, straight-forward, and easy to understand, while also satisfying those who do want more technical detail.",

      "body" : "@dooglus Thanks again for raising this issue.  I just rebased all the commits after reviewing the \"virtual size\" wording in today's Bitcoin Core Developer meeting...\r\n\r\nThe consensus seems to be that we're going to \"bite the bullet\" so-to-speak and simply use the wording in the current commit which refers to the \"virtual size\" of transactions.  It was also noted that this is a term that people can search for on Google to find out more if they need/want to (we considered possibly using other ways to describe this, which we did not favour because that would be introducing newer terminology, which in turn would create confusion).",
