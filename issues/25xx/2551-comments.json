As mentioned in the OP one of those is the stack trace, as long as only the function addresses and not the rest of the stack contents is dumped. But the register values would be off limits as they can contain parts of (or derived of) private keys.\n\nMaybe that's enough... but maybe some other things would be useful as well:\n- Current configuration (except RPC key and maybe others)\n- Last RPC commands (ok, this gets scary, as there may be importprivkeys and such)\n- Last NN bytes of debug.log\n- Statistics about memory usage and leveldb\n- ...\n",

For example:\nAn address is generated for the exclusive use of gathering and sharing diagnostic data\nOnce the address is used for volunteering information, it can no longer be used for normal transactions\nThe address can only send/receive small amounts of bitcoin.\nThe address cannot accumulate more than xyz maximum amount of bitcoin\nThe volunteer mode sends/receives transactions only to other volunteer addresses continuously and at random.\n\nSome other possibilities:\nThe addresses are \"owned\" by the developer team and loaned out to the volunteer computers.  If the volunteer computer does not have any activity over the course of xyz days/months/etc. its address is returned to the developer team for reuse.\nTo minimize the potential for abuse, the volunteer program is limited and requires registration/approval from a moderator.\n\nI know this is not perfect, but maybe it's a starting point for a general idea that could be improved with feedback from others?\n",

      "body" : "@ag346 it seems that the big issue might be the participant's other actual private keys getting (all or partially) leaked in a crash report.  This might be over-complicating things, but brainstorming here: could there be a suggestion or even some utility for the tester-client to immediately generate new addresses and spend all of the potentially-compromised coins to them?  Could be optional but recommended upon the next startup. I don't know if this would necessitate sending the crashdump on some sort of delay until the wallet is secured again.  One glaring problem I see with this is transaction fees.  \n",
