I didn't realize this is what it looks like.\n\nThe way I was trying to use my client is by keeping all the money in the same address for which I have they key stored offline, but also have it in my bitcoin wallet so that I can actually use it. The offline version is more of a backup than a security system in this case.\n\nThis change system is really problematic because it means that I can't make sure that my money stays at one address if I use bitcoind.\n\n\"The wallet file contains the private keys for change addresses, and they can receive and send coins normally. However, the GUI in the default client does not display them in the address book.\"\n\nThis is the part that can lead to a lot of user error. I'm probably not alone in assuming that when I list my public keys I'm listing all public keys bitcoind knows about.\n\nIs there a better way to keep my money at the same address which is also stored offline? I don't think copying wallet files to USB sticks is very convenient.\n",

Is there any reason not to have a way to dump out all the private information about a given account (as opposed to address)? There is dumpprivkey, but that's deceptively convenient while not actually giving you enough info to import your account on another computer. How about dumpprivaccountdata or something? It would dump out info about not only one address, but all addressed for this account including all change addresses.\n\nTo me this is a problem:\n\n```\nuser@computer:./bitcoind help | grep change\nuser@computer:\n```\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a way to get any info about change addresses. The account to address mapping was the most confusing part of bitcoind and this hidden change account business makes it even more of a black box when I want to know everything that's happening in there.\n\nIs there a page of warnings for people who think they know how bitcoin works and want to use bitcoind? Maybe that would've saved me from being confused and scared. If not, I could start one...\n",
