I get the following error:\n\n```\n.../bitcoin/src/qt/paymentrequest.proto: -1: error: File does not reside within any path specified \nusing --proto_path (or -I).  You must specify a --proto_path which encompasses this file.  Note that \nthe proto_path must be an exact prefix of the .proto file names -- protoc is too dumb to figure out when\n two paths (e.g. absolute and relative) are equivalent (it's harder than you think).\n```\n\nOn first look this is weird because --proto_path is provided, and points to the src/qt directory. However, this fails because it is not an exact match. The command line becomes:\n\n```\nprotoc --cpp_out=build --proto_path=src/qt ../bitcoin/src/qt/paymentrequest.proto\n```\n\nSo, proto_path is relative to the current working directory (which is the output directory) whereas the proto file is in the source/input directory.\nI tried to do:\n\n```\nPROTO_PATH = $$PWD/src/qt\n```\n\nHowever, this doesn't solve the problem. It changes the command line to:\n\n```\nprotoc --cpp_out=build --proto_path=/store/orion/projects/bitcoin/bitcoin/src/qt ../bitcoin/src/qt/paymentrequest.proto\n```\n\nSo PWD is an absolute path; not the relative path as used for the source files. `protoc` is still too dumb to understand this.\n\nThe only way I could solve this is by changing the line in `protobuf.pri` to:\n\n```\nprotobuf_decl.commands = $${PROTOC} --cpp_out=\"$${PROTO_DIR}\" $${PROTOPATHS} --proto_path=${QMAKE_FILE_IN_PATH} ${QMAKE_FILE_NAME}\n```\n\nThis is pretty much a hack but heh...\n",

Tested by running over Tor and watching the IP addresses in the ssl_access.log on the server.\n\nRefund addresses are not shown in the GUI (unless you receive a refund, in which case they will be properly labelled). I added a backwards-compatible change to the wallet; \"purpose&lt;address&gt;\" entries are written to wallet.dat, with values of \"send\" \"receive\" \"refund\" or \"unknown\" (\"unknown\" the default, and all old address book entries will be \"unknown\"). This is backwards-compatible because old code just ignores keys it doesn't recognize in wallet.dat (old versions of Bitcoin will show refund addresses as \"receive\" addresses).\n\nOne last TODO: fix the pull-tester Windows/mingw Qt libraries so they're statically compiled with OpenSSL, so Windows binaries from the pull-tester machine will work properly.\n",

[JP]\" as with Chrome instead of mtgox.com).\n\nAn EV cert is identified by the contents of the \"Certificate Policies\" field in the X.509 cert. Each issuer sets the value to be different, unfortunately. The values are OIDs. I _think_ just checking against a hard coded list is sufficient - CAs should not sign certificates that contain other issuers OIDs.\n\nThere is a list of OIDs considered valid for marking EV certs here:\n\nhttps://certs.opera.com/03/ev-oids.xml\n\n(also, on Wikipedia).\n\nI believe just having an array in the source would be sufficient to verify this. When you see the magic marker, it's OK to use the O field instead of the CN field of the subject, giving a friendly name instead of a domain name.\n",

Then that manually intersected set will become the canonical root CA cert set.\n\nGavin can avoid all that pain and misery by just generating his own set of root CAs and shipping them.

This message should be improved.\n- PaymentACK messages need to be escaped.\n- Multiple addresses in a single payment request error - possibly related to #1850 \n\nI also skimmed over the code, and merged it with a bunch of other pullrequests (for next-test). Nothing stood out as obviously wrong or odd.\n",

I'm not sure of the right answer-- maybe the user just received some bitcoins and just has to wait a few minutes for them to confirm, so leaving the payment request is the right thing to do.

If you have high traffic, you'll have many users making bets for which they were still able to fetch the payment request. You have no way of paying them without knowing a refund address, and you have no way to contact them. Of course you can wait for them to contact you, but if that is necessary for every minute of downtime, you'll need very high reliability of your service (DoS attacks, anyone?), or poor customer support.\n\nIt is true that the locked funds issue right now makes this harder, as we cannot deal well with non-confirming transactions. I consider that a separate issue, but it makes an optimal implementation difficult now. But if you can't do that, please at least save the payment request, and retry getting PaymentACKs for some time, just like we retry broadcasting normal transactions.\n\nAnd put a suggestion in the BIP that this is recommended. Even if you can't implement it yourself now - in some environments it may be significantly easier to do.\n",

I suspect it will be easier to just lock the inputs for the estimated worst-case Payment-->PaymentACK round trip, and broadcast the transaction when the PaymentACK is received. If Payment->PaymentACK succeeds, then broadcast the transaction; if it fails, then just unlock the inputs and tell the user \"error communicating\".\n\nI've been putting off writing code to save the PaymentRequest/Payment/PaymentACK messages in the wallet, because adding more stuff to wallet.dat when we're likely to rewrite it soon for HD support might make the upgrade harder, and because I'm not planning on implementing any GUI for looking at old PaymentRequests.

If one of them fails, then we can't cancel the transaction-- the other merchant will go ahead and broadcast it for us.\n\nRebroadcasting the Payment message if the merchant's site goes down would be nice to have.  \"patches welcome\"\n",
