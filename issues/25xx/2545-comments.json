Because \"a keychain is an encrypted container\" ([link](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25230?locale=en_US)). \r\nIt is also possible to create multiple keychains(with a different password) for the same account. Therefore people sharing the same account can also stay safe. Also, the access to the keychain can be application restricted (only bitcoin core can access the keychain). \r\n\r\n(my answer/thoughts/ideas regarding your comments)\r\n1. **Backups. I suppose backup commands could fetch all keys from the keychain first**\r\nThere is possible to do a simple fetch command. Apple also has a nice tool for transferring the keychain from old to new computers ([link](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH20120?locale=en_US)). However, I think having a fetch command is good for cross-platform compatibility.\r\n\r\n2. **macOS might prompt user for keychain access at weird moments, as it needs to save more keys**\r\nThis might be a problem. I have been doing some test with the keychain API. I do get a prompt for inserting passwords at some weird times (some functions are weirder than others). However, if the keychain support gets backed well enough into the GUI this problem might fade away.\r\n\r\n3.  **Multiple wallet support (#11383 / #12610)**\r\nHaving a different service name for the keychain or creating a new keychain for each wallet can separate the multiple wallets.\r\n\r\n4. **Wallet encryption support (is the value that's stored in the key chain encrypted?)**\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n5. **How do we warn the user that they shouldn't delete their keychain and take those keys with them when moving to a new machine?**\r\nI'm no UX expert so this will be a bad answer. Since the keychain will be treated as a wallet.dat, the keychain implementation should get the same warnings as the wallet.dat implementation.\r\n\r\n",
