I've noticed that, but have not been able to think of a good\nsolution.\n\nAnd, you have picked up on one of the issues that bitcoin has: that it is\npossible to create transaction outputs that are uneconomical to spend. This\nis a problem, and one possible fix is to alter the fee system so it is\nbased on the size of outputs, not the size of the whole transaction.\n\nI also think that the fee, at current bitcoin values, is too high. But we\nstill don't know where the price will settle down at following last months\nmadness. Anywhere between $20 and $200 is possible! When a bit of sanity\nreturns to the market, the community of miners and users will work out what\nis a reasonable fee amount.\n\nAlso, there is a growing list of 'things that should be changed'.\nStructural things about the way bitcoin works. These are being actively\nconsidered, and there is a system that allows these sort of changes to be\nmake.\n\nSo, yes, we accept that your complaint is based on some things that should\nbe changed. Simple things first - the text in the message for setting the\nfee should make clear that this is the optional fee only - there are\nmandatory fees calculated around the technical, internal details about the\ntransaction - namely, the size, in bytes (which is related to the value of\nall the transactions that make up the input), the number and value of the\noutputs. These points are difficult to express in less than 100 words! We\nneed some way to demonstrate that, other than letting the user enter the\ntransaction, and say \"No , you can't\" when they click 'send'. but I can\noffer no suggestions how.\n\nOn 24 April 2013 11:48, Timwi notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Besides, we lost track of what this bugreport was about.

      "body" : "I think it's a bit unfair to attack someone who simply made a wrong assumption about the system.\n\n@Timwi It is true that Bitcoin is designed to be cheap (and to some extent, even free). But there is a fee built into the system. It's used both as an incentive for miners to prioritize your transactions (so you can pay to have your transaction confirmed quickly), and as a way to combat attacks on the system. Smallish transactions or those that use too little and too young coins as input, will be regarded as spam by the network and dropped/ignored. The client software uses the same rules as most network nodes, so can detect this, and will refuse to create such a transaction without a fee.\n\nIt's not true that in general you can't send 0.005 BTC, but such a small transaction will likely always need a fee to get relayed. It's also not true that in general a fee is required, only for certain transactions. When required, the fee is always calculated per kilobyte of data, and has nothing to do with the amounts in it, as the load on the system for a single transaction is independent of whether it's small or large (in amount). This means that transactions below a certain value will be uneconomical to do.\n\nIt's fair to say that fees are an unsolved issue right now. They cause some confusing, and are also outdated. There are definitely suggests to deal with this in a better way, like have the software suggesting how much is reasonable for the transaction you're created, to have it confirmed relatively quickly. Allowing users to bypass this 'required' fee is also frequently requested, but is seen as too dangerous as the client right now does not deal well with transactions that do not confirm. This is considered a bug, though.\n",
