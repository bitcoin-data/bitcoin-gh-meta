It only takes one doubling of the price to mean you can no longer send a payment of 1 cent, which is pathetic, even physical cash can handle that. And in the past we've seen 10x increases in price happen extremely fast. 1 cent isn't even a micropayment, that's just \"payment\".\r\n\r\nWhatever the ultimate plan is, it doesn't seem like this intermediate state is going to be very helpful. It'll just result in the same problem we have today, hard-coded magic numbers that become inappropriate much faster than they can be changed. Do you really see node operators changing the command line flags?\r\n\r\nI really think we should scrap the word \"dust\". It implies some kind of constant valuation, which Bitcoin doesn't have.

(yes I know you can use the data to prove it doesn't belong in the blockchain, they are SHA1 hashes so have fun if SHA1 is broken)\r\n\r\nAccording to my PGP keyserver data dump there are 3.2 million PGP keys floating around on keyservers. Timestamping every last one of them would just cost about $32,000 at a penny each for fees and vanished bitcoins, and add 120MB to the txout set. $32k may buy a lot of harddrives, but it doesn't buy enough harddrives to really pay the cost of storing those transactions forever.\r\n\r\nNotice how I didn't say \"attacker\". Timestamping is just one of many reasons why demand for transactions is unlimited.\r\n\r\nThe developers are absolutely right to price such junk out of the blockchain but aren't going far enough.",

If someone can convince me otherwise in a credible way, I'm all for it.  I have yet to see that.

Miners can still include the same transactions they can now, though this pull makes 'picocent' payments not get included by default unless they change a threshold setting (useful if the value of Bitcoin changes greatly).\r\n\r\n\"scalable distributed DHT-like\" is a total arm-wave. DHTs are not strongly attack resistant and are generally not very suitable for the interesting challenges in the Bitcoin system. In order to be a decenteralized system all full nodes must inspect all transactions and have rapidly reliable access to the set of spendable outputs. You can make various storage vs bandwidth tradeoffs, but we're constrained on both.\r\n\r\nThe obvious alternative to abuse based on tiny worthless outputs is to add fees, which was satoshi's solution. But with sendmany Satoshi's solution was obviously not aggressive enough (you'd send one fee and N junk outputs). Litecoin addressed that by multiplying the fee by the number of outputs but this quickly becomes obnoxious and still doesn't prevent the abuse. Better to address the creation of worthless tx outputs _directly_ and better to send most of your anti-abuse 'fee' to your destination in order to make the abuse not abuse rather than give it away to a third party.\r\n",

In any event, He is not here to guide us, so we must to the job ourselves, with all of our own faculties.\r\n\r\n@gavinandresen My trust level toward you is extremely high. I see a lot of rubbish in this thread that unjustly questions your judgement. Even so, your initial comments are a bit worrying to me, and make me dream of a better reality. That is, when we recognize that what we have now is rather screwed up, we are best served in the long run by fixing the problem at its root rather than hacking at the branches; antivirals and antibiotics, not analgesics and Band-Aids(TM). I feel you're probably right going this way now on this decision. It's more or a less a \"gotta be done\" thing. But I really wish that folks who are submitting and committing new code will devote equal energy to deeply examining and then refining old code so that the kind of dilemma you faced here doesn't occur.\r\n\r\n(topically tangent aside: I wrestled for a couple of weeks in January refactoring parts of the RPC code, including where it touches the interfaces to the CWallet object. I got some great feedback from @sipa, but not much more attention to my diffs, and I gave up a bit later on when other changes to the RPC code broke the build on my branch. I am not a coder on the level of any of the core devs, but I do know well how to look at a code base that I've come to understand and then identify and fix problems around unit tests, modularity and separation of concerns. I have zero animosity about \"wasted\" work or whatever, but I feel very strongly that not enough attention is being paid to those kinds of issues in the existing codebase. I imagine, given your statement above, that you share the same sort of feeling.)",

WTF?\r\n\r\n@felipelalli (My apologies if I am not reacting to the @pentarh comment you were reacting to. I hope that folks will find this useful in any case.)\r\n\r\nIn the late 1950s to late 1970s, The Establishment, aka The Man, aka The Conspiracy, aka the FBI (Fucking Bavarian Illuminati) and the CIA (Cocksucking Illuminati Assholes) identified, targeted and destroyed the leading lights of a nascent, shining shining movement toward global illumination: MLK. Leary. JFK. Morrison. Malcom X. Lennon. and on and on. The dawning of the Age of Aquarius was strangled in the crib.\r\n\r\nThe failure of that time, which culminated worldwide in '68, was that the movement had FACES, and faces are targets. Destroy the faces, destroy the movement. Take all of the trappings of the new consciousness and recast them as cheap marketing gimmicks: subversion complete. The Hippie pioneers did not drive Volkswagen Beetles because they were some kind of status symbol or mass-consumer-culture signifier. They drove them because they were cheap, simple, minimalistic, trivial to repair and infinitely customizable. It was only later that the cultural imperialists sucked everything good out of the times and pushed it through the marketing meat grinder, until: FahrvergnÃÂ¼gen.\r\n\r\nToday, I believe, a few of the surviving \"secret chiefs\", if you will, who were active back in '68 and before are working as cleverly as they can, before they die, to levitate the Pentagon^w^w^wshift global consciousness in much the same way, but with a fundamentally different and more effective strategy: No more faces. Anonymous. Alan Moore's Guy Fawkes mask. The unknown hero, the nameless brother, the faceless Samaritan. When The Man can't target a Face, it doesn't know what to do, and the field is open for massive gains on the side of the regular people. Today, we don't venerate the Faces. We don the mask. And this Face Book? Oh! Do you jest, or do you not feel the power you have lost?\r\n\r\nWhoever or whatever Satoshi is or was knew this, and acted right from the start on that knowledge. No face, no target. Produce brilliance, show some people, fade away into legend.\r\n\r\nThere is a teaching in Zen Buddhism which I will paraphrase here: If you meet Satoshi on the road, KILL HIM.",

That my little post on the forums lead to 7000 views in just a few hours shows how little people know and understand about these changes even taking trolls into account. @petertodd is right to point out how few people understand these issues in the wider community and how we still present this misleading \"low or no fees\" message without any plan for how that will actually be achieved. If investors are putting money into Bitcoin thinking it is something it is not, this is a serious problem. What I see is people sinking money into Bitcoin assuming it will be a cheap payment platform, and people sinking money assuming it will be decentralized, and the way things are going with the foundation and Gavin I do not see how it will be both, but none of this is being effectively communicated outside of a small number of developers and the occasional interested person like myself.\r\n\r\nAlso without a way for nodes to relay dust transactions, given that 0.8.2 nodes will not identify themselves, yes, the change really is blocking dust entirely.

Obviously problems arise when, in the case of color coins, they are actually multiplying the BTC value of a very small amount(ie. 0.000001 BTC is colored to be worth 1 silver gram which has it's own BTC value of 0.2039 - at the time of writing) - this will clearly have fatal effects on the mining economy because **you have detached real value from BTC units**.  Various ideas have been proposed to circumvent any kind of regulations, but no proposals offer a way to create a long-term viable transaction economy that reflects the actual consent of the users.",

The minimum output does this because data spam doesn't spend outputs.\r\n\r\nOptions for affected businesses: combine payments together so that the lump sum is >54uBTC or connect directly to a miner willing to mine your transactions. Off-chain is possible too with something like EasyWallet, but then your customer needs an easywallet account. (they have an API) Consider that Bitcoin may not yet be right for you.\r\n\r\nLong-term outlook: We don't really know yet. If tx fees rising can threaten your business take into account that they may be more expensive in the future (10x is quite possible) and there may be very little you or the development team can do about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've got better things to do than post it though: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1dqsul/warning_if_you_use_microtransactions_they_will/c9t4ea5",

      "body" : "1) I note the distinct lack of discussion surrounding https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=130450.0 and its pull request.\r\n\r\n2) This issue certainly deserves better communication, but think the trolling (reddit/bitcointalk) by @johndillon was premature and exaggerated, because there is still plenty of time and opportunity in the release cycle for comments.  Usually the time prior to -rc1 release is used to write the communications that appear in -rc1.  The -rc1 release announcement then describes the changes, including rationale and impact.\r\n\r\n-rc1 release initiates a phase of public testing and comment.  If the community really dislikes a particular change, this testing phase is yet another opportunity to make that known.\r\n\r\n3) Most importantly...\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of remote workers (miners) do not seem to care at all about mining policies, in practice.  Pools' mining policies are incredibly opaque, few miners show deep interest in mining policy, and few pool operators show much interest in deep thinking about mining policies, transaction selection, and various economic incentives.  Even a lot of smart, engaged pool operators wind up preferring unmodified (or close to it) bitcoind for reasons of reduced complexity.\r\n\r\nTherefore, just wanting -- quite rationally -- to get paid for mining, it is the sad reality that the block subsidy (currently 25.0 BTC) reduces transaction fees to the economic equivalent of statistical noise.  The long term cost of generating and storing economically worthless transaction outputs is simply not transmitted to users or miners.  Nor, really, is the short term cost.  The economic signalling of the block subsidy drowns the rest out.\r\n\r\nThe cost is currently borne entirely by \"the cloud\", the all-volunteer P2P network of full nodes.  The only modicum of behavior signalling we see there is a decreasing number of full nodes, and an increasing amount of P2P traffic.\r\n\r\nWhat does all this add up to?  The answer is lies in the free market.  Move transaction fees away from hardcoded limits, and towards something more dynamic, with economic feedback between merchants, users and miners.\r\n\r\nThese hardcoded anti-spam limits have existed for years, originally starting out at 0.01 BTC.  Transactions have always been filtered.  Anything outside a small set of \"standard\" transactions are deemed \"non-standard\", and will be filtered (not relayed).  Again, policy has been in place for years.\r\n\r\nThe fee limits were lowered over time, but still hardcoded.  This latest change makes this limit configurable, moving one step closer to the goal of users being able to react rapidly to changes in miner policy or bitcoin value.  One step closer to a freer market.\r\n\r\nAlso introduced is an anti-spam rule that avoids relaying transactions whose value is below that of the transaction fee required to send it.  This rule self-adjusts over time, as the \"tx fee required to send\" changes over time.  In a dynamic fee market, it might change a lot.\r\n\r\nIt is unavoidable that tiny transactions worth fractions-of-a-penny may be easily abused for data transmission and storage.  We have already been burdened with megabytes worth of wikileaks data, GPG encrypted data, and the PGP fingerprint strong set, so this is not a theoretical problem.  These files are stored as bitcoin transactions with values around 0.00000001.",

As I said above, I've run into people putting serious effort into starting payment-dependent Bitcoin businesses who don't even know that there is a blocksize limit.\r\n\r\n3)\r\n\r\nhttp://blockchain.info/charts/cost-per-transaction\r\n\r\nIf the block subsidy was not statistical noise, transactions would have to cost something more like $1 each for 1MB blocks, $10 each to equal the block subsidy. On the other hand, if transactions were still cheap, say a penny each, well, you've just made the data storage problem something like 100 to 1000 times worse.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want the blocksize to grow at the maximum rate possible, 52GB/year, the answer does *not* lie in the free market until genuine economic activity is such that transaction fees are expensive. It relies on taking advantage of miner persuasion, as we already do.\r\n\r\nAnyway users *can't* react rapidly to changes in miner policy or Bitcoin value without reasonable alternatives. I suspect *without* alternatives blockchain space is more like diesel and gasoline in terms of supply and demand - you absolutely need it and if you can't get it you just close up shop instead and that section of the economy goes out of business.

Provided there is genuine economic demand for 100% of the blockspace available the mining-side code implements a perfectly reasonable free market as-is, and that demand could show up tomorrow for all we know.

The block subsidy has nothing to do with that - while hashers don't care much, mining pool operators care a lot about that extra percentage point that fees can get. Of course, they also care about orphans, so with the big subsidy economically rational fees are actually going to remain high for most miners no matter what, especially if Bitcoin mining is as decentralized as it should be.",

      "body" : "My business would not rely on micro-transactions at all, and the fact that no one is getting why I'm *still* going to move away from Bitcoin if this goes through is what should worry everyone\r\n\r\n@gavinandresen @gmaxwell All you are discussing and discussing is whether this change is sound technically. Since you already admitted in your own words that this change is supposed to be temporary and should be replaced by a solid system later on goes to show that no, it's not. It's a dirty, quick fix for a problem that goes way beyond a simple quick change - and it should never be approached in such a half-arsed way.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not even relevant. What is relevant here is that you both suffer from something I like to call \"developer-blindness\". You think you know better than anyone else, and maybe you do, but that does not matter. The majority of users does *not* want this change. In fact, the majority of users are opposed to this change citing various real arguments. Arguments you might not agree with. Arguments you might consider less relevant than your own. Arguments nonetheless.\r\n\r\nIt is not and should never be your place to impose a change on the community that is clearly not wanted. Again, if miners would have such huge trouble with these transactions, they would end up implementing their own filter. What you are doing is to massacre the protocol for everyone. Even worse, by dictating such an unpopular change, you kill the credibility of Bitcoin as a whole.\r\n\r\nI, personally, will never trust the potential, aspiration and philosophy behind Bitcoin again if this gets implemented, and I'm not the only one. I don't need to tell you how vulnerable Bitcoin still is. Right now, Bitcoin is growing tremendously, not because the software behind it is mature in every possible way, but because of the idea behind it. You are risking to put this idea in danger.",

You can spend transaction inputs regardless of how small they are with this patch, and we have every reason to make that possible, even easier, to try to reduce the UTXO set size.\r\n\r\nThe only time what you are suggesting might apply is if we were desperate enough to reduce the UTXO set size that we were willing to make old coins unspendable, and we're literally multiple orders of magnitude away from even considering that step. Not to mention you said \"store coins forever\"...\r\n\r\nDon't confuse people.",

The end result being is that normal users are discouraged from sending dust and automatic services simply work their way around the new rules.\r\n\r\nI do not see this patch reducing spam for games like satoshidice and our own reverse dice as operators are likely to increase the loss payout multipler to be higher than 0.000055 btc. The main game that it will effect (for us) is our roulette game, if this is the way forward for bitcoin then we shall have to adapt. ",

Creating very tiny outputsÃ¢ÂÂ independently of how many are createdÃ¢ÂÂ is harmful because it costs users more in fees to clean them up then they yield, so they never get cleaned up. Actual economic transactions are not intended to be effected by this, so I think your commentary about \"I do not see this patch reducing spam\" is confused. This change in behavior targets exactly the specific activities it is intended to target. The intended effect is to decrease the amount of outputs which are too worthless to redeem (negative-effective-value-payments) and the unredeemable data storage transactions.\r\n\r\nServices which simply inefficiently generate large numbers of transactions (I assume this is what you mean by spam?) get to compete with fees and priority for space in the blockchain. This patch isn't intended to do anything with respect to that.",

I would submit that most of us who are on bitcoin today have obtained their first portion of a bitcoin not because they mined it straightaway, but because they obtained it through a BunnyRun or a website visit that paid out in uBTC for visits, views, or microtasks performed.  Speaking on the latter, whether or not you consider them a significant part of the bitcoin economy is irrelevant.  You have disregarded their voices by acting in an \"open\" forum to act in this way without a more open consultation.\r\n\r\nGithub is not a proper forum to discuss this kind of matter.  It is the place where changes are ultimately made that affect the code, yes.  But when such changes are so large as to concern the manner in which an entire user base can utilize an increasingly trusted method of transaction, and the development under discussion is a surprise or even completely unknown to many who are about to be affected by it, in no small part because of the behavior of the developers, this is entirely unacceptable.  The behavior I am seeing here in the development of this pull request, is reminiscent of the behavior not of the open community of coders and innovators, but rather reminds me of the ITU (International Telecommunication Union), the closed-door body for which only governments have a vote.\r\n\r\nNo, this is not an issue of numbers, or formulae, or how to best prevent bitcoin from being DDOS'd. \r\n\r\nThe issue here, at its core, is was this a legitimate way to address the microtransaction issue?\r\n\r\nWas Github truly used to solicit views and ideas of Bitcoin users?\r\n\r\nThe answer is no.  A small group of developers huddled together and pushed this through.  This change should be pulled back until the larger community's views can be taken into account and votes on the matter can be taken outside of Github.  There are a number of online deliberative tools that are available to perform such tasks.  Solicitation of ideas from a larger community, prioritization of appropriate solutions, and larger community selection through ranking or vote on which solutions are the best to address a problem facing the community, this must always come before decisions are made.\r\n\r\nThis is not like other things.  You are not developing a fix for Cryptocat or talking solutions for libpurple problems in Pidgin / OTR.  \r\n\r\nThere is a larger community, whose voice must be heard, outside of Github.\r\n\r\nThis is Bitcoin.

There are no network rules affected, and everyone is free to set whatever relay fee price they believe is right for the network.

However, it is just a stopgap solution and the intention for the near future is replacing it with a mechanism to detect what fees get confirmed and which don't and set the relay policy based on that, so we can evolve towards a free market where users bid for space in blocks.",

It seems Bitcoin is becoming just a replacement for Western Union type of transfers instead of being a full-fledged currency of the Internet with some unique features - where are contracts?\r\nThe decision making process regarding Bitcoin development is becoming a problem. It is too centralized and not democratic/market driven enough. Fees should be determined by market so developers should focus on features relating to fee management rather than hardcoding another magic number.\r\nAs Bitcoin's value is ultimately set by the market, I am personally taking some money out of Bitcoin until some long-term market solution for fees management is proposed.",

BIP-16 was a change of network rule which required consent of the miners, this is just a change in client behavior. If you want your bitcoin client to behave differently you can use a different client, create a fork of The Bitcoin Foundation's client or [bother](http://litecoin.org/) [someone](https://ripple.com/) [else](http://solidcoin.info/).\r\n\r\nDevelopers, your patience and your desire for community process is like that of a saint, you are all wonderful people. Right now though, your good will is becoming part of the problem. Any time there is public disagreement between developers over any technical detail, someone is going to use that issue as a wedge to divide the dev community and tie up the process. In regards to developer back-channels, this is something we need more of, not less. It doesn't have to be a dark room with cigar smoke and plush curtains, a real-names-only mailing list should be more than adequate to maintain civility. Every time you so patiently try to explain the reality of the issue to the same person one more time around, you miss the point. This is not a misunderstanding, it is a negotiation and you are letting these people run roughshod over you!\r\n\r\nWhat does the development process need? We needs a charismatic leader. We need someone who can source ideas and opinions from users, developers, and stakeholders alike, merge them into policy and then defend that policy with religious zealotry. We need someone with the programming skill to command respect from all developers for it is the master who leads from the front. We need someone with the credibility to arbitrate disagreements between developers without allowing them to bubble up into public view where idlers will no doubt incite them further. We need a Linus.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCaleb",

That was off-chain no-fee, so very small transactions could technically be handled.  This also allowed for micro-transactions on mobile (initially, Android) and other things (off blockchain micro-transactions between Coinbase users would appear to be free to the user).  The question seems to be how would this be done on the network and the answer is, I think, tiny transactions cannot exist alone.\r\n\r\nMany 'tiny transactions' (we could call it a micro-donation, too) could be bundled in a wallet ~ [some concepts and ideas for that are shown here](http://abis.io).  Apart from that, more specific to the question floated above, \r\n\r\n\"Assuming someone pushes a no-fee dust-transaction, does it ever get verified?\"  \r\n\r\nThe answer would seem to be no, if it is truly no-fee and is in the network, but I say \"seem to be,\" because I imagine the idea of a \"[wallet dusting feature](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4079#issuecomment-41010593)\" ~ as expressed by @gmaxwell ~ or a \"[specialized collector](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4079)\" to process small change and tiny txouts, which potentially could be used (in part) to gather dust together to provide for the fee in the floating or smart fee framework within the context of 0.10.  (Thus transactions could be given priority which is variable depending upon conditions.)\r\n\r\nExamining many small transactions together with a fee, and assuming a sort of bundling of many tiny transactions, one can imagine all kinds of possibilities in Core especially with the floating or smart fee framework.
