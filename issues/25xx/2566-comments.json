It would be great if you could assist me in trying to recover that\nprivate key so i can move them to a wallet that actualy has a private key\n(which I already created and own)\nI'm willing to reward you for this... current value for 1 onion is about $3\nor even a bit more...\nIf you can help me fix this problem by some simple guidance.. I'll send you\na very nice reward for this. You can count on it.\n\nLet me know if you can assist me in this one.\n\n\nWith friendly regards,\n\n\nWebwakko\n\n2017-12-07 17:45 GMT+01:00 Andrew Chow <notifications@github.com>:\n\n> @webwakko <https://github.com/webwakko> Please see #10952\n> <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10952> which actually allows for\n> the default key to not be in the wallet.
