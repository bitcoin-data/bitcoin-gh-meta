      "body" : "I'm going to very much disagree with the high-level direction here. The thing about coin selection, is that you are just managing a bunch of trade-offs and without knowing future spending patterns (and their fee rates) you're shooting in the dark.\r\n\r\nThe idea of aggressively consolidating (by using small inputs) is generally not a good one for both privacy and fees (for example, it makes it harder to use exact-change later), and really is conflating two different problems (there should instead be a `consolidate` command, that cleans up your utxo with a super low fee transaction).\r\n\r\nI kind of believe that you can't really get far in coin selection unless you add a \"future spend cost\" argument, that lets it know how much you're expecting to pay in the future. For consumer wallets this could even just be the average fee (for the conf target they're using) for the last month. \r\n\r\nBut honestly, coin selection is a very hard problem. I really strongly think the sane way forward for core is by making coin-selection have a well defined interface and a sort of plugin architecture. One size will never fit all, and the best way to allow things to move forward would be to allow people to experiment and work with it easily.\r\n\r\nFor anyone interested in coin selection, I'd like to shill https://www.coinsayer.com/  which uses a lot of techniques not very applicable to core ( like running several constraint solvers and models), but I think the API itself is quite interesting (as it's quite general and powerful, supporting even generating conflicts for things like bip125) and better models the problem than previously done. Also there's a demo server  (freeapi) running, which everyone is free to hammer as hard as the want if you want to test specific scenarios or try measure the uplift. ",
