As a result, there are many invocations of the `REF` macro which in addition to changing the reference type also changes the constness. This is unnecessary in C++11 as we can use rvalue references now instead.\r\n\r\nThe first commit is an extra simplification we can make that removes the duplication of code between `READWRITE` and `READWRITEMANY` (and related functions).",
