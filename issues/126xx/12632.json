   "body" : "I sometimes need to attach different wallets to my Bitcoin Core instance only to use certain RPC calls. I do not need up to date transaction or balance information. Basically I only want to perform `dumpwallet`. Would it be feasible to add a startup mode where rescanning and other optional work is skipped? Maybe block verification could also be skipped.\r\n\r\nRescanning takes about 2h on my fairly recent CPU on an SSD. It would be very useful if this step could be skipped.",
