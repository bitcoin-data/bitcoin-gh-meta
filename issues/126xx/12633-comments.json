On a technical level, this change reduces the number of possible soft fork deployments from 29 to 13, so functionality is actually being diminished. The _only_ beneficiary is the company owned by OP, which sells hardware implementing the patented version rolling ASICBOOST being standardized by this pull request and associated BIP.\r\n\r\nWithout this, the company is likely to face a public relations nightmare when their use of the patented version roll triggers warnings for full node operators, as it rightly should. Bitcoin Core should not exist to help standardize patented tech, or aid in it's use. At the very least this should *not* be the default behavior. It's hard to not see how this pull request being merged would not significantly benefit the OP and his business. I ask you to consider if it where BITMAIN that had this optimization in their hardware, and they created a similar pull request.",

How are you guys going to define community support?\r\n\r\nI definitely think it needs a very long discussion with input from many parties as this strikes at the core of what is/isn't Bitcoin, and what drives changes even more than the infamous block size debate did - which took years to \"resolve\" and we saw what happened there. A 3rd party has taken a well defined part of the blockheader which has been defined for years and is now attempting to change that and has in fact already forced the change onto the global distributed ledger without permission or consensus - in any other software and if this was a file format rather than a blockchain the actions of this 3rd party would be considered a virus.\r\n\r\nWe could assume if the community don't want it but at the same time don't want to be annoyed with messages some sort of code enhancement can be included to knockout these evil ASCIBOOST miners from playing around with parts of the header they are not supposed to?\r\n\r\nI'm personally writing some experimental code that activates 17 forks of the Bitcoin blockchain, so yes this code change does affect me, and as I am the one following spec and the well defined properties of headers I would like some answers.",
