Instead, there is only one. `listtransactions`, though, correctly reports 2 send/receive pairs (4 items in total).\r\n\r\nThe transaction details dialog for this one GUI row does not show an address. Each of the proposed two rows should show one address. The transaction details dialog does show a vout, but that's wrong, too. In my case it shows vout=0 which is arbitrary since the vout=1 case is simply omitted. This is inconsistent with the handling of address information (where the address is not shown at all).\r\n\r\nI think it's important to be able to track self payments accurately in the GUI.",
