I am wiling to clean this up, but are there ways to either give a clearer label instead of (sr) for Cyrillic as it is obviously causing plenty of confusion among translators.\r\n\r\nI don't think we can change the labels for the languages. These are part of the Transifex website. Maybe contacting them about it would make sense, it's possible that they can improve this.\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, is there a way to get in touch with coordinators as they appear to be inactive? I do not see much progress. I am willing to work on this, but I'd need help from coordinators or have a coordinator access in order to work on it properly\r\n\r\nI've also wondered this. I don't know much about transifex besides the API. I don't know how to set coordinators etc.\r\nMaybe @luke-jr does?\r\n",
