That means it is a key for a compressed public key, and as per the wiki documentation you linked, the key should have 0x80 prepended to it *and* 0x01 appended to it. That's an extra 2 bytes, not just 1. Please see [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_import_format#WIF_to_private_key) for how to convert between the WIF format and the private key, and in future please use bitcoin.stackexchange.com for support/usage questions rather than GitHub",
