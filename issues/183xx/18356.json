Please describe.**\r\nI'm building a Docker image that runs bitcoin-qt with a VNC server using [this image](https://github.com/jlesage/docker-baseimage-gui) as base.\r\n\r\nThis works, but I'd like to hide the Welcome screen that opens when you start bitcoin-qt for the first time.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI'm creating a Bitcoin-Qt.conf file BEFORE starting bitcoin-qt itself, with the settings I'd like to use by default, so it should not open the Welcome screen to ask for them, since they are already set up. \r\n\r\nHowever, the Welcome screen still pops up. But it is reading some of my settings, at least the `strDataDir` that is set to my predefined location - but `bPrune` is not (the checkbox to enable/disable the blockchain prune).\r\n\r\n**Question**\r\nHow does bitcoin-qt know that the Welcome screen was already setup?\r\n",
