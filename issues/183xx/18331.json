I'd say all we need to do is run git archive and be done with it forever, see #16734, #6753, #11530 ...\r\n\r\n- [laanwj](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17097#issuecomment-540706025):\r\n> I agree, I've never been a fan of it. I don't think we have any files in the git repository we don't want to ship in the source tarball.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe suggested changes have a downside which is pointed by [**luke-jr**](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17104#issuecomment-540828045): \r\n> ... but the distfile needs to include autogen-generated files.\r\n\r\nThis means that a user is not able to run `./configure && make` right away. One must run `./autogen.sh` at first.\r\n\r\nHere are opinions about mandatory use of `./autogen.sh`:\r\n- [ryanofsky](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16734#issuecomment-534139356):\r\n> It's probably ok to require autogen. I think historically configure scripts were supposed to work on obscure unix systems that would just have a generic shell + make tool + c compiler, and not necessarily need gnu packages like m4 which are needed for autogen.\r\n\r\n- [laanwj](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16734#issuecomment-540729483):\r\n> I also think it's fine to require autogen. What is one dependency more, if you're building from source.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n~Also this PR provides Windows users with ZIP archives of the sources. Additionally the commit ID is stored in these ZIP files as a file comment:~\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote for reviewers: please verify is `git archive` output deterministic?",
