In practice the utxo cache is flushed every 24 hr, but that still works out to about 1 GB of data for a synced node. It regularly takes my cloud nodes ~5 min to shut down with `dbcache=2048`. You also have a LevelDB compaction thread in your back trace which is consistent with a flush to disk happening.\r\n\r\nIf this happens to you again more useful than a GDB backtrace would be to strace all of the threads to completion, which would make it more obvious what is blocking on what. And I would suggest lowering the `dbcache` setting anyway.",
