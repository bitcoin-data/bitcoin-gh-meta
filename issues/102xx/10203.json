If you're using the automated script, then run it with the \"--setup\" command. Afterwards, run it with the \"--build\" command (example: \"contrib/gitian-build.sh -b signer 0.13.0\"). Otherwise ignore this.\r\n\r\nWhat is `signer`? I am reading all the documentation and I can't figure out what to write there. I have a GPG key, but it is not \"gitian key\", I haven't registered with gitian anywhere.",
