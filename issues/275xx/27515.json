   "body" : "Signing arbitrary messages with Bitcoin private keys was always a bit strange. It was designed to handle only the narrow case of single-sig keys, and isn't well-defined for new address types. Worse, it doesn't allow for signing messages with more arbitrary scripts, and its not clear what the semantics for such things would be.\r\n\r\nSadly, the message signing feature is now being abused to \"verify wallets\" as a part of withdraw flows. This prevents Bitcoin users from using anything but an incredibly narrow set of scripts (in many cases *only* P2PKH, not even modern script formats, and definitely not multisig).\r\n\r\nRather than trying to rework it to avoid these things breaking Bitcoin, it seems like it'd be much better to simply remove the message signing logic entirely. If someone comes along with a proposal that considers a broader set of scripts and a more sensible design that could be considered.",
