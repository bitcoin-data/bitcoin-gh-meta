   "body" : "_This is an early draft to get some feedback on the design. It compiles, but some obvious things are missing._\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new connection type for relaying sensitive data (our own transactions) with the following properties:\r\n* started whenever there are local unbroadcast transactions to be sent\r\n* only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n* opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n* after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer and the connection is closed\r\n* ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed\r\n\r\nThis hooks the new functionality into the existent flow which is in line with everything else, but it is hard to follow in the code because it is scattered in a few places. Another option is to fire a new thread and to everything synchronously in it, that would be easy to follow as everything about this new functionality will be in one place, but it will be at odds with the rest of the code base.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [ ] Disable if `-connect` is used or Tor and I2P are not reachable\r\n* [ ] Use I2P transient connections even if listening on I2P\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to address:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450\r\n",
