   "body" : "Add an RPC to get prioritised transactions (also tells you whether the tx is in mempool or not), helping users clean up `mapDeltas` manually. When `CTxMemPool::PrioritiseTransaction` sets a delta to 0, remove the entry from `mapDeltas`.\r\n\r\nMotivation / Background\r\n- `mapDeltas` entries are never removed from mapDeltas except when the tx is mined in a block or conflicted.\r\n\t- Mostly it is a feature to allow `prioritisetransaction` for a tx that isn't in the mempool {yet, anymore}. A user can may resbumit a tx and it retains its priority, or mark a tx as \"definitely accept\" before it is seen.\r\n\t- Since #8448, `mapDeltas` is persisted to mempool.dat and loaded on restart. This is also good, otherwise we lose prioritisation on restart.\r\n\t- Note the removal due to block/conflict is only done when `removeForBlock` is called, i.e. when the block is received. If you load a mempool.dat containing `mapDeltas` with transactions that were mined already (e.g. the file was saved prior to the last few blocks), you don't delete them.\r\n\t- Related: #4818 and #6464.\r\n- There is no way to query the node for not-in-mempool `mapDeltas`. If you add a priority and forget what the value was, the only way to get that information is to inspect mempool.dat.\r\n- Calling `prioritisetransaction` with an inverse value does not remove it from `mapDeltas`, it just sets the value to 0. It disappears on a restart (`LoadMempool` checks if delta is 0), but that might not happen for a while.\r\n\r\nAdded together, if a user calls `prioritisetransaction` very regularly and not all those transactions get mined/conflicted, `mapDeltas` might keep lots of entries of delta=0 around. A user should clean up the not-in-mempool prioritisations, but that's currently difficult without keeping track of what those txids/amounts are.",
