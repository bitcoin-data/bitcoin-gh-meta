When I set `-prune=550` the blocks dir ends up somewhere between 3 and 5 GB. Judging by the blkâ¦.dat timestamps it seems that both the snapshot and background IBD hold on to more blocks than they should. Tested on Ubuntu 23.04 and with coinstats- and blockfilterindex enabled. The first time I tested I allowed the node to sync for a few hours before loading the snapshot, the second time I loaded the snapshot almost immediately.",

      "body" : "I've done a number of runs here with some combination of indexing and pruning, and I think this is in about as good a shape as it can be, with the following caveat:\r\n\r\nWhen using assumeutxo with pruning and indexing, the snapshot chainstate cannot be pruned because of how we handle indexing during bg sync. Since the snapshot chainstate isn't indexed until after the background sync completes (in order to avoid out-of-order indexation), we aren't able to prune the snapshot chainstate based upon the prune blocks that the indices configure.\r\n\r\nSo the upshot of all this is that pruning, when used with assumeutxo and indexing, is basically best-effort. I think that's an okay state as long as we're clear about it to end users. Probably merits some kind of GUI alert which I think can be done later.\r\n\r\nAfter bg sync completes, we're in a pretty good state (`-blockfilterindex` + `-coinstatsindex` + `-prune=550`):\r\n```\r\n777M    /home/james/tmp/bitcoin-au-testing/blocks\r\ntotal 667M\r\ndrwx------ 3 james users 4.0K May 12 07:02 .\r\ndrwx------ 5 james users 4.0K May 12 10:34 ..\r\n-rw------- 1 james users 128M May 11 21:24 blk00014.dat\r\n-rw------- 1 james users 128M May 11 21:24 blk00015.dat\r\n-rw------- 1 james users 127M May 11 21:24 blk00016.dat\r\n-rw------- 1 james users 128M May 12 05:04 blk00017.dat\r\n-rw------- 1 james users  32M May 12 06:41 blk02910.dat\r\n-rw------- 1 james users  48M May 12 10:31 blk03593.dat\r\ndrwx------ 2 james users 4.0K May 12 10:34 index\r\n-rw------- 1 james users  18M May 11 21:24 rev00014.dat\r\n-rw------- 1 james users  18M May 11 21:24 rev00015.dat\r\n-rw------- 1 james users  18M May 11 21:24 rev00016.dat\r\n-rw------- 1 james users  16M May 12 05:04 rev00017.dat\r\n-rw------- 1 james users 3.3M May 12 06:41 rev02910.dat\r\n-rw------- 1 james users 6.0M May 12 10:31 rev03593.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThrough the last few days of testing, I did find that I forgot to the divide the prune target by the number of chainstates outstanding, so that may have created some of the weirdness @Sjors was seeing. But otherwise I just think that enabling all these features together results in the necessary trade-off of blowing out the pruning budget.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting that based on the current size of blocks over the last few weeks, the 244 block trailing prune window is potentially going to result in over 550MB of block data, which is our lowest allowable target.",

I'd agree that this is not a problem as long as it is clearly communicated to the user, e.g. by putting a well-visible warning into the `loadtxoutset` RPC help. The ultra-conservative approach here would be to simply throw an error if a snapshot is loaded on a node that was started with both pruning and an index enabled (if keeping the `-prune` target promise has absolute highest priority), but that seems to be too limiting.\r\n\r\n",
