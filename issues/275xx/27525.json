However, for new users or those unfamiliar with the command line, this step might not be obvious.)\r\n\r\nAdded: Instructions on verifying the build was successful and the GUI was compiled.\r\n(Rationale: After compiling the Bitcoin Core software, it's important to verify that the build was successful and that the GUI, if compiled, is functional. This step helps users confirm that the installation process is complete and that the software is ready to use.)",
