   "body" : "There has been a lot of spam on bitcoin for several months now, it is urgent to do something to stop the spam of Inscriptions  on the chain. A whole bunch of shitcoins arrived because of brc-20 and strips the least informed bitcoiners on these topics. a lot of bitcoiners praise the assets of bitcoin such as the fact that it is a hard currency unlike shitcoins so why let this thing proliferate on the chain?\r\n\r\nI hope that the developers will not just refuse this request and especially that they will take a little of their time to make this code optional for example with an `Inscription=0` in the file `bitcoin.conf`",
