      "body" : "The RPC coverage works by comparing the invoked RPCs with the full list of available RPC commands per `bitcoin-cli help`. What seems to be problem is that the `rpc_interface.txt` reference-list that we create as part of [`write_all_rpc_commands()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/test_framework/coverage.py#L80) doesn't contain the wallet RPC commands.\r\n\r\nBecause this is per test run (`rpc_interface.txt` is created once per coverage directory), a possible issue could be that the first time we invoke `help` through `write_all_rpc_commands()` we do not support the wallet.\r\n\r\nDigging a bit deeper it seems that this is indeed the case. The issue is with the cache-creation that happens as part of test runner's initialization: \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/322ec63b01499c1ec52d3912ee382ebd59f2366b/test/functional/test_runner.py#L550-L553\r\n\r\nAt this point, [`create_cache.py`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/create_cache.py) initializes the testing framework in order to \"manually\" create the cached blockchain before running any tests. But part of cache-creation is [starting the node](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/test_framework/test_framework.py#L795) which [kickstarts the rpc coverage logic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/test_framework/test_framework.py#L547-L548), but with a node that doesn't have a wallet.\r\n\r\nIf we don't pass the `--coveragedir` as part of the `flags` that we give to `create_cache.py` we can avoid this issue, but just a reordering of cache-creation<>coverage-initialization pushes the issue to the next coverage-initialization which in that case will be the first test of the test-runner. If the node in that first test doesn't have a wallet, the issue remains.",
