I don't quite understand what \"user space\" means, when it has been used in comments here (and in other PRs), as we are not the Linux Kernel, but I assume it's a somewhat less direct way of saying backwards compatibility/continuity?\r\n\r\nIn any case, as far as I'm aware, we offer no special \"backwards compatiblity\", or other, guarantees for our CLI tools, and I don't really think we should. Doing so would put us in an awkward position, of having our RPCs backwards compatibility requirements, extended to those tools (consumers, which just happen to exist in this codebase).\r\n\r\nWe don't want to be in position where we can't change an RPC, to stop it doing something possibly incorrect/illogical, just because a CLI tool happens to call that RPC. These tools shouldn't get any special treatment, and, as far as I'm concerned, should just adapt to any RPC changes we might make, like every other consumer (internal or external) of that RPC.",
