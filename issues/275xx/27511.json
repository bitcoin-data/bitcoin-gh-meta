   "body" : "implements https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26907. split off from #26988 to keep RPC, CLI discussions separate.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new RPC `getaddrmaninfo`which returns the count of addresses in the new/tried table of a node's addrman broken down by network type. This would be useful for users who want to see the distribution of addresses from different networks across new/tried table in the addrman.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n$ getaddrmaninfo\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n{                   (json object) json object with network type as keys\r\n  \"network\" : {     (json object) The network (ipv4, ipv6, onion, i2p, cjdns)\r\n    \"new\" : n,      (numeric) number of addresses in new table\r\n    \"tried\" : n,    (numeric) number of addresses in tried table\r\n    \"total\" : n     (numeric) total number of addresses in both new/tried tables from a network\r\n  },\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### additional context from [original PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26988)\r\n\r\n1. network coverage tests were skipped because thereâs a small chance that addresses from different networks could hash to the same bucket and cause count of different network addresses in the tests to fail. see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26988#discussion_r1137596851.\r\n2. #26988 uses this RPC in -addrinfo CLI. Slight preference for keeping the RPC hidden since this info will mostly be useful to only super users. see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26988#discussion_r1173964808.",
