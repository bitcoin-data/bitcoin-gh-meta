I run four public nodes (24.0.1) with different server hosts, and all four of them were spinning a CPU core at 100% and experiencing slowness with block/transaction handling when I checked them yesterday, two to the point where they started occasionally dropping connectivity to my private nodes. Like I mentioned, one 24.0.1 node which does not accept incoming connections (but is connected to untrusted nodes) did not have this issue. The other private nodes still run 23.0.0 and also do not have any issues, though these only connect through my own public nodes so they aren't directly exposed to untrusted nodes.",

It seems to be spent in `make_heap` in `net_processing.cpp` which in turn seems to be due to the internal queues for which txs need to be INVed to which peers growing much too large (I've observed >60,000 entries in each of 6 peers, eg). It seems to be exacerbated by a combination of inbound peers that aren't really relaying transactions (so the queue is only being cleared when we send things, so effectively half or a third of the rate compared to if they were sending INVs as well) and other peers sending txs to us at a rate much faster than the network can actually support.\r\n\r\nThat's a different bug though, so I'll open it up as a different issue after getting some better data...",

This is probably because the node has 180 connected peers, and 140+ of those have both bytessent_per_msg.inv and bytesrecv_per_msg.inv over 100000, so disconnecting 15 of them for not sending any probably doesn't do much..\r\n\r\nBased on what you say about it being a different bug I assume that it is not an issue introduced with 24.0, but I reverted one of the nodes to 23.0 just to verify.",

In fact the highest counts on all of my public nodes is my private nodes, but not by much.\r\n\r\nA notable change happened yesterday (May 9th) around 14:25 UTC where the CPU load on all the public nodes dropped drastically at the same time, and they all look normal at present. The high-fee BRC-20 token spam we were seeing also appear to have quieted down a bit, so it seems likely that the issues were simply related to that. Unless it starts back up it might be hard to diagnose this further without artificially generating a similar traffic pattern.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the command originally provided by @ajtowns which lists the peer addresses with the inv numbers was:\r\n\r\n`bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo | jq -j '.[] | (.bytessent_per_msg.inv, \" \", .bytesrecv_per_msg.inv, \" \", .addr, \"\\n\")' | grep ' null ' | sort -n`\r\n\r\n(Remove the `| grep ' null '` part to show nodes that are also sending invs.)\r\n\r\nEdit: I misread your post, I see you are referring to the headers field. I'm not seeing any anomalous hits at present, and it doesn't seem consistent with the behavior I was seeing with gradual increase of CPU usage over time, but I'll check it to rule it out if the problem reappears.",
