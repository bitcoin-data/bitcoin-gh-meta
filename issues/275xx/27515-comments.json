That may sound suboptimal, but a scheme that's restricted by design to some subset cannot do better either.\n\nThe question is just getting it implemented and accepted; perhaps there is just not enough animus to spend effort on. But if that's the case, I'm not sure if any (simpler, more restrictive?) alternative is going to fare much better.\n\nIn any case, I'm not in favor of dropping this feature until there is a reasonable more flexible alternative available and adopted. Bitcoin Core, as a wallet, isn't all that important in the market I think, so dropping support for a feature that seems abused by some is more likely to just drive people who rely on to other wallets rather than effect change in how it's used.",
