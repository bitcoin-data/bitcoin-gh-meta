   "body" : "This PR aims to defaults initialise various class members and make redundant several calls to SetNull methods for those classes. This makes the default constructor for a few classes without any other constructors redundant as well but rather than remove them I'll created them with default in case of compiler complaints.\r\n\r\n- Default initialise m_data member in base_blob which makes calls to SetNull on uint256 redundant, create  base_blob() with default rather than remove in case of compiler complaints.\r\n- Default initialise members in CBlockFileInfo and remove constructor which called SetNull, create  CBlockFileInfo() with default.\r\n- Default initialise members of CBlockHeader and remove constructor which called SetNull, create  CBlockHeader() with default.\r\n- Default initialise fChecked member of CBlock and remove constructor which called SetNull as CBlockHeader no longer requires this call and the vtx member will already be clear. Create  CBlock() with default.\r\n- Default initialise type in CInv and remove constructor which set type and called SetNull on the hash member. Create  CInv() with default.",
