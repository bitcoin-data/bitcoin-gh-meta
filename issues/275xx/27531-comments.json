The thing I don't understand is why rebasing fixes the problem when rerunning the task doesn't fix the problem.\r\n\r\nThis failure doesn't seem to have anything to do with the contents of the PR, so I wouldn't expect pushing a rebased version of the PR to change anything. How is rebasing actually different than rerunning? Does a github push clear some cirrus cache that would otherwise not be cleared? I think I've been confused about this behavior in other contexts so would appreciate any pointers to understand why it happens.",
