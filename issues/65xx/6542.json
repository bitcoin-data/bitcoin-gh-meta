   "body" : "As part of my PhD research on code authorship, we calculated the Truck Factor (TF) of some popular GitHub repositories.\n\nAs you probably know, the [Truck (or Bus) Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) designates the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a truck (or quit) before a project is incapacitated. In our work, we consider that a system is in trouble if more than 50% of its files become orphan (i.e., without a main author).\n\nMore details on our work in this preprint: https://peerj.com/preprints/1233\n\nWe calculated the TF for **Bitcoin** and obtained a value of **3**.\n\nThe developers responsible for this TF are:\n\nWladimir J. van der Laan - author of 27% of the files\nMike Hearn - author of 21% of the files\nPieter Wuille - author of 20% of the files\n\nTo validate our results, we would like to ask **Bitcoin** developers the following three brief questions:\n\n(a) Do you agree that the listed developers are the main developers of **Bitcoin**?\n\n(b) Do you agree that **Bitcoin** will be in trouble if the listed developers leave the project (e.g., if they win in the lottery, to be less morbid)?\n\n(c) Does **Bitcoin** have some characteristics that would attenuate the loss of the listed developers (e.g., detailed documentation)?\n\nThanks in advance for your collaboration,\n\nGuilherme Avelino\nPhD Student\nApplied Software Engineering Group (ASERG)\nUFMG, Brazil\nhttp://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/\n",
