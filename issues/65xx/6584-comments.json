They will eventually disappear when miners start using competitive policies and in the meantime are creating false expectations and confusing users and entrepreneurs. One satoshi is currently 0.000002 usd. I believe that if minimum mined fees rise from 0 to 1 satoshi we're still fine when it comes to attracting adoption (but it would still be a huge step forwards in miners implementing competitive policies).\r\n\r\n> In the future, they should be made optional\r\n\r\nFees are already optional. The policy minimum relay fee is also configurable at run time: you can set it to zero if you want to.\r\n\r\n>  Miner fee can be paid offline, so you can't say it is irrational for them to include such transaction. \r\n\r\nMiner's can still implement their own policy, but offline fees are useless when it comes to DoS network protections (which is what the minimum relay fee is about).\r\nThey could even receive a fee in-chain and give it back offline (on whatever payment method they're using to settle with their customers).\r\n\r\n> Maybe it is a miner's own transaction...\r\n\r\nThey can pay fees to themselves (which is better for their privacy) or, again, implement their own policy.\r\nThe current code is not addressing any of those cases either.\r\n\r\n@chris-belcher That's a benefit for all miners, not just yourself (who are paying the cost). There should be an incentive to reduce/not-increase the utxo size built in the consensus rules (for example ```consensus_size(tx) = real_size(tx) + delta_to_the_utxo_size(tx)```).\r\n\r\nAnyway, since this seems to be controversial, I'm closing it. @jgarzik feel free to cherry pick from here if you still want to keep #6405 open (this one is rebased, passes travis tests and removes a little bit more code).\r\n\r\n@sipa \r\nIf I create a PR that instead of removing the code at least encapsulates it in a function (hopefully a method assuming #6068 gets merged this year) in the policy folder, will it have to wait for #6470 (or its current replacement) too?\r\nWhat if I remove the minRelayTxFee global (make it an attribute in CStandardPolicy) and implement a dynamic minRelayTxFee that uses the fee estimator at the same time?\r\n\r\nI can have the code ready relatively fast if there's interest in reviewing it and it's not going to be blocked by #6470.",
