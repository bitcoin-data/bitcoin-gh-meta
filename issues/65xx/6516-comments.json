There's an open discussion in #6461 as to how to best handle this in the GUI case (I like Luke's suggestion) but it's still not totally clear how to warn appropriately in the daemon/config-file/headless non-GUI case.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some sort of two step process for the initial conversion might make sense as well as some updated terminology?  (ie: instead of pruned nodes, we call them half nodes or lightweight nodes or something that would make people consider pruned nodes as something actually different from a fully validating node with the full blockstore).  This might make it more intuitive for people to go read up on what's going to happen if they \"convert their full nodes to half nodes\" so that they fully understand the ramifications of their actions before they run with something like -converttohalfnode to proceed with the operation...",
