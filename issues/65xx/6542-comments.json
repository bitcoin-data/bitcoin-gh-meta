One of those contributions was importing a third party repository into the code base (the leveldb subtree) which I presume is what is distorting your results.\r\n\r\nOther projects also import large amounts of outside code, and you should take care to avoid misattributing in those cases. (In addition to leveldb, bitcoin also embedds other codebases such as libsecp256k1).\r\n\r\nPieter and Wladimir are substantial contributors. However:  From your text it sounds like you're counting who created files, for many projects including Bitcoin most files are created not as a result of authorship but as a result of moving code around, and so if you are measuring creation this may not be a useful metric. (In our case the most important authors also move code around, but in other projects the metric may be worse).\r\n\r\n(b) I don't know.  We may find out..\r\n\r\n(c) The project has successfully cycled out contributors during its lifetime already. So we do have an existence proof to some extent.\r\n",

IMO only humans can judge a contributors value.\r\nWhy: \r\n1) the fact that you can change one byte in the binary (example: a 7A to a 7B, JP to JPE X86) or one byte in the source that change the whole behavior of the application. Very hard to evaluate quality of such changes by a software.\r\n2) Take the GUI as example. Bitcoin-core's GUI part is relatively large. Is it essentially for bitcoin-core? Probably no.
