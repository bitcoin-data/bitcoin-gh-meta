Space above the soft cap is \"reserve\" space, which can be used for transactions that have some multiple of the relay fee.\n  - When a new tx arrives, if we're under the soft cap, let it in as usual.\n  - If we're above the soft cap, let it in if it can evict enough room for itself in the mempool, using eviction rules that are designed to prevent free relay attacks.\n  - If eviction fails, still let it in if the fee on the transaction exceeds the higher relay fee required to take up reserve space (the threshold increases exponentially as usage grows).\n- Periodically use transactions in the \"reserve\" space to trim the mempool, by aggregating them together as though they are one large transaction with one large fee (which is more likely to be able to evict transaction packages than individual small transactions could).\n\nThere's also a commit here which will expire old transactions (default: 1 week) from the mempool.\n\nStill to do:\n- Consider carefully how we want wallet transactions to interact with this behavior.  In the current version, wallet transactions (and transaction from a disconnected block) get to bypass the mempool limits.  It's not clear that this is being done the right way, and if the right thing happens when wallet transactions get evicted, etc.  Also, we reused the `fLimitFree` variable to accomplish this, which maybe should be renamed if we stick with this approach.\n",

To this end I am curious if there will be incorporated a floating relay fee ~ e.g., @sipa's https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commit/6498673f99da9976df170052648ff2f0026210d2 ~ which was removed by @morcos from a prior iteration in the process of getting to this point.  Shouldn't this (or something like it) be reincorporated at this point, or am I misunderstanding / jumping the gun?\n",

I think this pull is now in good enough shape to try to digest, so that people who are interested can look at this, #6673, #6722, or any other suggestions that are proposed so that we we can pick an approach to focus on, which we can then try to refine.  \n\nI am definitely curious if people have ideas about whether it's problematic for a wallet's transactions to not make it into the mempool in the first place, or get evicted from the mempool?  Or if there are downsides to accepting one's own transactions into your mempool if you can only do so by bypassing the limiting logic?\n\nRegarding your CPFP comment, that seems like an interesting idea but I don't have a clear picture in my head of how that could actually be implemented.  Seems like the tx relay logic would need to be reworked (along with the logic for not re-requesting rejected transactions), and I'm not sure what the logic would be of how to figure out which combinations of transaction bundles to try (the naive algorithm seems like it's n^2 in the length of the chain?  maybe I'm missing something....).\n",
