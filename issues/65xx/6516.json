If you wanted to use your wallet again, you had to download the WHOLE block chain again and for my 2 Mbits/s connection, that means DAYS....\n\nI would like to suggest to include a WARNING message, explaining that you would lose access to your wallet until you download the whole blockchain again  if you turn PRUNE on.\n",
