I wasn't aware either.\r\nIn a way this makes sense, it makes it easy to specify an alternative config file within the datadir. \r\nThough the interaction is a bit convoluted: the configuration file specified using -conf can in turn override `-datadir` :-)\r\n\r\nClosing as expected behavior, then.\r\n",
