      "body" : "Accounts have been removed from Bitcoin Core. However, I doubt that accounts itself influence the run time cost of getbalance, but rather the number of txs does. Also, the wallet should cache the result for each tx, so that the calculation would only happen once and later calls would only iterate all txs.\r\n\r\nWe don't patch old releases for performance improvements, so could you try to reproduce this with 0.18.0 or master? Alternatively, share the approximate number of txs, if they involve watchonly addresses, and the average number of inputs/outputs of those txs. Thanks",
