That way, when the internal nodes rebroadcast, the rebroadcast traverses the gateway, who will forward it to its (new) peers, even when the gateway already had the transactions in its mempool.\r\n\r\nThe rebroadcast mechanism works at all because peers (slowly) rotate, giving new opportunities for relay. When you're behind a singular gateway node, it stops working. The forced relay option fixes this.",
