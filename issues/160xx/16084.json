Remove `CCriticalSection`.\r\n\r\nRationale: `RecursiveMutex` is more descriptive than `CCriticalSection`. The use of two different ways to refer to the same lock type might be somewhat confusing for new contributors.\r\n\r\nContext: `RecursiveMutex` was introduced in #14963 which was merged back in January.",
