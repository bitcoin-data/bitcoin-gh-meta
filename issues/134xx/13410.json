   "body" : "Far from glamorous but somewhat necessary, I think. :)\r\nI'm confident I got every offending tr call but let me know if you see something I've missed.\r\nAlso, I preferred to keep important strings without divisions (e.g. `tr(\"bla\") + \"<b>\" + tr(\"bla\")`) since dividing entire phrases may easily confuse translators and lose context in many languages; so take this into consideration for nits on style.\r\n\r\n_Obs.: The comments [starting here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13374#issuecomment-394386399) is what brought me to it and I believe the final objective could be to ban html tags from translations as a whole (from just adding a check on `update-translations.py ` to, who knows, add a test to fail if some `tr()` with html tag(s) is found in case there's a clean way to do it) but that's another thing for now._",
