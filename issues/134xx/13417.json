   "body" : "As part of a larger effort to decouple net_processing and validation a bit, these are a bunch of simple scope cleanups. I've moved things out of the header file that are only referenced in net_processing and added static (or anonymous namespace) modifiers to everything possible in net_processing. \r\n\r\nThere are a handful of functions which could be static except that they are exposed for the sake of unit testing - these are explicitly commented. There has been some discussion of a compile time annotation, but no conclusion has been reached on that yet.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat related to other prs #12934 #13413 #13407 and will be followed by prs that reduce reliance on cs_main to synchronize data structures which are translation unit local to net_processing",
