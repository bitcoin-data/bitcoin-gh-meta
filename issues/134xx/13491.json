   "body" : "This improves the handling of INVALID in IsMine:\r\n* Extra INVALID conditions were added to `IsMine` (following https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13142/files#r185349057), but these were untested. Add unit tests for them.\r\n* In https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13142#issuecomment-386396975 it was suggested to merge `isInvalid` into the return status. This PR takes a different approach, and removes the `isInvalid` entirely. It was only ever used inside tests, as normal users of IsMine don't care about the reason for non-mine-ness, only whether it is or not. As the unit tests are extensive enough, it seems sufficient to have a black box text (with tests for both compressed and uncompressed keys).\r\n\r\nSome addition code simplification is done as well.\r\n",
