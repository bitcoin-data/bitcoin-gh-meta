Armbian uses some sort of virtualization (?) that when run on an Ubuntu 18.04 VM somehow produces the right build for ARM without having to do anything special. It is however rather slow compared to cross-compilation.\r\n\r\nIt also doesn't use the depends system (yet).\r\n\r\nNonetheless  it's much faster than compiling on the device itself, in case anyone needs a workaround.",
