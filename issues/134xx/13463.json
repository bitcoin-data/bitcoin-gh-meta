   "body" : "This fixes some harmless (but annoying) automake warnings when invokes autogen.sh. The warnings I'm referring to are the ones printed at the very end of running autogen.sh, on my system they look like:\r\nsrc/Makefile.am:547: warning: user target '.mm.o' defined here ...\r\n/usr/share/automake-1.15/am/depend2.am: ... overrides Automake target '.mm.o' defined here\r\n\r\nI did some research on both of these, and here's what I found:\r\n\r\nAutomake has been setting GZIP_ENV since 1998. They set it to --best, we set it to -9n. I'm not sure if the -n is really necessary, but using the override directive suppresses the warning.\r\nAutomake has had a rule for .mm.o targets (used for Objective C++) built in since Automake 1.12.1, which appears to have been released in 2012. Trusty (used by Travis and Gitian) is on Automake 1.14.1. I don't know if it's strictly correct to update this rule, as it has some stuff about QT_INCLUDES and PIE_FLAGS, but the Travis build for Darwin passed on my branch even after removing this rule. If this seems too scary to change maybe we can leave it in.\r\nIt looks like both of these rules were added by @theuni when he did the initial autotools conversion in 2013. These warnings are harmless, but there's no reason not to fix them. While researching these I accidentally stumbled across a few forum posts and GitHub comments from end users who thought the errors meant their Bitcoin build was broken, so that's another reason to fix them.\r\n\r\nBitCoin Change:\r\n[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11013](url)\r\n",
