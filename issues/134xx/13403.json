   "body" : "Official version control system for bitcoin core is based on Github which is not an open-source tool. Moreover recently it was takeover by Microsoft https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/13387 This fact seriously violate the reproducible-builds efforts especially for windows platform, where the whole toolchain from source code (Github), compilers(Visual Studio) up to build and executable environments (Window OS) based on Microsoft solutions only. \r\n\r\nSVN, Mercurial, Git, etc don't work like blockchain and it cannot be really trusted. Moreover not every commits are gpg signed, and there are many possible attacks to corrupt the official source code. \r\n\r\nGitian, which is not fully https://reproducible-builds.org/ only protects the stable builds. Users who want to compile different commits. cannot really validate if the source code they use are not corrupted. The commit zip versions offered by Github (without the history log) could possible contain any kind of malware.\r\n\r\nPlease don't ignore this issue and provide at least some official git mirrors as a reference to your Github code.\r\n\r\n",
