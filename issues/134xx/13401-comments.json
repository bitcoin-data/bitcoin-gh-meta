The work is hard coded in my Bitcoin Core fork at https://github.com/rollmeister/bitcoin-armv8/blob/master/src/crypto/sha256.cpp . When benchmarked as is and the self test is disabled, it is 600% performant and makes nodes operating on cheap arm boards more viable. If successfully completed, I will make it (and the crc32 support also) into a maintainable separate source file and edit the configure.ac and do a pull request. *UPDATE I have made progress and figured out how to route the regular sha256 armv8 transform via the Transform64Wrapper. It is about 20% slower than a fully optimised implementation sha256d computations are still 500% faster than before and will settle for that. It is reindexing the blockchain much faster now.",
