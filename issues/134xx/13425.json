   "body" : "Currently CombineSignatures is used to create the final scriptSig or an input. However ProduceSignature is capable of doing this itself. Using both CombineSignatures and ProduceSignature results in code duplication which is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nTo move the scriptSig construction to ProduceSignatures, the SignatureData class contains two maps to hold pubkeys mapped to signatures, and script ids mapped to scripts. DataFromTransaction is extended to be able to extract signatures, their public keys, and scripts from existing ScriptSigs.\r\n\r\nThe SignaureData are then passed down to SignStep which can use the aforementioned maps to get the signatures, pubkeys, and scripts that it needs, falling back to the actual SigningProvider and SignatureCreator if the data are not available in the SignatureData.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Sign1 and SignN have been removed and their functionality inlined into SignStep since Sign1 is really just a wrapper around CreateSig.\r\n\r\nSince ProduceSignature can produce the final scriptSig or scriptWitness by using SignatureData which has extracted data from the transaction, CombineSignatures is unnecessary as ProduceSignature is able to replicate all of CombineSignatures' functionality.\r\n\r\nThis also furthers BIP 174 support and begins moving towards a BIP 174 style backend.\r\n\r\nThe tests have also been updated to use the new combining methodology.",
