I've just opened up https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8671 which does a very minimal change to prevector tests that should fix the underlying issue; while giving _more useful_ debugging output (the rand seeds needed to recreate this test case). I think there's no reason this can't merge almost immediately as a much needed stopgap to make the tests just run faster.\n\nIn the meantime, I've started working on a boost-free test suite and opened an issue about it https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8670. All necessary features should go in there, such as checkpoints being needed by @sipa.\n\n(@MarcoFalke @laanwj @theuni @jonasschnelli )\n",
