   "body" : "This hack edits the test-driver to output the test suite's stdout (tee'ing it to the file rather than redirecting) and passes -l test_suite so that stuck tests can be seen.\n\nSome hack like this is needed in order for test suites that take a long time, travis will assume they are dead and fail after 10 minutes. (This also helps debug which unittests may be slow). There may be a cleaner way, but as far as I can tell, this is the simplest. \n",
