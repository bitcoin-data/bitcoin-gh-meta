This will allow for more efficient compact/thin block downloads.\n\nThank you for your consideration of this code.\n\nWIP is it requires further testing - e.g. what happens if a node dumps a bunch of invalid orphans and then disconnects - the code still needs to keep track of the disconnected node's misbehaviour...! (EraseOrphan code perhaps moving from FinalizeNode to the point where it is banned...?)\n",
