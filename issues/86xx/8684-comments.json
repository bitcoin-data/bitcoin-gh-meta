IMO dumping the seed (`hdmaster=1`) can be useful.\n\nBut the question is, if the term `hdmaster=1` is confusing... maybe `hdseed=1` would be better.\n",

Why not let the user chose the seed (ie how can you trust a sw doing this for you, even open source))? Or let the user chose a non bip 32 wallet... or a bip 32 wallet where the tree cannot be parsed... etc...\n\nProbably a lot of past discussions about it, currently writing something to try to simplify all this for the users (ie create their own wallet the way they like, btw if there is a link somewhere of the final .dat format I would be glad to get it, did read a lot of your (good) docs but did not find it and this would spare some time compared to finding it in the code) and will comment the choices they have, will let you know if you find an interest.\n\nThat's not a counter productive statement but knowing the theory I find it a kind of amazing to dig into it for real...\n\nAnd now 4 days passed and the complete blockchain is still not there, these are part of the issues that [Convergence](https://github.com/Ayms/node-Tor#convergence) intends to address (sorry not very detailed but the concepts are not vague at all)\n",

Its not an _extended_ master key (`xpriv...`), but someone could argue that it's still a master key (a.k.a. seed).\n",
