I think that's what matter here foremost. If not, this is hopeless, if they are, I don't think it's much of a problem. At least Gentoo already has bitcoin core as a distro package.\r\n",

This was considered a blocker.\r\n* The debian patch policy was considered too strict. (1) not allowing even minor fixes to stable versions. And (2), not providing an upgrade path to newer versions of Bitcoin Core and the risk of new users running outdated versions of Bitcoin Core. No conclusion was reached on (1). No conclusion was reached on (2), but I mentioned that \"backports\" could be used to release newer versions of Bitcoin Core in older releases of debian.\r\n* The PPA was considered superior to a vanilla debian package, especially in light of \"backports\" pacakges. I mentioned that it was lacking a maintainer who is willing to spend time on our current bitcoin/bitcoin PPA.",
