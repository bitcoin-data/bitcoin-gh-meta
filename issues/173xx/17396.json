   "body" : "I've been trying to build for Android on different OSes/Gitian with varying success. Build system is quite the beast and sometimes it doesn't get it right. To make sure it does these three little tweaks make the Android build more robust:\r\n\r\n- disable D-Bus (Android doesn't support it and has its own way to trigger notifications)\r\n- don't flag `-lpthread` when linking Boost, [Bionic has built-in support](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30801752/android-ndk-and-pthread)\r\n- ~~add `-static-libstdc++` to linker flags. This avoids having to bundle `libc++_shared` with CLI apps, still necessary with `bitcoin-qt` though (thanks Sjors)~~\r\n\r\nI think these are small and fairly straightforward so I put them all into this one PR.",
