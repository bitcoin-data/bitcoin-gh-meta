Bitcoin's requirements on hardware resources are heavy compared to other software, and even small bit errors could be actively dangerous (say, in signing, or wallet keys). All in all, it's better to fail on such hardware.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the ability to cope with non-complete sets of blocks and selectively download, would also be necessary for 'smarter' pruning that selectively (non-contiguous, based on a seed) keeps ranges of blocks.\r\n\r\nSo maybe the infrastructure for this could be useful. It wouldn't even need a new flag, it could simply be the reindex that does this when it notices some blocks in the middle are missing.",

I usually follow the [hardlink approach](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8037#issuecomment-220453020) to recover in case of a sudden shutdown (where the cache write-down gets interrupted).\r\n",
