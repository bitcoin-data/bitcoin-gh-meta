   "body" : "Ideally there wouldn't be any globals in Bitcoin Core. However, as we still have globals, they need to be reset between runs of test cases. One way to do this is to run each suite in a different process. `make check` does that. However, `./src/test/test_bitcoin` when run manually or on appveyor is a single process, where all globals are preserved between test cases.\r\n\r\nThis leads to hard to debug issues such as https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15845#pullrequestreview-310852164.\r\n\r\nFix that by resetting the global arg for each test suite. Note that this wont reset the arg between test cases, as the constructor/destructor is not called for them.\r\n\r\nAddendum: This is not a general fix, only for `-segwitheight`. I don't know if clearing all args can be done with today's argsmanager.  Nor do I know if it makes sense. Maybe we want datadir set to a temp path to not risk accidentally corrupting the default data dir?",
