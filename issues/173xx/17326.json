It could mitigate eclipse attack.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 2019-11-07 13:30 UTC**\r\nThere is an eclipse attack scenario when an attacker exploits a victim node restart to force it to connect to new, probably adversarial, peers.\r\n\r\nTrying to re-connect to the before-restart dedicated block-relay-only (#15759) outbound peers mitigates such type of attack.\r\n\r\nThis proposition does _not_:\r\n- prevent all types of eclipse attack\r\n- completely eliminate the type of eclipse attack described above, as re-connection could fail\r\n- make block-relay-only connections persistent as any of them could be dropped by a peer",
