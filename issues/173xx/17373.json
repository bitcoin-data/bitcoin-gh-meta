   "body" : "* The `pwallet->CanGetAddresses()` call in `ReserveDestination::GetReservedDestination` to `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan::GetReservedDestination` so that the sanity check results in a failure when a `ScriptPubKeyMan` individually cannot get a destination, not when any of the `ScriptPubKeyMan`s can't.\r\n* `ScriptPubKeyMan::GetReservedDestination` is changed to return the destination so that future `ScriptPubKeyMan`s can return destinations constructed in other ways. This is implemented for `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` by moving key-to-destination code from `CWallet` to `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`\r\n* In order for `ScriptPubKeyMan` to be generic and work with future `ScriptPubKeyMan`s, `ScriptPubKeyMan::ReturnDestination` is changed to take a `CTxDestination` instead of a `CPubKey`. Since `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` still deals with keys internally, a new map `m_reserved_key_to_index` is added in order to track the keypool indexes that have been reserved.\r\n* A bug is fixed in how the total keypool size is calculated as it was omitting `set_pre_split_keypool` which is a bug.\r\n\r\nSplit from #17261",
