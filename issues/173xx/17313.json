(If so, then the same goes for the `__i386__` case a couple of lines above.)\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the odds of ten `RdRand` failures in a row are astronomically small, so I don't think this is urgent at all. Would be nice to rule out the theoretical possibility though (if such a possibility exists).\r\n\r\nFriendly ping @sipa :)",
