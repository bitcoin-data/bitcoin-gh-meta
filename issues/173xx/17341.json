   "body" : "I'd like to discuss a raw idea for a new feature to repair the block directory, motivated by my first IBD experience some time ago:\r\n\r\nIn case of data corruption of the chainstate, we can perform a `--reindex-chainstate`. \r\nIn case of data corruption of the block index, we can perfom a `--reindex`. \r\n\r\nHowever, if one of the block files is corrupted, both `reindex` and `reindex-chainstate` willÂ  stop at some point, and we are back to IBD, which can be painful in case of a slow connection or limited traffic.Â \r\nFor example, in case of a bad sector in `blk00002.dat`, we would download almost the entire blockchain again, even if we are actually just missing a single block on our disk.\r\n\r\nSo my idea is to create a `repair-blockdir` feature that would scan the block directory (similar to reindex) and check all files for integrity and completeness using the existing block index. In case of mismatches, only the faulty `blk?????.dat` files would be rebuilt, requesting specifically the missing blocks from the p2p network.\r\n\r\nBefore putting any serious work into that: Would such a feature make sense to anyone? Has something similar been attempted before?",
