Assuming it ever made it to another peer.\r\n`REORG` | Removed for reorganization | Block races are rare, so reorgs should be rarer. Also the tx will be reaccepted from the `disconnectpool` later on and then relayed (TODO), so this should never be observable in practise.\r\n`BLOCK` | Removed for block | The other peer will eventually receive the (filtered)block with the tx in it.\r\n`CONFLICT` | Removed for conflict with in-block transaction | The peer won't be able to add the tx to the mempool anyway. No need to waste bandwidth.\r\n`REPLACED` | Removed for replacement | Same as above, send them the higher fee tx instead.\r\n\r\n",
