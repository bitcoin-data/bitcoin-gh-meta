In other words: act like we would have done if `!g_rdseed_supported` in case of `GetRdRand` failure.\r\n\r\nAlternatively:  as long as we keep on using it only as an _additional_ entropy source I guess `uint64_t r1 = 0;` on L145 would be enough.

Closing this issue.\r\n\r\nI guess it still might make sense to initialize `uint64_t r1` to zero just to make it clear for Clang (and human readers) that `r1` cannot be used uninitialized here:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrandom.cpp:136:12: warning: variable 'r1' may be uninitialized when used here [-Wconditional-uninitialized]\r\n    return r1;\r\n           ^~\r\nrandom.cpp:131:16: note: initialize the variable 'r1' to silence this warning\r\n    uint64_t r1;\r\n               ^\r\n                = 0\r\n```",
