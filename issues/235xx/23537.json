   "body" : "I'm not sure if there are any benchmarks that could be easily used to test large scale of hardware wrt type of bottleneck (CPU/SSD bound). I recall I saw something on Twitter mentioned by @sipa but not sure now what it was about.\r\n\r\nBenching CPUs, RAMs and SSDs is my daily job and I've been wanting to have some Bitcoin related benchmarks in my suite. Last month I was rebenching 14 CPUs and I wish I had relevant data on their performance in bitcoin software.\r\n\r\nIt would be best if we could have such benchmarks as part of https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite and https://openbenchmarking.org/ so we could bench all kind of hardware and different versions of bitcoin core with single command. That way we could have a lot of open data which I'm sure could be useful to development.",
