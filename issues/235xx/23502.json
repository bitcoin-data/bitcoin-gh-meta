   "body" : "The current taproot signing code will end up creating transactions which do not meet the feerate target. This is primarily seen when spending a taproot output with the script path. In this scenario, because the public key is known, the dummy signer would incorrectly choose to create a dummy signed transaction that used the key path spend when the actual transaction would use script path. This results in a transaction that has a significantly lower fee rate because script path spends are much larger than key path spends. This is fixed by choosing the witness with the largest stack size rather than the smallest when doing size estimation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this change can result in massively overestimating the transaction fees which is undesirable. A future PR should reduce this effect by allowing users to specify which taproot branch (key or script path, and which script) will be used during signing.\r\n\r\nThere is an additional issue in the PSBT workflow where the sighash type would be appended during finalizing, but not during size estimation. That results in a transaction that is slightly larger than estimated so there is a lower feerate. For the typical case, this is resolved by actually using SIGHASH_DEFAULT (as implemented in #22514). However this should also be followed up to consider whether the sighash type will be included when doing size estimation.\r\n\r\nTests are updated to catch these case. `wallet_taproot.py` will now use a set feerate and check if the result meets that feerate.\r\n\r\nDepends on #22514 ",
