   "body" : "Hi @vincenzopalazzo,\r\n\r\nIMO the change of the same issue in different PR is very confusing for the people that will make a review, and also work in a different file.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in this issue https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23135#pullrequestreview-771245637 I will make all the changes in one PR in the different commit, however some review of the works is very welcome.\r\n\r\nP.S: The PR will include also an additional method inside the test framework, to know more you can look inside https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23127\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @vincenzopalazzo in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23119#issuecomment-938713078_",
