   "body" : "Builds on top of #22341\r\n\r\nFirst this PR introduces a descriptor wallet RPC `addhdseed`. Similar to its legacy wallet counterpart `sethdseed` it either generates a fresh random seed, for use on a blank wallet, or the user can provide a WIF. Unlike `sethdseed` this RPC call does not add keys / fill the keypool.\r\n\r\nThis allows a user to create a blank wallet (`createwallet`), provide it with a seed (`addhdseed`) and then craft custom descriptors. (An alternative approach would to add a `nodescriptors` argument to `createwallet`, but this RPC seems useful anyway)\r\n\r\nAn example use case of this is setting up a multisig between Core and a hardware wallet. After adding the seed to an otherwise empty wallet, the user would call `getxpub m/87'/0'/0'`. They would then combine this `xpub` and origin info with the one from their hardware wallet (e.g. using `hwi --fingerprint .... getxpub m/87'/0'/0'`  and craft a descriptor like `wsh(sorted_multi(2, [...../87'/0'/0']our_xpub, [..../87'/0'/0']their_xpub))`, and import that. The resulting wallet will be able to sign its part of the transaction.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this PR enables to ability descriptors, such as in the multisig example above, in such a way that any `fingerprint` + `xpub` that is covered by our hd seed(s) can be signed for.",
