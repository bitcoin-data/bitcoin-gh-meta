Definitely fine with that, we can possibly state that explicitly in the doc README at a later point. I'm referring to the discussion in #23154 where you suggested (rightly in my view) that when someone drafts a doc they should be clear on whether it is targeted towards developers or users. The assumption would be that if you don't put it in the developer subdirectory it is targeted towards users.",

If you are trying to contribute, you just need to know what ruleinformations to follow and not an in-depth technical discussion.\r\n\r\n> > I will also admit I have kind of a negative reaction to the word \"developer\".

But this is not what I'm saying or assuming. I'm just saying if *I* am using github, and I am exploring or looking for information, I think asking me to think about whether I am a \"developer\" or is irritating, and doesn't tell me whether there's technical information in the folder or just a bunch of rules. If other people think walling off \"developer\" information helpful, then great. I would prefer to organize things topically. Tell me what's in the folder. Don't ask me who I am.",

      "body" : "@jonatack: I'm not seeing why updating these links would be a problem for you other than presenting a one-off task for you to update the links in your repo? The rationale for doing this is not just confusion, it is for making it clear who the document is targeted towards and hence demanding a better standard of documentation. We already have a long list of docs (which will continue to increase over time) with no directory structure or organization and no clarity on who the documents are targeted towards.\r\n\r\nIn addition I'd like to bring some of your docs into this repo (in a developer directory or equivalent) as I think they are better than what is currently in this repo. If we do that we can link to this repo rather your personal repo and then you don't have to take the load of continuously updating them.",
