   "body" : "Adds an `updatepeer` RPC to update peer config and carry out actions on the peer by NodeId. At the moment, the actions are just changing whether the peer is whitelisted and whether the peer is a manual_connection (previously called an addnode). Future possible actions would be changing banscore, banning, and so on.\r\n\r\nThis is designed to be called using named arguments, but due to the RPC infrastructure can also be called with positional arguments (although doing so would be very fiddly).\r\n\r\nI've set the category to hidden for now. We may want to make the whitelisting behaviour more granular in future and I don't want to commit us to a public API that we can't then change.",
