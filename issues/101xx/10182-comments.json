When switching to std::thread and std::condition_variable, we have to handle that manually instead. That's a good thing though, less magic going on behind the scenes!\r\n\r\nSo init.cpp will need to learn how to stop the workers and the handler gracefully before making the switch. The order is important as well: worker threads may have callbacks into objects that have been destructed at exit, so they should be interrupted early in the shutdown process.",
