Seems like the is an interest for an RPC client with \"like tab completion, and inline help, and batch processing, and pipelines of queries, etc\"\n\nMy biased vote goes toward building it with Python, because there are plenty of existing libs for that. Would the script in contrib/bitrpc/ be a good start?\n\nOther questions involve feature set, and how to manage the executable. I've leave those for discussion though.  \n",
