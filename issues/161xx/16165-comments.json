      "body" : "Concept ACK. Love this design direction which makes things more modular and gets rid of inheritance hell.\r\n\r\nI have a few questions. From the proposal:\r\n> At the end of this refactoring, the stack will be:\r\n> SigningProvider -> CBasicKeyStore (renamed) -> CWallet\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n> CWallet will need to be standalone\r\n> there is no need for CWallet to be a SigningProvider\r\n\r\nSo if CWallet \"is-NOT-a\" SigningProvider, then why have it as part of the inheritance tree at all? \r\n\r\nTaking it further, could we maybe get rid of this inheritance tree altogether by either (a) merging CBasicKeyStore into SigningProvider, just like what @achow101 is proposing for CKeyStore? or (b) converting it to a \"has-a\" relationship? So a SigningProvider could have a CBasicKeyStore to help manage its own keys. But a CBasicKeyStore is-NOT-a SigningProvider (which makes more sense to me, it's not intuitive that a KeyStore is also a SigningProvider).\r\n\r\n(a) makes more sense if a KeyStore always has to be a part of a SigningProvider (and nowhere else). (b) makes more sense if a stand-alone KeyStore could be a useful thing, without the ability to sign.\r\n\r\nIn general, I think most of the class relationships modeled here sound like classic has-a, not is-a relationships.\r\n\r\n",
