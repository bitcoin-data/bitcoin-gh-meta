Currently, each CChainState instance has its own mapBlockIndex, a collection of linked block headers, in addition to a few other data structures that are related to maintenance of the block tree but not necessarily to any given chainstate.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid duplicating this data across chainstates, this change moves chainstate-agnostic block metadata (and related behavior) into a class, `BlockManager`. Chainstates are parameterized with a reference to a blockmanager instance and in practice they share the same instance.\r\n\r\nMost of this change is conceptually move-only, though the diff is somewhat muddled. The first commit can be reviewed slightly more easily with `--color-moved=dimmed_zebra`. Admittedly, that commit is pretty unwieldy; I tried to split it up after the fact with `git add --patch`, but that was difficult because of git's inability to split hunks past a certain point. Some of the moves also ended up being obscured when done over separate commits.",
