So let's make sure this actually works as advertised.\r\n\r\nFrom the Apple Doc, it's important to note that this does not impact \"forced sleep\":\r\n\r\n> Forced sleep occurs when the user takes some sort of direct action to cause the machine to sleep. Closing the lid on a laptop or selecting sleep from the Apple menu both cause forced sleep. The system will also induce forced sleep under certain conditions, for example, a thermal emergency or a low battery.\r\nIdle sleep occurs when the machine is unused for a specific period of time configured in the Energy Saver System Preferences.\r\n\r\nSome hints for testing:\r\n\r\n* use `pmset -g` and `pmgset -g log` ([background info](https://eclecticlight.co/2017/01/20/power-management-in-detail-using-pmset/))\r\n* keep an eye on `(sleep prevented by sharingd)`, you may want to turn off BlueTooth (and ActivityMontor?)\r\n* the network tab can be deceptive, the log file shows gaps more clearly\r\n* `disksleep` (e.g. 10 minutes) is probably the most relevant setting\r\n* I'm not sure how `tcpkeepalive` (e.g. 1 minute) plays into things, IBD usually isn't idle that long\r\n* you can configure a hot corner to turn your display off\r\n\r\nI tested in battery mode and set `disksleep` to 1 minute. I started QT without the PR and let it sync a little bit on a fresh datadir. I moved the app as well as the log Console to the background. I then used the hot corner to turn off the display, and waited 5 minutes. This results in a 4 minute gap in the log, as expected.\r\n\r\nIn other other attempts there was no gap, so maybe it was because I didn't have QT / Console in the background, or something else on my system was interfering.\r\n\r\nI then ran with this PR. I don't see a \"sleep prevented by\" entry in `pmset -g`, but that's perhaps expected. I again turned off the display, and there was a gap.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the hot corner counts as \"forced sleep\". But if I just let the screen go idle, I also get a gap in the log.\r\n\r\nNotably I don't see \"Downloading blockchain\" or even \"bitcoin-qt\" in the `pmset -g log` log.",

Ideally it would be on another layer (Qt or even better app config level / plist). I have hope that there is a flag on the configuration layer that tells the OS \"this app runs in background and doesn't like to be set to sleep\" (like a webserver).\r\n\r\nOn top, once Core is in sync, users may expect that it goes to \"sleep\" when requested.",
