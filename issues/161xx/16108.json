   "body" : "Running bitcoind and bitcoin-cli with JSON RPC, 0.18.0 on testnet.\r\nI still have some issue with SubtractFeeFromAmount. It makes no sense at all, though. Stay with me on this for a moment , please:\r\n\r\nBalance: 0.00008000\r\nReceived: 0.00118410\r\nBalance: 0.00126410\r\nSent: 0.00118292\r\nBalance: 0.00008000\r\nSent: 0.00001000\r\nBalance: 0.00007000\r\nReceived: 0.00118410\r\n**Balance: 0.00125410\r\nThen to make sure it was nothing about PHP or jsonRPC, I use bitcoin-cli directly:\r\nbitcoin-cli sendtoaddress n3qpExEQbF8orkqY7cpmJu6iUhNVHHcnk3 0.00118292 \"\" \"\" true\r\n50458050f042460ea7199a0d0327edbae153e4e0083cc5862ab64322b31819e9\r\nBalance: 0.00007000 (!)**\r\n\r\nHow is it possible? Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work? For a long time I thought I had written the parameters wrong for json-RPC, but unless the above command is also wrong, it's not me?\r\nAll of the above was of course performed with subtractfeefromamount true.\r\nBasically all config values are default or unset, no specific txfees or anything like that.\r\n\r\nThank you so much in advance for any help with this as it's had me stumped for days now.\r\nI made a new issue for clarity (different actual issue) and because I don't know if closed are ever reviewed again.",
