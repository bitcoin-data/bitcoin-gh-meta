Thus the removals are real.\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus this change means less work for the preprocessor/compiler. At least 51 393 lines of code no longer needs to be processed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git diff -u HEAD~1 | grep -E '^\\-#include ' | cut -f2 -d\"<\" | cut -f1 -d\">\" | \\\r\n      sed 's%^%src/%g' | xargs cat | wc -l\r\n51393\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that 51 393 is the lower bound: the real number is likely much higher when taking into account transitively included headers :-)",
