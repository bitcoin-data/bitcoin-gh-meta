   "body" : "BIP 37 bloom filters have been well-known to be a significant DoS\r\ntarget for some time. However, in order to provide continuity for\r\nSPV clients relying on it, the NODE_BLOOM service flag was added,\r\nand left as a default, to ensure sufficient nodes exist with such a\r\nflag.\r\n\r\nNODE_BLOOM is, at this point, well-established and, as long as\r\nthere exist 0.18 nodes with default config (which I'd anticipate\r\nwill be true for many years), will be available from some peers. By\r\nthat time, the continued slowdown of BIP 37-based filtering will\r\nlikely have rendered it useless (though this is already largely the\r\ncase). Further, BIP 37 was deliberately never updated to support\r\nwitness-based filtering as newer wallets are expected to migrate to\r\nsome yet-to-be-network-exposed filters.",
