Another user I know always gets an address starting with a \"1\".\r\n\r\n![getnewaddress-screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4021240/59165441-7444b000-8ad0-11e9-892d-6e6ccc66a6c9.png)\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\nThis is reproducible both from command line running bitcoind, and also bitcoin-Qt. From bitcoind, I type:\r\n\r\nbitcoin-cli getnewaddress legacy\r\n\r\nOr from bitcoin-Qt I issue the commands from the debug window console, as shown in the screenshot above.\r\n \r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nRunning version 0.18 downloaded from https://bitcoin.org/en/download\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nI'm running on macOS Mojave Version 10.14.5, and I always get an address starting with \"3\".\r\nThe other user I know runs Ubuntu, and always gets an address starting with a \"1\".\r\n\r\n<!-- For the GUI-related issue on Linux provide names and versions of a distro, a desktop environment and a graphical shell (if relevant). -->\r\nN//a\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n",
