Trying to narrow down when I do a getaddressinfo on them I saw ischange = true and that seems to be the issue is some of the addresses have been marked as change somehow; note these were made with getnewaddress and/or addwitnessaddress so are not change addresses. Doing a \"setlabel address ''\" removes the flag and fixes it but we can't go through millions of addresses with getaddressinfo :)",
