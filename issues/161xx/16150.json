Therefore, the rest of the deps must not be linked in, or are headers-only.\r\n> \r\n> Results of my investigation (please verify these as I might be completely wrong):\r\n> ### libXext\r\n> \r\n> The only package that we declare as depending on libXext is qt, and it doesn't actually... Tested by removing the package definition and references to it, everything seems to compile fine.\r\n> ### xtrans\r\n> \r\n> It seems that xtrans is just code+headers and not a library that needs to be linked in. We can verify this by looking at the build outputs.\r\n> \r\n> Its configure is very confused as to why we supply it with `--disable-{static,shared}`. It is, however, required as a build-time dependency for libX11.\r\n> ### dbus\r\n> \r\n> The only reference to dbus is in the configure options for qt: `-dbus-runtime`. Which indicates to qt to dynamically open libdbus-1 at runtime (with dlopen?). I believe this means that we don't actually use the dbus we build. (This one I'm the least sure about)",
