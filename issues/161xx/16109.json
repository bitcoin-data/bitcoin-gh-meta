   "body" : "# Describe the issue\r\n\r\n`gitian-build.py --setup` doesn't install `curl`, which is required by `make download` (which is run by `gitian-build.py --build`).  Since some OS's like Debian Buster don't have `curl` installed by default, this causes a build error.\r\n\r\n# What behavior did you expect?\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core should build without errors in Gitian.\r\n\r\n# What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)?\r\n\r\nThe following error shows up while trying to fetch Boost:\r\n\r\n`/bin/sh: 1: curl: not found`\r\n\r\n# How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so?\r\n\r\n1. Install a fresh Debian Buster VM with KDE.\r\n2. Clone Bitcoin Core.\r\n3. `../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-build.py --commit --setup JeremyRand master`\r\n4. `../bitcoin/contrib/gitian-build.py --commit --build JeremyRand master`\r\n\r\n# What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)?\r\n\r\n72634244580dc2e3c630ee27e47587080d064b68 , self-compiled.\r\n\r\n# What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)?\r\n\r\nDebian Buster VM inside Qubes OS; Haswell i7, HDD.\r\n\r\n# Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process.\r\n\r\nIt looks like adding `'curl'` to the `programs` list in `gitian-build.py`'s `setup` function would be sufficient to solve the problem.  `'wget'` is already there.",
