   "body" : "There are a couple common refactoring changes in both Taproot and CTV that I think can be merged as is, as well as a code organization change that just CTV needs that otherwise interferes. Other than that the two PRs should largely be conflict free (except for caching, which is a trivial fix).\r\n\r\nBoth CTV and Taproot have 6eb32bc in common, so I think it could be merged standalone.\r\n\r\nIt might also make sense to have breakout commits for 6236e74 which just moves the field hashers to primitive/transaction.h so that the function GetStandardTemplateHash can be exposed from primitive/transaction.h for easier integration in other parts of the codebase.\r\n\r\nc772944 is a change that both CTV and Taproot make, but I think we picked slightly different styles/names for these things. Maybe we can agree on unified names and then commit them. I chose to rename them because I didn't want it to be possible to confuse them for the prior API which returned the double hash. I think this change should stay (it wouldn't be a problem for me to un-rename though if you don't want to rebase), but I don't have feelings on Rehash vs SHA256Uint256. This will make both implementations smaller to review. \r\n\r\nThese are just non-functional refactors so they are fine to go in, even if neither Taproot or CTV were to go in at all.",
