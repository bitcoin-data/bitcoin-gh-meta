   "body" : "These are a couple common refactoring changes in both Taproot and CTV that I think can be merged as is. Other than that the two PRs should largely be conflict free (except for caching, which is a relatively trivial fix).\r\n\r\nThese essentially just allow us to get access to the single SHA256 version of Get{Prevouts,Sequence,Outputs} hash which are used both in the Taproot and CTV spec. They use the single hash versions because they are cheaper to compute, which reduces validation overhead. These refactors are non-functional, and just expose the ability to get the single hash when needed.\r\n\r\nThe names of Get\\*Hash are renamed to Get\\*SHA256 to avoid confusion with the value returned previously.",
