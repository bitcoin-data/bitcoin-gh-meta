   "body" : "Add a check to the CI that checks whether the repository has any git submodules (either directly or of subtrees) and rejects it if so.\r\n\r\nIn #17398 I accidentally almost added three submodules because they are part of the `crc32c` third-party repository, which was subtree'd there. This was only avoided because the gitian build failed.\r\n\r\nWe do not make use of submodules so there doesn't need to be any exception.\r\n\r\n#### Useful skills:\r\n\r\n- Shell scripting\r\n\r\n#### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this. You are encouraged to comment on the issue if you are planning to work on it. This will help other contributors monitor which issues are actively being addressed and is also an effective way to request assistance if and when you need it.\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",
