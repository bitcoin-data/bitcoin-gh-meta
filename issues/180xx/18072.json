   "body" : "~~Based on #16392~~ **Update:** Base PR has been merged.\r\n\r\nWhy this is useful: Previously, we were using [the `libc++` headers copied from the clang package we downloaded from llvm.org](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18072/commits/8e888983b7ced7a53d21272085a74558b20d7821). This is suboptimal as our goal is to have a toolchain that can target macOS, which (in Xcode.app) has its own set of `libc++` headers that can [differ from those of the clang package](https://gist.github.com/fanquake/9315a02416f56d1545dfef7f9c75bc45). It seems to me that given our goal, it is better to use what Apple intends, and not rely on upstream `clang` <-> Apple `clang` compatibility.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis requires a regeneration of the macOS SDK, I apologize that this didn't make it into #16392, please follow the updated instructions here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18072/commits/8e8fadff59c48b33ffbdac14acd52f469954307d?short_path=9de36be#diff-9de36befe13356841c2699ee0eff4a0a (I'm linking to the Markdown diff so that people who need to regenerate the macOS SDK can see the difference in procedure from before)",
