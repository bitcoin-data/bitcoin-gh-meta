After entering the passphrase, it deflates/decrypts metadata, keypools, descriptors into memory only.\r\n* A password re-entry when spends happen could still be made (eventually with the short inmemory timespan KDF-ed key)\r\n* Enter the passphrase more often (at startup / load-time of a wallet plus additional timeout) prevents from lost funds through lost passphrase.",

Most wallets I know of also currently do this so would be more familiar to new users / easier to onboard them. \r\n\r\nAnother suggestion could be a reminder the to re-enter their password using spaced repetition to prevent uses forgetting / miss placing their password - [signal private messenger](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059792-Signal-PIN) does this well. \r\n\r\n> Signal includes a built-in reminder feature that uses spaced repetition. To help you memorize your PIN, Signal will periodically ask you to confirm it. These reminders occur at the following intervals after the feature is first enabled:\r\n>    12 Hours\r\n>     1 Day\r\n>     3 Days\r\n>     7 Days\r\n>     14 Days \r\n\r\nCC @GBKS @johnsBeharry",

Wonder if that's easily possible as each OS might go about this differently, but I think this would be great to have as people probably already rely on these system utilities.\r\n\r\nEncrypting all personal/local data seems logical.\r\n\r\nThe spaced repetition reminder is interesting.
