   "body" : "Since installing 0.19.0.1, i had issues while syncing coins.\r\n\r\nThis happens when Core is behind some days or blocks, if it is running all the time, it's OK.\r\n\r\n0.19.0.1 64 bit\r\nWin 10 64 bit home\r\nASUS VivoBook S15 S510UQ\r\nCore chain runs on external HDD Maxtor 2TB on usb 3 (connection working up to 100 mb/sec)\r\nCore installed on 256 GB SSD Sandisk - up to 300-400 mb/sec\r\n\r\nWhile sync, HDD active time goes to 100% and transfer at about 1-3 mb/sec so hdd transfer speed over usb3 is NOT the issue.\r\n\r\nDuring the sync, program goes to \"Not responding\" for around 15-20 seconds, if left as it is then it resumes properly and will eventually finish and working fine. **However an inexperienced user might get scared, close core and in that case I think that his coins would get compromised due to repeated syncing attempts (I am not 100% sure about that though)**\r\n\r\nIssue confirmed by other users here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5215754.0\r\n\r\nChecked core logs and didn't find anything pointing to this odd behaviour.\r\n\r\nthanks",
