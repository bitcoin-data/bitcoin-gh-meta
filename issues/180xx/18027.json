   "body" : "Add a \"PSBT Operations\" dialog, reached from the \"Load PSBT...\" menu item, giving options to sign or broadcast the loaded PSBT as appropriate, as well as copying the result to the clipboard or saving it to a file.\r\n\r\nThis is based on Sjors' #17509, and depends on that PR going in first. (It effectively replaces the small \"load PSBT\" dialog from that PR with a more feature-rich one.)\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n* The way I display status information is maybe unusual (a status bar, rather than messageboxes.) I think it's helpful to have the information in it be persistent rather than transitory. But if people dislike it, I would probably move the \"current state of the transaction\" info to the top line of the main label, and the \"what action just happened, and did it succeed\" info into a messagebox.\r\n* I don't really know much about the translation/localization stuff. I put tr() in all the places it seemed like it ought to go. I did not attempt to translate the result of TransactionErrorString (which is shared by GUI and non-GUI code); I don't know if that's correct, but it matches the \"error messages in logs should be googleable in English\" heuristic. I don't know whether there are things I should be doing to reduce translator effort (like minimizing the total number of distinct message strings I use, or something.)\r\n* I don't really know how (if?) automated testing is applied to GUI code. I can make a list of PSBTs exercising all the codepaths for manual testing, if that's the right approach. Input appreciated.\r\n\r\n",
