Currently, this RPC is scanning the full UTXO set every time it is called which makes it hard to use for users that [want to continually check the coin supply](https://blog.bitmex.com/forkmonitor-unexpected-inflation-detection-and-warning-system/) or compare UTXO set hashes between different nodes. It is especially challenging in periods of multiple quickly mined blocks, even relatively fast machines.\r\n\r\nImplementation overview:\r\n- The current serialization of the UTXO set for the purpose of hashing is changed based on sipa's concept in proposed on the [mailing list in 2017](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-May/014337.html) and #10434\r\n- The hashing algorithm in for the UTXO set is changed to Muhash, which was also implemented by sipa\r\n- CoinStatsIndex is added which keeps an index of all values that would require `gettxoutsetinfo` to scan the UTXO set\r\n- CoinStatsIndex can be activated through the flag `-coinstatsindex`\r\n\r\nTodos/Open questions:\r\n- The transactions count is currently not implemented as it seems not knowable ex-post without running a full IBD to build up the index. I am looking for a solution to this. Ideas are:\r\n  - Require `txindex` and the transactions count from it\r\n  - Remove transactions count or mark it as unreliable in a different way if coinstatsindex is enabled\r\n- The transactions count question is also interesting because it seems to be the only obstacle to providing access to historical coin statistics, which may be a nice follow-up feature if transaction counts can be ignored somehow\r\n- More benchmarking to evaluate potential switch from Muhash to [ECMH](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/477) as the hashing algorithm\r\n- IBD benchmarking with the index enabled\r\n- Tests could be improved\r\n\r\nThis is an extension to my [rolling UTXO set hash proposal](https://gist.github.com/fjahr/fa4892874b090d3a4f4fccc5bafa0210) from last year.\r\n\r\nEdit: 3c5c1ca should probably be squashed into the prior commits but I wanted to leave sipa's commits unchanged for the start.",
