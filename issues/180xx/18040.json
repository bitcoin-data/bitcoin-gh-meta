   "body" : "Moving the discussion from #17975 here as adding Miniscript support to the TestFramework is only a subset of broader Miniscript integration in Core and shouldn't disrupt review of that PR.\r\n\r\n1. Does Bitcoin Core need to be able to recognize Miniscript in the future? Are the future upsides sufficiently material to introduce it? Presumably Miniscript could always be translated to Script externally to Core at little cost?\r\n\r\nTentatively, there seems to be strong benefits to Core being able to recognize and analyze Miniscript such as the Core wallet being able to [creating a valid witness for Miniscript](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-September/002138.html).\r\n\r\n2. Is this a stepping stone towards greater support for Miniscript (and possibly a policy language too) in Core? What impact does this have on the use and ongoing development of external libraries like the Rust Miniscript library?\r\n\r\nTentatively, I would guess external Miniscript libraries like [rust-miniscript](https://github.com/apoelstra/rust-miniscript) will have more Miniscript capability/features than will be introduced to Core. The [C++ implementation}(https://github.com/sipa/miniscript) is \"Core compatible\". I'm assuming the plan is that this will broadly slot into Core (assuming there is consensus, sufficient review) given the open PR #16800. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Some of this may be obvious to some (apologies if so!) but at the very least this will be educational for people like me who are curious about what should be in Core and what should be left for external Miniscript libraries. \r\n",
