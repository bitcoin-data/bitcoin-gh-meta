I didn't catch that initially.\r\n\r\nThe fix is:\r\n```\r\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/local/Frameworks /usr/local/sbin\r\nsudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/Frameworks /usr/local/sbin\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like anyone who has never installed some of the dependencies before will run into this hiccup. Would it be worth to preemptively ask everyone to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo mkdir ...\r\nsudo chown ...\r\nbrew install ...\r\n```\r\n?",
