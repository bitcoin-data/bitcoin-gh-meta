   "body" : "Refactors UpdateForDescendants to use Epochs instead of sets to de-duplicate traversal, and replaces the cache entries with a vector instead of a set. This is a straightforward win. The algorithm is a bit clever so as not to require two separate vectors for txiters that need expanding and txiters that have already been processed, but I think it's relatively easy to reason about.\r\n\r\nextracted from #18063 as a standalone because it turns out the DoS issues with this code perhaps merit more extensive review http://gnusha.org/bitcoin-core-dev/2020-02-11.log. That PR will stay open for review, but this PR is designed as an \"obviously better\" win that can be merged now to keep progress up on the mempool project.",
