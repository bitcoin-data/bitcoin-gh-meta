These can be removed when the issues have been resolved upstreams :)\r\n\r\nNote to reviewers: The `%c` and `%*` issues are also present for `%<some junk>c` and `%<some junk>*`. That is why simply matching on `\"%c\"` or `\"%*\"` is not enough. Note that the intentionally trivial skipping logic overshoots somewhat (`c[â¦]%` is filtered in addition to `%[â¦]c`).",
