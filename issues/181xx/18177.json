Please describe.**\r\nWhen trying to estimate the fee I should pay in a congested mempool, I have frequently found Mempool Visualizers to be useful. Currently, Bitcoin Core allows you to track the size of the Mempool, but not the distribution of fees over time. There are many useful open-source Visualizers that could be integrated into Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nTwo projects with clean and simple displays are Johoe's Mempool statistics (my personal favourite) and Mempool space. Both of these are open-source\r\nhttps://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,24h\r\nhttps://mempool.space/graphs\r\nhttps://github.com/jhoenicke/mempool\r\nhttps://github.com/mempool-space/mempool.space\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI am not aware of good reasons why a feature like this wouldn't be included. For e.g. is it resource intensive to track the fee distribution of the mempool by time? I am not a developer but if it is an easy integration and someone can help me, I'm willing to take a stab at it, or at least assist to the degree I can.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis is a pony :horse:\r\n",
