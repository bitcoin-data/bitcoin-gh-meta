If 10% of our public node users are exposing their RPC port we're doing something wrong :)\r\n\r\nThis is something I've been worried about for quite a while (recent examples: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17156#issuecomment-579364107 + https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17742#issuecomment-565632396 + correspondence with `security@` when reporting various RPC issues (incl. pre-auth)).\r\n\r\nGood to finally have this quantified: that helps getting the appropriate level of attention to the issue :)\r\n\r\nMay I ask what data source you used to arrive at that the 10% figure? It would be nice to have a public reference to point to in RPC security discussions.\r\n\r\nAlso, if anyone has aggregated [`zmap`](https://github.com/zmap/zmap) or [`masscan`](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan) results for portscans for a.) port 8333 vs. b.) port 8332 (RPC port) would be very interesting too.\r\n\r\n",
