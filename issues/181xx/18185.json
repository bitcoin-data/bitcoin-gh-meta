   "body" : "Regarding that Bitcoin Core switched to bech32 as the default format for addresses recently (with release 0.19.0.1), this should also be reflected in the RPC help texts. The change was already done for the RPCs `getaddressinfo` (commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/2ee0cb3330ccf70f0540cb42370796e32eff1569 by jonatack, PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17283) and `validateaddress` (commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18122/commits/7f1475c7119e8c72bce39a63386a6ca859066b80 by my humble self, PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18122/), but there are still some RPCExamples around with Base58 addresses, i.e. \r\n- `setlabel`\r\n- `sendtoaddress`\r\n- `getreceivedbyaddress`\r\n- .....\r\n\r\nAll those legacy address usages should be identified and substituted by bech32 addresses where it makes sense (note that e.g. for `signmessage` and `verifymessage` there is as far as I know no possibility to sign with segwit addresses yet, hence the legacy addresses should stay). For the address, the newly introduced string constant `EXAMPLE_ADDRESS` (in `src/rpc/util.h`) can be used, which contains an illegal bech32 address.\r\n\r\n#### Useful skills:\r\n\r\nBasic understanding of address formats.\r\n\r\n#### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this. You are encouraged to comment on the issue if you are planning to work on it. This will help other contributors monitor which issues are actively being addressed and is also an effective way to request assistance if and when you need it.\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",
