   "body" : "In many places, our code assumes that presence in the address book indicates a non-change key, and absence of an entry in mapAddressBook indicates change.\r\n\r\nThis no longer holds true after #13756 (first released in 0.19) since it added a \"used\" DestData populated even for change addresses. Only avoid-reuse wallets should be affected by this issue.\r\n\r\nThankfully, populating DestData does not write a label to the database, so we can retroactively fix this (so long as the user didn't see the change address and manually assign it a real label).\r\n\r\nFixing it is accomplished by:\r\n\r\n* Adding a new bool to CAddressBookData to track if the label has ever been assigned, either by loading one from the database, or by assigning one at runtime.\r\n* `CAddressBookData::IsChange` and `CWallet::FindAddressBookEntry` are new methods to assist in excluding change from code that doesn't expect to see them.\r\n* For safety in merging, `CAddressBookData::name` has been made read-only (the actual data is stored in `m_label`, a new private member, and can be changed only with `setLabel` which updates the `m_change` flag), and `mapAddressBook` has been renamed to `m_address_book` (to force old code to be rebased to compile).\r\n\r\nA final commit also does some minor optimisation, avoiding redundant lookups in `m_address_book` when we already have a pointer to the `CAddressBookData`.",
