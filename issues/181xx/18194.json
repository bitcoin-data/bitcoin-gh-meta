Probably some should remain with the old address (eg, whether the associated key was used to spend already), and others should be moved to the new address (no existing cases, just hypothetically). I doubt we should ever just outright delete it.\r\n\r\nEdit: **Bug 3** (unconfirmed, debatable): Editing both the label and address in the label-editing dialog would still delete the label for the old address.\r\n\r\n**Proposed resolution**: Remove the ability to edit the address field. It doesn't really make sense.\r\n",
