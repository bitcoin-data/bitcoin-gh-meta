Perhaps this is overkill, and if reviewers feel so, I'd be happy to change it to a more ad-hoc approach of just keeping separate serializers/deserializers for that aspect - but I do like the resulting `Using<VectorFormatter<CompactSizeFormatter, DifferentialSerTransform, DifferentialUnserTransform>>(obj.indexes)` unified code (i.e. \"serialize `obj.indexes` as a vector of CompactSize-encoded integers, each transformed using Differential(Unser/Ser)Transform\").",
