   "body" : "According to public internet scan data, approximately 10% of Bitcoin nodes listening on 8333 also have their RPC port misconfigured to listen on `0.0.0.0`. There is no way that this can be used safely which does not involve plaintext credentials being transmitted across the internet, especially since the complete removal of `rpcssl`. If this is desirable, proxying the socket through `nginx` with SSL is a viable alternative that does not require listening publically. \r\n\r\nThe `rpcbind` option should either be restricted to allow for only single definitions of a host, or removed entirely to only permit binding to `localhost` for the management interface.
