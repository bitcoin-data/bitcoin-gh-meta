I was saying that the mempool acceptance code just ensures that ancestor inputs cannot be replaced and why does a function need to then check for them, I can't see how a pinning attack has anything to do with ancestors rather than just the child in question...",

It's not checking whether the ancestors would signal/be replaced.\r\n\r\n\r\n> If someone can clarify how its an attack (like it wont get mined because its on the tx fee limit?), carve out still ensure LN works, what sorts of things would not be available to someone?\r\n\r\nThis is not related to a pinning attack.\r\n\r\nClosing now, hopefully this answers your question. We've added a doc/policy/mempool_replacements.md and more documentation since then if you have more questions about RBF.",
