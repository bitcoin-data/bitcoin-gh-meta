   "body" : "Type punning in C++ is not like C. As per the C++ standard, one cannot use unions to convert the bit type. A discussion about this can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25664848/unions-and-type-punning). In C++, a union is supposed to only hold one type at a time. It's intended to be used only as `std::variant`. Switching types is undefined behavior.\r\n\r\nIn fact, C++20 has a special casting function, called [`bit_cast`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/bit_cast) that solved this problem.\r\n\r\nWhy has it been working so far? Because some compilers tolerate using unions and switching types, like gcc. More information [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Type-punning).\r\n\r\nOne important thing to mention is that performance is generally not affected by that memcpy. Compilers are smart enough to convert that to a memory cast when possible. But we have to do it the right way, otherwise, it's jut undefined behavior that depends on the compiler.",
