Any particular attacker trying to bypass ASLR faces a problem whose difficulty is dependent on that attacker's knowledge, and not on other attackers' knowledge. The statement is not dependent on no attackers knowing \"where anything useful is located\", and so it is imprecise to lump all attackers together, or all attackers' knowledge together. I realise that a reader could nevertheless interpret the plural statement as intended, but it can also be misinterpreted in a way that the singular/generic \"An attacker...\" statement can't.\r\n\r\n(Also, \"grammatically plural\" is an imprecise concept.
