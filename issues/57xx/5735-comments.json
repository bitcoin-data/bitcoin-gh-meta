It prints the log messages to stdout, so it is trivial to make the output - per line - end up in a system log. Some init service management systems will even do that by default.\r\n\r\nThis is another example of something that has been done and forgotten 1000's of times, since the 80's, no need to spend time building, reviewing or testing any additional log-fu in bitcoind. You can do logging, externally, any way you want, bitcoind just has to provide the messages. Which it does.\r\n\r\nBTW: I'd think it is  much easier to correlate multiple instances in different locales if times are in UTC, not local time. If you then want to find out what happened at a certain time of the day you'd convert that time into UTC once and look up that timestamp in all the other logs. If all logs are in their local times, that's a lot more involved.\r\n\r\n@ianks Agreed.\r\n ",
