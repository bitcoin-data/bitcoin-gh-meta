What appears to happen is that in 40e96a3 it puts the character in a local buffer on the stack, whereas in 14d023f it uses the address of the constant. This makes sense as it passes a reference (pointer).\r\n\r\nIn any case, I did a verification in which I replaced the constants with #defines, and that one matched.\r\n\r\nI also did rudimentary testing to make sure this doesn't result in a different on-disk format.
