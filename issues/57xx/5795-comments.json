Forking in terms of your node rejecting something\nit shouldn't or accepting something it shouldn't thereby ending up with a\ndifferent view from how the rest of the network sees things.  Not in terms\nof process management.\n\nThere was a recent issue where OpenSSL tightened up their rules for what\nconstitutes a valid signature encoding.  Nodes that were built static were\nunaffected, but nodes that had bitcoinds that were linked against an\nautomatically updated system OpenSSL started rejecting blocks that most of\nthe network saw as valid.\n\nStatic linking and dependency control are really just better for this\ndistributed consensus type of stuff.\n\nOn Sat, Feb 28, 2015 at 4:07 PM, error10 <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> I'm running make depends now, but it'll be a while before that finishes.\n>\n> In the meantime,... does that mean that it's possible for the test suite\n> to pass and still end up with a forking issue?\n>\n> Ã¢ÂÂ\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/5795#issuecomment-76546103>.\n>\n",
