Their \"peopleness\" can be determined in a contract specific and ad hoc way to make sybils costly, like just requiring people sign in to the organising website with a reasonable looking Facebook profile or something.\r\n2. Those 50 people each select an address for themselves to receive the funds.\r\n3. Now the contract goes to crowdfunding. Say 400 people contribute money. The contract is funded.\r\n4. Once the contract completes, each node operator receives a subkey of a group public key from the organiser of the contract. The group pubkey is published.\r\n5. We extend the P2P protocol to allow optional signing challenges. The node operators provide their specific private key to bitcoind and a new message is added like \"group?\" which just contains a nonce. The server then signs the nonce with their private key and the resulting signature proves only that the server is a member of the group that was funded, but not which one.\r\n\r\nThus, there is no correlation between the Bitcoin address used to raise the money and the IP address of the new node, but it's still proven that the node was funded by the contract.\r\n\r\nObviously bitcoind would need some fairly complex new code for this, and responding to the challenges would have to be CPU prioritised lower than actually handling network traffic etc. There are DoS issues to think through. But I think it would satisfy the constraints and avoid a centralised third party who holds the bitcoins for distribution because the contract would pay the node operators directly. The central authority just checks for sybils and admits people into the scheme.\r\n\r\nThe main downside is of course complexity. I think realistically such a scheme would have to be a feature of Lighthouse itself. The project file format could be extended to indicate that this is a node-support contract, and then the app could just perform some IP group signature challenges from time to time when it's started and inform the user if a node is unable to respond to the challenge i.e. someone is in violation of the (legal/social) contract.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine several extensions of the scheme. For instance instead of paying node operators up front, the contract pays to multisig outputs that are controlled by a dispute mediator who measures uptime, performance and protocol compliance of the nodes.",

With the exception of Lighthouse and similar concepts which I think will gain broader acceptance as time goes on.  I hope that perhaps this new discussion might find a way to get giving, or microdonation ideas better integrated into bitcoin.  \r\n\r\nCentral to this discussion is the question, should a bitcoin address be tied directly to a node?  I think that development effort should move more away from doing that.
