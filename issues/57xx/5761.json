   "body" : "I open this issue to have a space for discussions and a status of current work going on.\n\nThere are plans to mostly rewrite the current wallet implementation and â speaking long term âÂ completely decouple the wallet from bitcoin-core and move it to a separate repository. This might lower down the amount of pull requests and issues, etc. in the bitcoin-core repository.\n### Planed transition/features:\n- Decouple wallet from bitcoin core, remove wallets `#ifdef ENABLE_WALLET` and implement a startup command to run bitcoin core with a/the new wallet or the legacy wallet (`-addmodule=wallet` or `-addmodule=legacywallet`, or `-addmodule=wallet,internalminer`) #5752, #5758, #5744\n- Keep the legacywallet as untouched as possible\n- Add a new BDB free wallet with a internal append only data format (logdb) (this could also be the starting point of a new wallet module). Support a migration tool.  #5686\n- Remove accounting system (new wallet only) or transform it into labels #3816\n- Add support for Bip32/HDWallets\n- Add SPV mode\n- Add multiwallet support\n### Status\n- Currently the legacywallet decoupling is the main focus. See #5752, #5758, #5744, #5745\n- The planed internal append only file format has been proven to work in #5686\n- HTTP/RPC Server: #5677 (which is related somehow)\n### Related Discussions\n#3882 Split off wallet to seperate repository\n#3440 Post-0.9 modularization\n\n---\n\nIf someone is interested in contributing, it would mainly help to **review and test the PRs listed above**. Of course delivering implementation would also be great, just make sure to speak up in a comment and make others aware of what your are working on.\n\nAs usual, the bottleneck will be testing and reviewing. Especially the unspectacular changes which not directly lead to a feature like bip32 or spv at first sight.\n\nConceptional ideas are also very much welcomed.\n",
