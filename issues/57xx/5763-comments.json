This surely doesnÃ¢ÂÂt belong to RPC. Private key is cryptographic material!!!\n\nPlease close this issue.",

A better place for it would be in a library, and indeed there are various such libraries available for different programming languages (e.g. bitcoin-pythonlib for python). There is no advantage (and insecurity through potential interception) to using RPC, and also bottleneck issues.\r\n",
