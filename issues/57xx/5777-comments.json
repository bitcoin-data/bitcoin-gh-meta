If it's an issue then I'll go in and try to undo it but since I apparently can't rebase to the current version without utterly breaking the PR, I'll have to do it by hand.\n\nIn regards to your question, sorry that you didn't get a reply, I didn't see the question before. My understanding, such as it is, is that this change will only affect the about window, not the help window.\n",
