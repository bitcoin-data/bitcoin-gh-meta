      "body" : "I cant follow you. This pr rather introduces the bugs.\r\n\r\nThe first use case shows a 226 byte transaction with \"pay only the minimum fee\" selected.\r\n- \"Before\" is 226 satoshis, which is correct, its the minimum fee\r\n- \"After\" shows 1000 satoshis, which is wrong, its not the minimum fee and its not \"per kilobyte\" (as shown in the radio button) but rather\r\n  this is \"total at least\". But the minimum fee is not \"total at least\". The minimum fee is \"per kilobyte\".\r\n\r\nThe second use case shows a 1114 bytes transaction. The difference is only the \"~\" sign in front of the fee.\r\n- \"Before\" has the \"~\" which is correct\r\n- \"After\" doesnt which is wrong\r\n\r\nCoin control guesses the transaction size and with that, it also guesses the fee. So we need a \"~\" in front of the fee. However, there is one use case, where we dont show the \"~\". This is if you select \"total at least\" and the transaction is < 1000 bytes. Because in that case you just pay what you entered. But if the transaction is > 1000 bytes, both radio buttons pay per kilobyte. Read the tooltip of \"total at least\". So if > 1000 bytes we always need a \"~\", but your screenshot doesnt show a \"~\".\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I worry about, is that if even we developers got confused by this, then its probably not clear enough. I thought the tooltips would be enough explanation for a sophisticated users. Suggestions welcome.",

It's also behind a \"expert\" opt in setting so it should be clear to everyone that it may need some seconds to fully understand CoinControl.\r\n\r\nPersonally I would get confused because of the recent added double-tilde in front of the aprox. values. But I also understand the concerns of difficult distinction between tilde and dash.\r\n\r\nPR: NACK",
