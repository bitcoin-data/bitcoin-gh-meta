The results are not at all obvious.. \"run bitcoin-qt now\" from the installer runs as the admin user. After that, running the .exe from program files (no shortcuts are installed for the current user) prompts for a data path. Probably exactly what you saw when running the official setup.exe as Administrator.\n\nIt appears as though non-trivial changes to the installer would be needed.\n\nIt's been quite a while since I've used a Windows environment, do most applications fare well in this scenario?\n",

The easiest \"fix\" IMO would be to always request elevation and remove the \"run bitcoin-qt now screen\".\n\nIdeally the installer should only request elevation if it actually needs it. For example, if I install to \"C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\" it will need to elevate, but if I install to \"C:\\Users\\PRabahy\\Bitcoin\", it doesn't. If the installer has admin privileges, it can put shortcuts in the \"All Users\" folder, but if it doesn't then just put them in the current user folder. It should also \"run bitcoin-qt now\" as the user that did the install (not the user that did the elevation).\n\nThe ideal installer would do the following steps:\n1. User runs the installer\n2. User picks the install location\n3. Installer check if it needs to elevate\n3a. If so, the installer requests elevation\n4. The install is preformed\n5. Install shortcuts to All Users if possible, if not install shortcuts to Current User.\n6. If elevated, de-elevate.\n7. Show the \"run bitcoin-qt now\" screen.\n",
