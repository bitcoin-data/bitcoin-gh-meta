   "body" : "Looking at the code in `rpcmining.cpp` with respect to locking of `cs_main` when creating new blocks, I observe two things:\n\n1) The code for `setgenerate` locks `cs_main` only very briefly for calling `IncrementExtraNonce`.  Does that mean that in theory, a block could have arrived between the call to `CreateNewBlock` and `IncrementExtraNonce`, thus making `IncrementExtraNonce` write out a wrong height into the coinbase?  I realise that this is only for regtest mode and thus a non-issue, but it seems \"wrong\" nevertheless.\n\n2) The code for `getblocktemplate`, on the other hand, locks `cs_main` over most of its length.  Because of this, the usage of `pindexPrevNew` (with a comment \"to avoid races\") seems unnecessary.  Or do I miss anything here?\n\nNone of these is an issue I would consider \"critical\" - but both seem a bit inconsistent to me.  Unless I miss some details here, the code in its current form seems, at least, confusing about how locking \"should\" be done.\n",
