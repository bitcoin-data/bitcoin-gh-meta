      "body" : "All the signature verification failed.  I don't think this issue is reproducible here since I'm working with another tech stack (Java), so the crypto libraries might be different. Since the Private and Public Key are hardcoded in the test, the Transaction HASH that is generated during execution time seemed to be the only reasonable point of failure. \r\nI've created another set of test cases on my own, using different private/Pub key pairs, and the new tests are working fine, verifying the signature properly. So my guess is either the transaction serialization algorithm has been changed at some point and not reflected in my code, or this serialisation works in a different way in another tech environment (I don't think this is the case though).\r\n\r\nNow it's fixed in my env, I didn't close the issue myself before because I'm still in the process of replicating all the scenarios.\r\n\r\nThx\r\n\r\n\r\n",
