Nonetheless, this is where I noticed that there where missing files from the new repository and then I realized that this happened because of the contents of .gitignore. \r\nIf this is intentional, then please disregard this issue. \r\nStill, I am a bit confused though - if someone makes changes to the mentioned files, they won't be updated (included in a commit). Are they not meant to be updated? Are the Makefiles generated elsewhere somehow?\r\nMany thanks for taking your time to address this, I really appreciate it!",
