This way he can warn you when something break Windows msvc build. \r\nEven if you are not fan of windows, I think you will see the advantage to have it for your favorite linux distro instead of relying on outdated documentation and untested dev environment.\r\n\r\nIt is also way more useful than maintaining a documentation, as anybody can reproduce the build on their environment just by reading the dockerfile related to their OS.\r\n\r\nSee this as a documentation which can be checked automatically during CI.\r\n\r\nIt also has the advantage that people can easily distribute their own bitcoin core image with their favorite freshly backed commits.\r\n\r\nMy repo https://github.com/NicolasDorier/docker-bitcoin is good if you want just an official release, but I totally see the advantage of providing dockerfiles which build from sources.\r\n\r\nIt is big ACK for me.

In this case testnet/mainnet nodes can be started within one go, scale if needed.

Installing the dependencies is what differs per dist and usually the cause of issues. Instead of having a Dockerfile for each distribution, it seems easier to me to just list the dependencies in a readme (and maybe a one-liner for common distributions to install all dependencies)\r\n\r\nNote that on travis we already use docker, but I don't see how a Dockerfile would simplify anything there.\r\n\r\nIf there is a valid use case for a Dockerfile that makes our process easier, I am all in, otherwise I think this will lead to a maintenance burden and nit-picking, because everyone has their own use case and wants the Dockerfile to match that use case.",

This result in outdated documentation, and additional support when somebody complains that it does not work because some outdated dependencies on their system, also it never get tested and too often people break builds without knowing. @sipsorcery very often report Windows msvc breaks as issues and PR. Those could be easily detected if dockerfile were used and built during CI.",

If we want more devs poking at bitcoin I think it would be good that there was an official Dockerfile here that just gave you a build that you could play with locally (the intention being development, not production). That way you could test your changes easily. I was about to submit one but then saw this effort and decided to pile on my comment. \r\n\r\nI greatly support making it easier for new devs to get a local image running and docker provides exactly that.\r\n\r\nA few prior comments may not be entirely familiar with how docker works. We need provide only one file and that file will be universal and will not require any maintenance as it will self-document all the dependencies. A CI build could be used to verify that the container builds and produces the bitcoind binary, which is all that's necessary to make sure nothing is broken as far as deps go. In this regard it's much simpler than an rpm spec and not directly comparable.",

We use it the way it is to run and scale nodes in prod environment. I'd suggest that better way would be to create a separate pull req for development environment as it will differ significantly and close this if there's no need for prod env. Though, I would agree @skwp that official production friendly docker environment would be nice to have. As for someone having resources it's as easy as one command to run x prod/test nodes in the current containerised infrastructure. And I don't see how it would influence deployment as mentioned by @promag apart from the fact that it would make it much easier to deploy and manage.",
