   "body" : "Changes the logic for querying DNS seeds: after this PR, if there's less than 1000 entries in addrman, it will still usually query DNS seeds after 11s (unless the first few peers tried mostly succeed), but if there's more than 1000 entries it won't try DNS seeds until 5 minutes have passed without getting multiple outbound peers. (If there's 0 entries in addrman, it will still immediately query the DNS seeds). Additionally, delays querying DNS seeds while the p2p network is not active.\r\n\r\nFixes #15434",
