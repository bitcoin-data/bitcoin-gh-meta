Also bumping the Qt version should probably be a separate PR and even then quite controversial. What I find useful from this PR is the 32-bit support which I don't personally care for (don't see the point going forward) but maybe best to work that in on top of [#16110](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16110).",

We occasionally open an issue to bump the QT version in depends (relevant for this), as well as the minimum supported QT version (not really relevant). See also discussion about macOS and QT 5.12 in #16392.\r\n\r\nOnce you figured out how to build an APK, the next important question, brought up in #16883 is whether this APK can built with Gitian, in particular: if there are any non-deterministic build steps.",
