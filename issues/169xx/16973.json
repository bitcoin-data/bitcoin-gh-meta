   "body" : "Fixes #16894\r\n\r\nThis fixes the problem of AppVeyor builds not showing `debug.log` if a functional test fails, because the windows separator `\\` doesn't work together with the regex in `combine_logs.py`.\r\n\r\nA fix was already attempted in  #16896, however, that PR became inactive and was marked \"up for grabs\", plus it's a really small change.\r\n\r\nAs suggested by jamesob, this PR uses `pathlib`: For the glob and to convert the path to a posix-style string, it leaves the regex as is (in contrast to #16896 which adjusted the regex).\r\n\r\nI tested this locally on Windows and Ubuntu.\r\n",
