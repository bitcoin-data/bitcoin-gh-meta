But CPU activity remains at 100%. It seems to happen shortly after it connects to new peers. Calling `setnetworkactive false` before reconsiderblock seems to prevent the issue.\r\n\r\nctrl + c will not stop bitcoind, it doesn't go beyond \"addcon thread exit\" and\r\n\"net thread exit\".\r\n\r\nWhen running QT, it becomes completely unresponsive.\r\n\r\n`bitcoin-cli stop` will say \"Bitcoin Core stopping\", but that's a lie.\r\n\r\nIn addition, calling `reconsiderblock` very early after start, before you see `ERROR: AcceptBlockHeader: block 0000000000000000000212eb9b17aeb6e2a1527923ba79527cd8373f1d44307d is marked invalid`, will prevent the chain from moving until you force-quit.\r\n\r\nLaunching bitcoind without `-checkblockindex=1` doesn't seem to have this issue. \r\n\r\nTried on master @ c3a8e097b1afe27bce2f71817fd23cb857236d9d.\r\n",
