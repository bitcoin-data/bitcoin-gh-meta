      "body" : "It would be useful if there was a way to rerun all ci systems from a single button click (API call) on GitHub (Just a button that does effectively the same as close-open of a pull request). close-open-ing a pull request creates a lot of noise. E.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9384#issuecomment-487407255\r\n\r\nI am aware that travis and other ci systems offer a way to restart a failed build or schedule a new build, but that doesn't update the ci configuration (travis.yml) to the latest version. So this reschedule feature is useless, if a re-run is needed because a bug was fixed in the yml or a silent merge conflict makes the yml no longer work with the latest merged pull request state.\r\n\r\nCurrently the only way to reliably reset the ci config to a clean state and rerun all ci systems (travis, appveyor, ...) with one action is to close and open the pull request. Alternatively, a push or force push to the branch can be done, but usually only the pull request author can do this. And such pushes are generally discouraged because they invalidate previous review.\r\n\r\nFinally, restarting a failed build from within travis will discard the log and thus makes it impossible to troubleshoot the issue later. Restarting the build from GitHub will preserve the old log and start a fresh build with a fresh log.",

Get a commitment for a follow up with a GitHub designer.\r\n\r\nPlan:\r\n1. Provide overview of Bitcoin Core project\r\n2. Highlight specific aspects of the project that stress GitHub UX\r\n3. Show examples / give demos\r\n\r\nThe aspects that will be highlighted:\r\n1. Better granularity of access control (eg don't require commit access to modify labels)\r\n2. UI clutter / notifications noise (nits, downstream projects, unbatched comments)\r\n3. Merging PRs (structured ACK data)\r\n\r\n@theuni can you add other details I missed, particularly adding more detail about merging PRs?",

They (particularly their CEO) seemed to fully understand and appreciate the feedback, particularly the trust minimization philosophy of the project.\r\n- We have a direct line of communication now with the folks we met in case we need to follow up on a design issue, security issue, etc.\r\n- They demo'd some upcoming work which looked like it could be applicable to the project. Cory plans to engage them on that. They asked us to respect confidentiality until it is announced.\r\n- We asked about their Sponsors program, in which they match sponsorship up to $5k per developer, and whether they'd considered accepting bitcoin. I plan to follow up with them on that.\r\n",

If interested, let me know and I'm happy to connect you with Bryan.\r\n\r\n\"Hi Steve -\r\n\r\nI really appreciate the time you all spent with us at GitHub in June. I wanted to offer this invite to you or someone from your team to join our Open Source Advisory Board this year.  Here's the full invite text below:\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with this yearâs GitHub Universe (https://githubuniverse.com/), we are hosting an Open Source Advisory Board, to help us understand how we can better serve the Open Source Community, and what you would like to see from GitHub in the coming year. We would like to invite you, or someone else from your project, to participate in this Advisory Board.\r\n\r\nOur aim with this board, and this invitation is to seek honest feedback from across the Open Source community (whether you use GitHub or not) about what GitHub can do to best support it. We would earnestly like to hear your opinions.\r\n\r\nThis yearâs Open Source Advisory Panel will be held on the afternoon of Tuesday 12 November, in San Francisco, California. Just let us know. Of course, you will also receive complimentary tickets to attend GitHub Universe on 13 and 14 November.\r\n\r\nPlease RSVP by replying to this email if you are interested in participating. We are looking forward to have you join us!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n~ Bryan\"",
