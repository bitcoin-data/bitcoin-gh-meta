   "body" : "As discussed in the April 18 2019 IRC meeting.\r\n\r\nThis makes sending to future Segwit versions via native outputs (bech32) standard for relay, mempool acceptance, and mining. The reasons are:\r\n* This may interfere with smooth adoption of future segwit versions, if they're defined (by the sender wallet/node).\r\n* It violates BIP173 (\"Version 0 witness addresses are always 42 or 62 characters, but implementations MUST allow the use of any version.\"), though admittedly this code was written before BIP173.\r\n* It doesn't protect much, as P2SH-embedded segwit cannot be filtered in this way.\r\n* As a general policy, the sender shouldn't care what the receiver likes his outputs to be.\r\n\r\nNote that _spending_ such outputs (including P2SH-embedded ones) remains nonstandard, as that is actually required for softfork safety.",
