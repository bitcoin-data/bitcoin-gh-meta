Should switch over to a crypto based or at least an open, uncensored community.\r\n\r\nAnyways I have suggestion to increase bitcoin usefulness and value, \"in-wallet exchange listings\"\r\n\r\n_Can we have something like LocalBitcoins.com built into the client?_ Localbitcoins allows you to place \"ads\" for buying or selling bitcoin in person, or over etransfer, etc. all sorted by Country/State/City -- but they recently changed to require KYC :-1: \r\n\r\nThat way everyone can cash in and out of BTC/FIAT with either local meetups, or using email money transfer, etc. without having to provide identifications...\r\n\r\nUsed along with in-wallet hotswaps, this blows away need for exchanges / wash trading / fake volume / fees / etc\r\n\r\nI think is good idea :+1: \r\n\r\nIf not just close ticket. \r\n\r\nThanks :)",
