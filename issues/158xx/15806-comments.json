The long-term goal should be to harden the code and protocol against spy nodes, but we're not there yet.\r\n\r\nMy principle is that I just don't want to maintain a blacklist as part of the bitcoin core project. So if you want to make this change, please add an option to pass in an external list.\r\n",
