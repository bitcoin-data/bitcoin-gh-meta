      "body" : "This is (unfortunately) expected behavior. `getrawtransaction` is correct, `decoderawtransaction` is incorrect.\r\n\r\nThis issue occurs because the transaction is a segwit transaction which can be mistaken for a 0 input transaction by `decoderawtransaction` which needs to decode 0 input transactions. The heuristic used to distinguish between 0 input and segwit transactions that `decoderawtransaction` uses is not foolproof and there are still some false positives, such as your transaction. `getrawtransaction` is not confused because it is fetching the details of a transaction that exists on the network and thus cannot be a 0 input transaction. `decoderawtransaction` gives the wrong txid because it is including the segwit data in the txid when it shouldn't.\r\n\r\n`decoderawtransaction` has an optional parameter `iswitness` which is used to indicate whether it should consider the transaction to be a segwit transaction and decode it as such. You should get the correct result (the same as `getrawtransaction`) if you set that to true (i.e. `bitcoin-cli decoderawtransaction <raw tx> true`).",
