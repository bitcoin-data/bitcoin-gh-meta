Itâs an hour long chat on Fridayâs where you can talk about anything GitHub thatâs on your mind. I was wondering if you all would like to join us. Youâre welcome to bring other maintainers up to a max of about 7 people. Many groups bring a âtop 10â list with them and we go through that. We also have some demos and mockups of stuff to show and then discuss. Tell us how to improve GitHub.\"\r\n\r\nThis Issue is being created to collect ideas for the top 10 list. I would suggest ideas can be anything from annoying UX/reliability issues to feature requests to \"crazy requests that might seem impossible.\" Anything should be on the table.",
