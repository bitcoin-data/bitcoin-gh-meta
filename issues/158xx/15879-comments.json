An attacker would need to solve the discrete logarithm problem to spend your funds based on the id (same level of complexity if one tries to spend bitcoin by only knowing an address)... and, of course the attacker also would need to \"reverse\" RIPEMD-160 (there are AFAIK no known/published collisions).\r\n\r\nIf \"safe\" means that someone **having a really hard time** trying to spend your coins based on the `hdseedid`(`hdmasterkeyid`), then yes. It would say it's \"safe\".",
