It's like Chinese water torture.\r\n\r\nI've tried every trick in the book to attempt to bypass this, but it's just not possible without modifications to the Bitcoin Core source code. I ask you to fix this (a solution is apparently in the link) so that I can run my Bitcoin payment system while using the computer and not go insane from the little windows that keep flashing by!",
