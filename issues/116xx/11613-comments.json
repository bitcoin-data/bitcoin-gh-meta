I suspect \"are all inputs mine\" to generally be more useful,  but it might not be worth the trouble of doing that if that's not easily accessible. If \"is_mine\" just means \"one of the inputs is mine\", I'd suggest keeping that behavior and if needed in the future create an \"is_all_mine\" or something\r\n\r\n> I'm confused. Isn't everything reported by listunspent by definition is_mine?\r\n\r\nHmm not really. listunspent lists all your shit, but you want to know about the source of it.  Consider there two common ways for you to get money: someone sends it to you (not is_mine) or you sent to yourself (i.e. change) and it (is_mine). It makes sense to distinguish these two cases for a variety of things.\r\n\r\nIn my particular case, I do coin-selection outside of core  (I call \"listunspent\" then do coin selection, and generate a transaction) so knowing the source of the unspent is pretty important (as core itself does in it's own coin selection, for example)",

I think there is minor confusion with regards of wording (and please correct me if I'm wrong). ``listunspent`` indeed has ``IsMine`` function being used. And this function is being discussed by others here. However, ``IsMine`` means that 'coins are mine to spend' (is any input mine) and not 'coins source belongs to one of my accounts'. If I understand this issue correctly what you actually want to expose is 'from_me'. Correct?",
