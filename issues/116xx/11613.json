   "body" : "Currently `listunspent` only exposes a `safe` which is coded roughly as `confirmations > 0 || (is_mine && !replaceable)` however a consumer very well might want to distinguish between when it's \"mine\" and when it's not (as I presently need to).\r\n\r\nThis ideally would be extended to listunspent, gettransaction and listtransactions. \r\n\r\n(The `listtransactions` already exposes a \"trusted\" which is basically \"is_mine\" but also uses the spendZeroConf  configuration, which is imho rather confusing. So my suggestion would be that all apis expose a consistent set of \"is_mine\", \"replaceable\" and \"confirmations\" (which is already always exposed) and RPC consumers can use these primitives to make decisions.\r\n",
