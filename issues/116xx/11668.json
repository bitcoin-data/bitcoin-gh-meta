   "body" : "I installed the latest version of Bitcoin on a new computer, everything started up normally and it started synchronizing. I closed the program (waited for it to finish) and reopened. When I did that it now says \"Cannot obtain a lock on data directory C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin. Bitcoin Core is probably already running. Access is denied\".\r\n\r\nI've googled the issue, tried deleting the LOCK file, tried uninstalling/reinstalling, and can't get it to work.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing I changed during the initial installation. When it asked me where I wanted the blockchain data, I changed it to the Program Files\\Bitcoin directory instead of the default user App Data directory. I'm not sure if this is bad or messed something up. \r\n\r\nAfter I uninstalled and reinstalled, it no longer asks me where I want the blockchain data so I don't know how to change that.\r\n",
