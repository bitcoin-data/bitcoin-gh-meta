That seemed to be more complicated to me than just closing and reopening all wallets, especially since order is more guaranteed to be preserved doing that than modifying `vpwallets` directly.\r\n\r\n> I don't even see a reason why the wallet that is being encrypted needs have all it's in-memory state thrown away and then the same data reloaded from disk.\r\n\r\nI thought that there were still some in-memory things that needed to be discarded (e.g. unencrypted keys) to ensure security of the wallet.",
