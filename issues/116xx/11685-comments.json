As @theuni correctly extrapolated in #10269 the build problem on WSL using /mnt/* is related to timestamps. Specifically the timestamps on the Makefile.in files. \r\n\r\nWhen make runs it checks that the timestamps on Makefile and Makefile.in are greater than the Makefile.am. With the dependency packages supplied by Bitcoin Core the Makefile.in files are included, Extracting onto a WSL folder under the default mount of / carries across the timestamps correctly. Extracting onto a native Windows file system under /mnt/* does not and the Makefile.am and Makefile.in  end up with the same timestamp. This puts make into a tizzy so that it launches the whole Automake  build process again and when it can't find the tools it needs, the first of which is automake, it bails.\r\n\r\nI only bothered to verify this with the first dependency with is native_protobuf.\r\n\r\n- /mnt/f/Temp/bitcoin/depends$ make HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32\r\n- The attempt fails as per the OP's original log\r\n- touch /mnt/f/Temp/bitcoin/depends/work/build/x86_64-w64-mingw32/native_protobuf/2.6.1-38b82cbb6fc/Makefile.in\r\n- touch /mnt/f/Temp/bitcoin/depends/work/build/x86_64-w64-mingw32/native_protobuf/2.6.1-38b82cbb6fc/src/Makefile.in\r\n- make V=1 HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32 native_protobuf\r\n- Success\r\n\r\nIt would be easy enough to write a script that touches all the Makefile.in files in src/depends but then there could be other problems further down. The recommendation of building under / is still the better option.\r\n\r\n",
