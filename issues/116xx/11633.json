   "body" : "Following the instructions in the latest master and V0.15.0.1 seem to work (with the PATH fix for v.0.15.0.1) but the resulting binaries are not .exe files - even after running make install.\r\n\r\nWhen running the file from the command prompt, they core dump, and also give the error:-\r\nQXcbConnection: Could not connect to display\r\n\r\nRunning \"file\" on the binaries displays:-\r\nbitcoin-qt: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=15f46d424faaf60811625c0406df1a8b9c214b11, not stripped\r\n\r\nI am following the instructions to the latter, as far as I can tell, but it may be that additional packages have been installed prior to following the build instructions. If this is the cause of the issue, perhaps the instructions could be amended to include instructions to cater for the possibility of additional packages existing (installed), e.g. Qt libraries.\r\n",
