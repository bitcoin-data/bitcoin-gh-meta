   "body" : "All attempts to post this to bitcoin-dev have failed, as any submissions about consensus changes are not approved with the argument that it is off-topic. This is now urgent, and needs addressing proactively in preference to reactively.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1530283/32695398-060ae63e-c78d-11e7-970e-fc3257eaae78.png)\r\n\r\nI would prefer that Bitcoin survive rather than be replaced by Bitcoin Cash. I am in support of smaller blocks and therefore continued decentralization, and also believe that the lightening network is the better way forward. Bitcoin Core is the ideal team to lead the way, but I fear your lead will be lost if the \"death spiral\" occurs.\r\n\r\nWhy isn't this being address nor even allowed to be talked about please? (i.e my post to bitcoin-dev is still awaiting approval).",
