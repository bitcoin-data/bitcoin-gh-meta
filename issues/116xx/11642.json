   "body" : "This is a feature request to add visual hashes for bitcoin addresses wherever it feels needed (Address input fields, list of receiving addresses etc...).\r\n\r\nThe idea is to implement a small identificative image that is deterministically generated using the data (the address in this case) as a seed. Similar to [https://github.com/luxcem/vizhash](https://github.com/luxcem/vizhash)\r\n\r\nThis would solve an issue that has been long around with bitcoin addresses, which is that most users do not fully check (or don't check at all) the address they're pasting into a field hence allowing manipulations to the address by external factors to go easily unnoticed.\r\n\r\nWith a visual hash, the slightiest change to the address would change it's resulting image radically in unpredictable ways. If web services and apps implement the same procedure, this would allow users to spot when the address they wrote is different by quickly comparing the hash image.\r\n\r\nDownside would be that images give a false sense of security, when lots of hashing algorithms are known to be vulnerable to collisions and it's not safe to assume there are no more vulnerabilities yet unknown. It is important to choose the algorithm to generate the images wisely to reduce collisions.\r\n\r\nEven with that in mind, in my opinion, the overall security is increased. Those who never check the addresses would have a fairly secure way of quickly doing it, and those who have been fully checking the addresses until now and are wise enough to understand the risks of not checking the address are probably wise enough to understand the risk of collision too.\r\n\r\nWhat is your opinion on this? Did I miss anything? Is it reasonable to implement this on core?",
