This has been discussed multiple times in multiple venues.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, getinfo requires information from multiple subsystems. The implementation is messy, and the locks all over the place make it difficult and expensive to maintain. Keeping it would mean we can't do refactors to clean up wallet and rpc code, burdening the project with long-term technical debt.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core is an open source project. You are completely free to fork the code and do the work necessary to maintain this code. Complaining that other people aren't doing that work for you achieves nothing.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I suggest we lock this issue. No new substantive arguments are being made to revert the change.",
