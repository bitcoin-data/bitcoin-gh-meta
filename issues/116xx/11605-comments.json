The default value can already be changed with `-walletrbf`. This also happens with, for instance, `-keypool` and `keypoolrefill` RPC. Agree in adding release note but more regarding `-walletrbf` and the impact in coin control, these RPC and the wallet transactions.\r\n\r\nI still think the UI change is independent of this, and subject to other discussion (aim for easier reviews).",

      "body" : "@ryanofsky that previous PR turned on RBF by default for both the wallet and RPC.\r\n\r\nA number of objections were raised. I'll address the ones that I think are relevant:\r\n\r\n@luke-jr (and @instagibbs):\r\n> Probably shouldn't be merged until something can actually use it (preferably from the GUI).\r\n\r\nThat's the case now.\r\n\r\n@RHavar:\r\n> I was supportive of bip125 because it was marketed, sold and even titled: \"Opt-in\". But this simple change in defaults really makes it \"Opt-out\" and will end up causing huge impacts to people who are currently relying on 0-conf transactions, as suddenly everyone is going to be accidentally sending \"opt-in\" RBF.\r\n\r\nI suppose that's unchanged. I think opt-in refers to the fact that it's a soft fork? I think the best way to counter bad press is to make the feature work great and have users and (most) merchants love it.\r\n\r\nThere were some issues with usability at the time, which I'm guessing have been addressed since?\r\n\r\nThere was also discussion about RBF vs. CPFP. Given that the RBF check box made it into the UI, I don't think that's relevant (at least not for the scope of this issue). Although perhaps we could warn users that using RBF breaks the ability of CPFP for the recipient (does it?). I could imagine a merchant using CPFP for large purchases as a customer service gesture.\r\n\r\n@TheBlueMatt:\r\n> Obviously I'd agree we shouldn't do this unless bumpfee goes in.\r\n\r\nThat's there now. \r\n\r\n@gmaxwell:\r\n> As far as your zero-conf comments, that is why my comment here and on the bumpfee PR talk about being able to after-the-fact turn it off.\r\n\r\nIs this currently possible? If not, should we wait for that?\r\n\r\n@RHavar:\r\n> If this is going to be the default, it seems that bumpfee first at least be able to handle all transactions (e.g. ones without change)?\r\n\r\nI don't understand RBF really well, but if transactions without change can't use RBF, it would be good UX to grey-out and the checkbox for those transactions (and set it to disabled). We don't want the wallet to throw errors with default settings. Does it mean you can't send the transaction at all, or just not bump it? Both are problematic though.\r\n\r\n> Likewise it would also make sense to have \"reverttransaction\" as a prerequisite too. It would help people fully realize how revertible bip125 transactions are\r\n\r\nI'd like that feature too, but I think it can be added later.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the bump fee feature is pretty well hidden in the UI, but that's another issue...\r\n\r\nSome original objections might still hold since @laanwj closed it, but others have been addressed since early this year. So it seems useful to discuss this again",

But a setting \"enable bip125 (if we have change)\" is the logical behavior, but annoying to explain.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAll that said, I'm still very against this change. The reiterate my objections:\r\n\r\nBip125 was explicitly sold as \"opt-in\" to turn it to \"opt-out\" is rather distasteful, and has a lot of externalities. \r\n\r\nI would drop this objection if there was a significant (>5%) of hash power that was maliciously mining 0-conf double spends. But there simply isn't.\r\n\r\nMy latest project has in the last weeks processed 279 transactions worth 339 BTC with 0-confirmations transaction (after passing a few safety checks) without a single successful double-spend. I'm aware it's probably going to break horribly in the future, but it would be appreciate if yall didn't go out of your way to break shit that works and gives users a good experience.\r\n\r\nAnd my other objection is, that core users can't even take full advantage of bip125. Unless there's an exposed simple \"bump fee\" (that works reliably) and \"revert transaction\". It seems totally premature to expose users (and the rest of the bitcoin ecosystem) to all the disadvantage of bip125, without at the very least allowing users fully take advantage of it.",

Why not? 6 isn't some magical number. It's up to everyone to decide what risk tolerance to accept (which will greatly depend on how miners are behaving). If a transaction is replaceable, it's pretty rational to require +1 confirmations than you otherwise would. FWIW I've processed 60991 BTC of anonymous deposits at 1 conf, and never had any issues. \r\n\r\nIf miners were being real dicks, then even 6 confirmations is pretty damn weak. But it is so far my estimation that miners have thus-far acted incredibly honestly and avoided engaging in any nonsense like this.\r\n\r\nIf you @Sjors  think you can abuse this, you have my full permission to abuse up to 20 bitcoin in a 1-conf double-spend against bustadice.com (and consider it a bounty) =)\r\n\r\n> There is no currently coded \"auto-CPFP\" currently, and debate on how to do that as a feature. There are very manual ways of doing this, sure.\r\n\r\nSure, and also the addition of \"first seen safe RBF\" is something I'd get behind too. 99% of the time this is just as efficient as full RBF  (assuming you don't do off-peak consolidation, and need to eventually consolidate your unspent anyway) \r\n\r\nThat said, I'm not volunteering to do any of the work. So I won't complain too loudly if this commit is merged. I just would really hate to see breaking stuff that already works.",

      "body" : "I pushed a new version. This led to a conflict, so I also rebased.\r\n\r\n* QT now processes `-walletrbf`, so I no longer need to change the non-GUI files. The exception is `DEFAULT_WALLET_QT_RBF`, which is needed by `wallet/init.cpp` to print the help message. There might be a convoluted way to avoid that, by using `HelpMessageMode=HMM_BITCOIN_QT` to suppress `-walletrbf` and instead show this flag under `UI Options`.\r\n\r\n* I'm not sure if `qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp` is the right place for `gArgs.GetBoolArg(\"-walletrbf\", DEFAULT_WALLET_QT_RBF)`, but that's the same pattern `qt/guiutil.cpp` and `qt/intro.cpp` use.\r\n  * @jonasschnelli did you mean `BitcoinApplication` instead of `GuiMain`? I'm not sure where that would go, and how to then access that from `sendcoinsdialog` (bitcoin.cpp doesn't have a header file).\r\n  * I looked into `OptionsModel`, but as far as I understand what that class is doing, it seems more suitable for global settings that can be toggled. E.g. the display currency can be toggled by the user through a setting, but there's no setting for the user to enable whether or not the RBF checkbox should be on by default. I could make it remember the last choice, but that would increase the scope of this PR. \r\n\r\n* @MarcoFalke I removed `getDefaultWalletRbf` from `WalletModel`\r\n\r\n* Added a release note.",

Coinbase guaranteed the exchange rate as long as they saw the transaction on the network with 15 minutes (even if it takes a few hours to confirm). It's a great user experience for all involved (I know exactly how much bitcoin to send) and the seller knows exactly how much USD they will get (after it's all confirmed, and what not) and coinbase gets their cut.\r\n\r\nNow if you throw in replaceable transactions, everything falls apart. I can trivially revert the transaction if the exchange rate moves in a way beneficial for me (and even tell the vendor I will resend the funds as a diff transaction). \r\n\r\nI mean, the way things are going eventually bitcoin is going to be a pure settlement layer and none of this will really matter. But it's not nearly that yet, so I just don't get where all this motivation to vandalize bitcoin payments is coming from.\r\n\r\nThe concern is ostensibly for user-experience, so while I realize time and energy isn't fungible -- but it would be so much better spent on improving other things (like CPFP workflow, and FSS-RBF and things without such negative effects)",

      "body" : "@RHavar Sadly, neither CPFP nor FSS-RBF are realistic replacements (CPFP has real additional cost, and FSS-RBF, at least as originally proposed, is highly restrictive on types of transactions that can be replaced). Given the community's seeming unwillingness to actually work together, those targeting very short confirmation windows almost certainly don't have any options *except* RBF right now that have reasonable usability. There may be cases where not using RBF is preferable, and I've suggested many times that people who want that put something like no125=1 in their URIs do so, and we should honor such things, but I dont see a mad rush to do that, plus users can easily still turn it off. But for average payments (the vast majority of which require some confirmations either way), RBF is such a better user experience that having it off by default just causes issues for users.\r\n\r\nIf something like this gets turned on more commonly, and major providers see an issue, I'm sure they'd be happy to look into URI options to inform clients to turn it off. But, in general, my daily wallet sets RBF off for all payments and all the exchange-rate-guarantee folks seem to have no problem taking my transactions, I assume because the exchange-rate-movement issues just dont appear in the wild (and if they did and they needed something immediately, I'm *sure* there are lots of folks who'd happily offer short-term options contracts to them at scale for a fraction of the fee someone like Coinbase takes in on payments).",

I'm strongly in favor of making RBF default to on, I realize there are some downsides, but I think they are significantly outweighed by the fact that accurate fee estimation is essentially an impossible task and being able to adjust fee afterwards is the single biggest usability improvement we can offer now.\r\n\r\n2) I think we should flip RPC and QT at the same time.  I recognize there are some small risks with flipping the RPC default, but that can just be release noted.  Separating them is just introducing unnecessary configuration complexity.  It will also be confusing to users that use RPC while running QT and have their transactions go out differently.  Fundamentally the easiest and best thing to do is just change DEFAULT_WALLET_RBF  to true.\r\n\r\n3) I question flipping the meaning of the checkbox, I realize it's kind of silly for it to be always defaulted to checked, but are we not worried some people will just be used to expecting the checkbox to be checked for RBF?  I'm fine being outvoted on this aspect though if we think its short term pain for long term gain.\r\n",

In particular regarding @luke-jr's point.\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke:\r\n\r\n2 - The additional complexity is only three lines of code. It would seem trivial to switch the RPC default over one version later, when people are more familiar with it. The 0.16 release notes (assuming this makes it in) could warn that that's coming in the next version.\r\n\r\nRegarding:\r\n> confusing to users that use RPC while running QT and have their transactions go out differently\": \r\n\r\nAssuming you mean \"differently then when they run RPC without QT\": that shouldn't be the case. I don't think users should expect the RPC (inside QT or otherwise) to behave like the UI in every way. \r\n\r\n3 - I'm fine with changing the word \"disable\" to \"enable\" in the checkbox and checking it by default.

Once thing I'd like to (see someone else) do is go through popular wallets and services to see how they treat RBF payments and how they treat bumped fees. When it's a relatively small user base, Bitcoin Core QT users, that's one thing. At least the sender probably knows a bit more than average about Bitcoin and can community directly with the recipient. But when every Bitcoin ATM's or other automated process that runs Core starts doing this there's a problem.",

The only factor that should constrain that is code complexity. From that perspective it would make sense to have different defaults and use `-walletX` vs. `-rpcX` settings.\r\n\r\nI can't think of many  examples outside RBF where this would make sense. Only memory usage comes to mind; a GUI could use a lot more than a daemon, since people either don't leave it open all the time, or at least are used to quitting applications when their computer gets too slow.\r\n\r\nIt also seems quite easy to add `-guiwalletrbf` at a later stage and undo the entanglement.",

One changes the default in the GUI, one changes the default that's used with RPC. There is no overlap in code between what the options do.\r\n\r\nI really dislike the `(default: %u for RPC, %u for GUI)` help message because it leaves one thing open: what if you use the GUI, but type commands in the debug console?\r\n\r\nAnd I agree with regard to `-rpcwalletrbf` but it's too late for that.\r\n\r\nAt least the GUI option could be a nice setting in the options dialog.

One thing I'd like to (see someone else) do is go through popular wallets and services to see how they treat RBF payments and how they treat bumped fees. When it's a relatively small user base, Bitcoin Core QT users, that's one thing. At least the sender probably knows a bit more than average about Bitcoin and can community directly with the recipient. But when every Bitcoin ATM's or other automated process that runs Core starts doing this there's a problem.",

The current situation is absolutely insane (and tragically foreseeable). While obviously not the cause of the clusterfuck we're in, having clients aggressively blindly outbid each other is not helping.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm still rather skeptical this is anything more than hack. If you want people to low ball fees, and then progressively bump them -- it really should be reliable. In my wallet now I have dozens of transactions that core isn't capable of fee-bumping due to either no change, or the receiver has spent/swept the output.\r\n\r\nIt would also make sense to build this more first class. e.g. Generate 10 transactions with a progressively increasing nlockTime as well as fee rate. (although this is starting to get a bit off topic)\r\n\r\n> If we can't separate the behavior, I don't think we should change the default at all, until we understand what the impact is on automated services with large transaction volumes\r\n\r\nThere's not going to really be any. A year ago or so, it would've been very different when a number of block-explorers and stuff used to reject them (until they confirmed) or show scary warnings. But there's nothing like that today.  (Although they still show scary warnings if you actually do a fee bump, warning about double-spends)",
