This will flush the wallets, clear them from memory, and then reopen them to ensure that no unencrypted keys remain after encrypting.\r\n\r\nThis is marked as WIP because there are a few bugs that I am still trying to figure out.  ~~~is a locking bug that I'm still trying to figure out. After encrypting a wallet from the GUI, the GUI freezes. This appears to be a lock contention issue with `cs_KeyStore` at wallet/crypter.cpp:160. However I can't figure out why this is happening.~~~",
