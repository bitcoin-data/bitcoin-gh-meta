Need someone more familiar with it to weigh in though.",

The example signing request for this particular example: https://pastebin.com/8CFhFP2Z\r\nWhether to change anything in the RPC API or not is up to you of course, but it is confusing to say the least. Might be a good idea for each input to add an optional witness script field with explanation when it should be passed.",
