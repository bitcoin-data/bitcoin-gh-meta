Is there a clear error aborting the wallet load and saying there's a version discrepancy? Or is the wallet allowed to load with incomplete data? If it's the first, then this PR seems good. If it's the second, then allowing a case of data loss to avoid the need to type `--with-incompatible-bdb` doesn't seem like a too appealing tradeoff.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to think about (I don't this is a big concern if error handling above is adequate) is that \"these log files are only relevant in unclean wallet closes\" happens to be true right now. But it wasn't always true in previous releases, and it may not be true again in the future if we want to do something to improve large wallet performance without sacrificing data integrity.\r\n\r\nBut my main question is just whether there's an error or data loss a when 4.8 wallet software tries to open a wallet with 5.3 logs",

Would change to \"If not cleanly closed, then builds with the newer versions of BerkeleyDB will recover using all available log data, but builds with older versions of BerkeleyDB will open the wallet potentially not using all of the recovery data.\"\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18870#discussion_r421604853\r\n\r\n> > Or is the wallet allowed to load with incomplete data?\r\n> \r\n> The wallet is allowed to load. The logs are moved to a backup directory and an error is logged to both the debug.log and db.log. Unless the user is actively monitoring one of those files, they wouldn't know that there is an error and potential data loss.\r\n\r\nOuch. With or without this PR, it seems like dangerous to just throw away logs from future versions like that. I think separately we should implement a fix to prevent this type of data loss, even it is something really cheesy like writing a `wallet.db.ver` file each time we load a wallet with the current Berkeley DB version number, and refusing to load any wallet when (1) `wallet.db.ver` is present and (2) leftover `database/log.??????????` files are present and (3) `wallet.db.ver` is greater than the current berkeley db version. Error message for refusing to load could be something like \"Wallet [name] not shut down cleanly, and was last loaded using a newer version of Berkeley DB. Wallet software built with Berkeley DB version [version] or later is required to recover this wallet.\"\r\n\r\nAll of this makes me less enthusiastic than other reviewers are about this PR. Simplifying the build a little vs creating a new scenario for data loss does not seem like an appealing tradeoff to me, especially when we may want to rely on logs more in the future to deal with wallet performance problems like #18886 / #18904. But it's not a crazy tradeoff and people do love simple build steps, so there's that.",

After that I added bash aliases shortcuts for the various flags and builds, and have been using them since. Perhaps that isn't an optimal way to build?

If someone tries to make wallet backups with the same version but switches distros or distro versions, this will make it a bit easier on them as far as not needing to build a specific BDB. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I think we need to be extra careful because it's possible that while the format is the same between versions, there could be other minor caveats in the BDB code that screw this compatibility up some how. The format is the same, but is the data handled exactly the same by BDB? I'm more curious about this.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should only succeed if they have one of the major versions that are common in repos, rather than any version.
