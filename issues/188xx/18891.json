   "body" : "From https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html:\r\n\r\n> Normally `make` prints each line of the recipe before it is executed. We call this _echoing_ because it gives the appearance that you are typing the lines yourself.\r\n> \r\n> When a line starts with â`@`â, the echoing of that line is suppressed. The â`@`â is discarded before the line is passed to the shell. Typically you would use this for a command whose only effect is to print something, such as an `echo` command to indicate progress through the makefile:\r\n> \r\n> ```Makefile\r\n> @echo About to make distribution files\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nSince there is no way to turn off the `@`-prefix behaviour other than giving the `--just-print` flag (which puts `make` in dry-run mode and thus does not always work properly), we should make sure that we only put `@` where we mean to for debuggability's sake. **In practice, this probably means using `@`-prefix only when we're `@echo`-ing.**\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fbd522721cb89ef0efea0c1bc912c00b268d1c2a/Makefile.am#L83-L85\r\n\r\nWill silence the printing of `$(MAKENSIS) -V2 $(top_builddir)/share/setup.nsi`, which might be useful information. In fact, this whole snippet could just be:\r\n\r\n```Makefile\r\n\t$(MAKENSIS) -V2 $(top_builddir)/share/setup.nsi\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!",
