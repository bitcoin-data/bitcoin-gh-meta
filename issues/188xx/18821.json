Some functionality that are not directly related to prerequisites producing targets could perhaps be simplified if delegated to scripts\r\n2. Eliminating builtin rules and variables e.g. `MAKEFLAGS += --no-builtin-variables`: I've tried this, and it breaks libminiupnpc because it relies on builtin rules.\r\n3. Require a recent-ish bash so that we can use `set -euo pipefail` and catch errors early\r\n4. Use `.RECIPEPREFIX = >` so that we don't use tabs, and IDEs/text editor which try to be smart will stop trying\r\n\r\nA lot of this is from: https://tech.davis-hansson.com/p/make/ (ignore the title)",
