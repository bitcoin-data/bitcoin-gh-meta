      "body" : "> Then the passphrase record can be deleted. Since all of these modifications are updates to existing records, there shouldn't be anything that could remain in slack space that reveals the private keys\r\n\r\nIf you are satisfied overwriting the passphrase record effectively deletes it, it seems like you could also be satisfied that overwriting key records would effectively delete them, and just make a small code change to overwrite them instead of adding a new encryption scheme.\r\n\r\nSupport for this does sound like a good idea either way. Probably would improve encryption performance and make likelihood of old keys being unintentionally recoverable from the database or filesystem smaller. Not the best thing for backwards compatibility if a new wallet by default can't be opened by previous versions of the software, but maybe this could be rolled out gradually and not turned on by default at first.",
