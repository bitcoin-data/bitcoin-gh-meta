There are other circular dependencies still, but those exist independently from the one I was chasing over the last few days.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nCircular dependency: chainparamsbase -> util/system -> chainparamsbase\r\nCircular dependency: index/txindex -> validation -> index/txindex\r\nCircular dependency: policy/fees -> txmempool -> policy/fees\r\nCircular dependency: qt/addresstablemodel -> qt/walletmodel -> qt/addresstablemodel\r\nCircular dependency: qt/bitcoingui -> qt/walletframe -> qt/bitcoingui\r\nCircular dependency: qt/recentrequeststablemodel -> qt/walletmodel -> qt/recentrequeststablemodel\r\nCircular dependency: qt/sendcoinsdialog -> qt/walletmodel -> qt/sendcoinsdialog\r\nCircular dependency: qt/transactiontablemodel -> qt/walletmodel -> qt/transactiontablemodel\r\nCircular dependency: txmempool -> validation -> txmempool\r\nCircular dependency: wallet/fees -> wallet/wallet -> wallet/fees\r\nCircular dependency: wallet/wallet -> wallet/walletdb -> wallet/wallet\r\nCircular dependency: policy/fees -> txmempool -> validation -> policy/fees\r\n```",

Forward declares do not solve that, they only hide the ability to detect it.\r\n\r\nThe sort of circular dependencies we're talking about here are a symptom of badly organized code, and improving it is a worthwhile goal in my opinion - but not at all costs. Sometimes it requires introducing costly abstractions like installing callbacks/signals, which just aren't worth it. Often it can be solved by just moving things appropriately so that module dependencies form a DAG.\r\n\r\nI agree that the advantage can be stated without reference to the linter in that case.",

I just think if the code is badly organized and the PR improves the organization, the PR description should actually say what was wrong with the organization before and how it's improved. I'm definitely willing to believe there's bad organization here, but I think it'd be good to take a few minutes and spell out what the actual problem is before spending too much time chasing linker and linter errors.\r\n\r\n> Sometimes it requires introducing costly abstractions like installing callbacks/signals, which just aren't worth it. Often it can be solved by just moving things appropriately so that module dependencies form a DAG.\r\n\r\nDefinitely agree. I think if someone is introducing virtual classes and callbacks for no other reason than to satisfy the linter they are doing something wrong. I think there are cases like the fee estimation / mempool circular dependency where having modules call back and forth directly, but still be separate modules is a simple and good solution (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15638#discussion_r268718912)",

Currently, it's only a draft and the only proper description is my first (longer) [answer](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18871#issuecomment-624237736) to @sipa regarding latest changes. As this is still a moving target and I am right now trying to overcome the linking error with `shutdown.cpp` any description in the header of this PR would sooner or later become obsolete. So, better not changing it every few minutes as this would only annoy people.\r\n\r\n> I think if someone is introducing virtual classes and callbacks for no other reason than to satisfy the linter they are doing something wrong. \r\n\r\nMy goal is to **change nothing**, that is: no *magic* via extra calls or structures to circumvent obstacles whatsoever. As @sipa said, it's about creating modules that could be used independently from each other. Either I will succeed in creating proper binary modules out of existing structures and functions, or I will have to give up.\r\n\r\nSo I hope it'll work.",
