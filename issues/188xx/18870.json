   "body" : "As noted in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18844#issuecomment-623004113, BDB versions 4.7 through 5.3 inclusive use the same database file format, so the wallet.dat files are compatible between these versions. The thing that is not compatible is the database transaction logs, but those are cleaned up on a clean wallet close. As such, allow people to build with those versions of BDB without needing to pass `--with-incompatible-bdb`. The docs have been updated to reflect this change. They now no longer mention that BDB 4.8 is required. The caveat about the transaction logs is mentioned.\r\n\r\nThis does not change the version of BDB used in the depends system, so we will still ship with BDB 4.8.\r\n\r\nThe search order for BDB was also changed to prefer system BDB and newer versions of BDB in general.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nOne issue I noticed while testing this was that it configure would pick up my system BDB instead of the depends BDB. It's possible that this could effect gitian builds, which would be a bug. Someone more familiar with our build system should check that.",
