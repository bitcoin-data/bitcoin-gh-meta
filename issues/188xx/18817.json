C locale (used by locale-sensitive C standard library functions/POSIX functions and some parts of the C++ standard library such as `std::to_string`) and 3.) C++ locale (used by the C++ input/output library) are three separate things. This comment is about the perhaps surprising interference with the C locale (2) that takes place as part of the Qt initialization.",
