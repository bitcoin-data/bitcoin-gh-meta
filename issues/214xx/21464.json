   "body" : "Often when we're updating mempool entries we update entries that we ultimately end up removing the updated entries shortly thereafter. This patch makes it so that we filter for such entries a bit earlier in processing, which yields a mild improvement for these cases, and is negligible overhead otherwise.\r\n\r\nThere's potential for a better -- but more sophisticated -- algorithm that can be used taking advantage of epochs, but I figured it is better to do something that is simple and works first and upgrade it later as the other epoch mempool work proceeds as it makes the patches for the epoch algorithm simpler to understand, so you can consider this as preparatory work. It could either go in now if it is not controversial, or we could wait until the other patch is ready to go.",
