I'm pretty sure I've tried and was unsuccessful with all other suggestions for the same issue.\n\nAny ideas are greatly appreciated.  Further, I'm a boomer noob, who left programming after the mouse was introduced.\n\nUggh! Wondering if I should delete node and start over without encrypted wallet?\n\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
