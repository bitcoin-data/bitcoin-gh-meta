   "body" : "[As noted by laanwj in PR 19242](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19242#issuecomment-642816084) simplifying the user agent would bring some potential privacy benefits:\r\n\r\n> For what it's worth in web browsers there's currently a trend toward simplifying user agents, creating less variants instead of more. Mostly for privacy reasons. Is signalling this extra information in the user agent useful for the user of the node, or is it simply for statistics for the developers?\r\n\r\n[MarcoFalke notes some potential security benefits](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19242#issuecomment-642822588) in a comment in the same PR:\r\n\r\n> Sometimes remote attacks can only be exploited in a specific environment, putting that specific environment into the ua and sending it to the attacker seems counter productive.\r\n\r\n[And luke-jr in the same PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19242#issuecomment-642943601):\r\n\r\n> You could argue for removing the UA entirely. But so long as it's there, there's no reason to stop other people from using it as intended. (Nobody is forcing anyone to use this if they don't want to.)\r\n\r\nShould we simplify or remove the user agent string (`strSubVersion`)? Why? Why not?",
