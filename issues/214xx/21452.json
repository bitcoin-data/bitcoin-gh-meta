This is a small increase relative to other tests that increase the value to 120, 240, or 480 seconds, but in my testing it seems to be sufficient to resolve this issue for me locally and also in bitcoinbuilds where it previously passed as well:\r\n\r\n- https://bitcoinbuilds.org/?build=8266 (rpc_timeout = 480)\r\n- https://bitcoinbuilds.org/?build=8392 (rpc_timout = 120)\r\n- https://bitcoinbuilds.org/?build=8465 (rpc_timeout = 90)\r\n\r\nI hit this issue every day when testing pull requests, and it would be great to see it resolved.",
