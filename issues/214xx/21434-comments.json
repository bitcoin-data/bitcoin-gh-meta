That said if this is necessary on some platforms it's necessary.\r\n\r\nEdit: well strictly if you want to use file descriptor 0x7fff_ffff you do need a type that can represent 0x8000_0000 which is > int  â¦ using that one extra fd doesn't seem worth the potential edge cases introduced by making this function return a different type though :smile: ",
