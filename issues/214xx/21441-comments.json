There, devs can have a summary of what's the project's current status. Having a build badge in the README is a best-practice widely adopted here in Github.\r\n\r\nThe per-commit status you mentioned is useful for a core developer interested in checking whether their latest push is successful, which is also very important, but not the same as the badge in the README. In essence, no non-core developer will navigate to the latest commit or to the Cirrus website (which I just had to do, hence this PR) to check if the project is correctly building.",

If you want to make meaningful contributions, I've collected some pointers for you.\r\n\r\n## Getting started to contribute to Bitcoin Core\r\n\r\n### Setting up your development environment\r\n\r\nNew developers are very welcome and needed. There are a lot of open issues of any difficulty waiting to be fixed. However, before you start contributing, familiarize yourself with the Bitcoin Core build system and tests. Refer to the documentation in the repository on how to build Bitcoin Core and how to run the unit and functional tests. Once that is done, you are all set.\r\n\r\nIf you need more help getting started, please refer to the following resources:\r\n\r\n* https://medium.com/@amitiu/onboarding-to-bitcoin-core-7c1a83b20365\r\n* https://jonatack.github.io/articles/how-to-review-pull-requests-in-bitcoin-core\r\n\r\n### Pick something to work on\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for useful contributions to help out with, you can\r\n\r\n* Search through the [good first issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)s or the ones that are [up for grabs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22Up+for+grabs%22). Some of them might no longer be applicable. So if you are interested, but unsure, you might want to leave a comment on the issue first.\r\n* Write tests to improve the coverage. Any kind of test is welcome and coverage information can be obtained from a relatively recent [coverage report](https://marcofalke.github.io/btc_cov). If you are unsure, don't hesitate to check back first.\r\n* Help with review and testing. There are easy ones such as the [gui](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3AGUI) and [rpc](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3ARPC%2FREST%2FZMQ). However, review on any open pull request is welcome. Review will also help you understand the codebase better.\r\n* Help on meta projects related to Bitcoin Core, such as a [high-level performance monitor](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/bitcoinperf).\r\n* Join us on irc and let us know what you are interested in.",
