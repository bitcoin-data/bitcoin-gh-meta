      "body" : "It's not really moved out. The ProcessBlock logic just inserts a block after basic checks into the block database, and then calls ActivateBestChain to reorganize until a stable point is reached. Since inserting a block into the database may cause anything between 0 and infinity blocks to processed, it doesn't really make sense for it to return a specific rejection reason anymore (furthermore, we need to handle those rejection reasons internally during the reorg to find what to do next).\n\nThis affects #1816 and #3727 too (I've mentioned this problem in #3727, but wasn't aware it had further implications).\n\nThere are two solutions, IMHO:\n- Either have a more generic callback mechanism to be informed about block validity checks when they happen (rather than just a nodeid now), so submitblock etc can install their own handler to catch the result and report about it, in addition to ProcessBlock installing a nodeid listener that does BIP61 rejection notice or DOS banning.\n- Make submitblock call ConnectBlock directly (which should always work if its predecessor is the current tip, and otherwise submitblock should already fail anyway). The problem with this is some logic which is in AcceptBlock rather than ConnectBlock or CheckBlock, so would need to be duplicated (in particular, BIP34 version checks). Moving those should be easy, though.\n\nThe first solution is more generic and allows for better decoupling of network handling and consensus rules, but the second is probably faster to do.\n",
