The overhead of recreating the block-chain is low, but we could avoid it in some cases. Other reason to let people add block test cases to a single file is that test cases involving transactions require pre-mined coinbases. If each test must recreate the block-chain, it must start with mining 100 blocks in order to have 50 BTC mature.\n\nAs an example, most of the block tests in TheBlueMatt FullBlockTestGenerator.java are independent of order. (off-topic: nevertheless they are painfully linked together with references to previous blocks: Block b47 = createNextBlock(b46, ....), this can be avoided by an internal reference of the last tip)\n\nSo we could create a single empty file \"block_tests.cpp\" where people can easily add tests by including their own files using #include at the end, and at the same time, for the tests that require a new block-chain, people put them in separate files, and they clear the block-chain before each test using #4688 \n",

Then it becomes impossible to disable tests without affecting others. I think we've all worked with hairballs like that, so I'd prefer to avoid it. They are called 'unit tests' for a good reason.\n\nThe whole reason for merging this (and allowing the skip proof-of-work) was to make building blockchains extremely cheap, so unless the overhead becomes serious I'd prefer to just start from scratch for each test.

The purpose of the first is to test whether the code behaves as the implementer intends it to work. The purpose of the second is to detect consensus and other cross-implementation compatibility.\n\nI would be strongly opposed to converting comparison tool into a unit test. It means that for example a change in serialization code keeps bitcoind compatible with itself, but not with other nodes on the network (including older versions of bitcoind).\n\nI am in favor of replacing comparison tool with a more general framework (using no Bitcoin core code), preferably in a different language, that replays scenarios of network interactions, and verifies that state running bitcoind (or other code) behaves as expected. See #4545.\n",
