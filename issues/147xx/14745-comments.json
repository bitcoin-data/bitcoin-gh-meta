It should be improved but not amputated.\r\nEveryone who is doing a fork is doing a Bitcoin newborn and should have the same features that Satoshi's work provided to us.\r\nOf course I am doing my own stratum pool, but removing features from Bitcoin is not the way to help the Crypto ecosystem to develop and improve.\r\nBecause of these problems most altcoins are using code 4-5 years old, and do not benefit of all the new features created by the Bitcoin core team. The Bitcoin core team is leading the crypto research, and should provide the features that Satoshi intended us to have when we fork and start a coin from scratch using his code.\r\nBitcoin should federate all the new features, have all the encryption algo included as option etc... that mean it should extend and represent the core of any crypto money instead of removing feature and becoming a coin difficult to fork, difficult to mine for students and people who cannot afford to have a stratum mining dedicated server to learn how the blockchain is working.\r\nThat's my opinion, and I hope that in the future, Bitcoin core will preserve the original features of Satoshi Nakamoto,  and will be preserved intact for the sake of learning not only for investors use.\r\nThanks for your time and explanation though, I appreciate.",
