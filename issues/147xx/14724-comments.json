For example, what if you are just consolidating some outputs down to one (e.g.- sending to long term cold storage) and want to have the ability to adjust the fee later if it ends up taking longer than you want to wait? Is this really a bug report that the bumpfee feature in the GUI wallet does not work as expected?",
