   "body" : "A huge part of the success of Bitcoin is because it is the base of most altcoin existing. Now the Bitcoin Core team seems to stop supporting forks and altcoin by removing important piece of code, that could be left here and would greatly help new coins creation.\r\n\r\nNo more CPU mining, no more GPU mining, no more RPC mining, no more solo mining = no more forks and new coins build on the top of Satoshi's work!\r\n\r\nNow you MUST use a pool to mine Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nI understand that Bitcoin has become too expensive to be solo mined, but what about people learning or doing altcoins? No more legacy?\r\n\r\nBecause only the latest versions of Bitcoin Core are running with the latest OS, if you get  version 0.12 that is pre CPU solo removal, it won't compile because autogen.sh is incompatible.\r\n\r\nSo is the goal of the Bitcoin Core team to become an elitist projet that can no longer be forked?\r\n\r\nBecause if you fork Bitcoin as it is now, there is no way that your fork can be mined. So you are killing the possibility of new coins being created by a fork of the latest version of Bitcoin Core?\r\n\r\nWhy removing these part of the code, I don't think Satoshi would like to see his coin being stripped from pieces of code that are indispensable if you want to create a new coin based on Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nAfter the genesis, you need to mine right? \r\n\r\nI want to know what is the idea of the Bitcoin core team when they are removing important piece of code that are blocking the possibility to create new coins based on their work.\r\n\r\nThanks",
