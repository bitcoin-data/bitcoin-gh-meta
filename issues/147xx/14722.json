I inspected the traffic and saw that indeed it is not honoring my `-proxy` setting.\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nBitcoin Core Daemon version v0.17.0.1-9e87d82e7\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nOS: Qubes OS, Whonix 14 VM\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
