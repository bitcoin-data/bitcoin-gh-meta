At this point October feels like the calm before the storm.\r\n\r\nNote that he mentions change of POW only if the majority hashrate is with Segwit2x, but user majority is still with Bitcoin Core, otherwise he implies that developers would simply leave, but what developers ultimately do is their choice of course.",
