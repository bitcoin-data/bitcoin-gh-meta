Otherwise, if a complete rescan was not\r\n * possible (due to pruning or corruption), returns pointer to the most recent\r\n * block that could not be scanned.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not strictly true. If `abortrescan` is called, then `ScanForWalletTransactions()` will return `nullptr`, even though the scan wasn't successful to the tip.\r\n\r\nThis in turn causes a minor bug in `importmulti`, where the call doesn't return the correct error and warning about potentially not finding transactions if `abortrescan` was called.\r\n\r\nI think the correct fix is for `ScanForWalletTransactions()` to inform the caller that the rescan was aborted.",
