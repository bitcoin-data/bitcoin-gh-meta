All other attempts are denied.\r\n\r\nThree reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Payers might believe they can send a payment to an old address to pay for a bill. That is wrong, but if it happens, the payee would need to go hunting for their payment, or else coldly deny them their service.\r\n2. The correct amount is required. (advantage is obvious)\r\n3. Some people think they can just donate to any address that they believe you hold, and I guess that works technically, but from an accounting stand-point, it is not certain which fund a donation might go to. You'd need to create a new minor account for dust transactions that you never intended to receive.\r\n\r\nIs this possible at any level?",
