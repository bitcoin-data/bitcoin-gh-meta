If I use a hostname it doesn't attempt to connect (I don't see any attempts to connect on the remote host or the localhost). If I use the IP address of the host, it works as expected. I am able to get the ip on the localhost if I run the dig command, so it seems the hostname is resolving correctly.\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue?
