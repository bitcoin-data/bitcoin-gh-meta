Should we ignore the message? Should be back-patch addrv2 support into the existing connection?\r\n\r\nThe reason for adding the disconnection is that at `verack` time the protocol negotiation is finalized. This might allow for some kinds of optimizations, as well as knowing for sure whether a peer supports addrv1 or not at a clear point in time. This is useful if in the future there are plans to phase out addrv1.",

      "body" : "> ~0 on this, I'd prefer to keep it as is if remotely possible, and not change mainnet logic for a temporary signet issue at the least.\r\n\r\nIt's not a signet issue; it's a \"nodes running #19954 (oct 11) can't communicate with nodes running #20564 (dec 9)\" issue. That happens to affect signet seriously, since signet was only merged a couple of weeks earlier (sep 21), so all existing signet nodes that haven't updated in the past week are running code that's incompatible with current master/rc3.\r\n\r\nI thought the whole point of #20564 was to avoid disconnecting peers running other software unnecessarily, so I'm at a complete loss as to why we'd want to simultaneously introduce code that disconnects earlier versions of our own code, especially ones that have already been release candidates. This just makes absolutely no sense to me.\r\n\r\n> > Deliberately disconnecting nodes for behaving in ways we know is not harmful seems very backwards to me.\r\n> \r\n> It's not harmful but also, it's unclear what to do in that case? Should we ignore the message?\r\n\r\nYes. Ignoring messages is how we tolerate other nodes doing protocols we don't support -- in this case the unsupported protocol is the earlier version of sendaddrv2/bip155.\r\n\r\n> Should be back-patch addrv2 support into the existing connection?\r\n\r\nThat would be fine too -- it'd be removing three lines of code instead of one -- but it doesn't seem particularly necessary. The idea isn't that you have to support every protocol every other node uses, you just have to tolerate them as far as reasonably possible.\r\n\r\n> The reason for adding the disconnection is that at `verack` time the protocol negotiation is finalized. This might allow for some kinds of optimizations, as well as knowing for sure whether a peer supports addrv1 or not at a clear point in time. This is useful if in the future there are plans to phase out addrv1.\r\n\r\nThat's the reason for finalising it before verack, and ignoring it afterwards; it's not a reason for disconnecting peers who send it afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe reason for adding the disconnection is just to make it as obvious as possible for anyone developing new software and testing it against core that they've misimplemented the spec ([ref](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-iab-protocol-maintenance-04#section-7))-- they'll test it, get an immediate disconnect, debug it, read the spec and go \"oops\" and fix it. Or at least that was the reasoning for disconnecting when receiving wtxidrelay late. And that's free if you've got a new message for the feature that no one else has ever used before in an incompatible way. But while that was true for wtxidrelay, it's not true for sendaddrv2. It's obviously not true on signet, but it's not true on mainnet either.\r\n\r\nI mean, ultimately, it doesn't matter -- everyone running master/0.21rc's released this past quarter will upgrade pretty soon, and if the upgrade's a bit ugly, that's survivable too. But keeping our p2p graph well connected is pretty important, and this just seems... way too carefree for something that important is the politest phrasing I can come up with.",

The possibility of just ignoring it if it arrives too late also exists, and doesn't incur the risk of needing to forever support clients requesting it late either.\n\nConceptually, I think it makes sense to disconnect connections whenever a peer asks us something we cannot provide, and we have no less invasive way of signalling that. E.g. we disconnect a peer that asks for a block we don't have, because it's the polite thing to do - otherwise they'd keep waiting for us.\n\nI don't think that really applies here. sendaddrv2 means \"I understand addrv2 and prefer it\", but it's only a minor disservice to a peer to not obey it. That's not the same as wtxid relay, which specifies that transaction announcements must use wtx - in that case there is no way we can still service the peer's request.\n\nI don't think it's a disaster to disconnect on late sendaddrv2, as it is a violation of the protocol spec. But there also isn't a very strong reason for it.",

All version that are affected by the incompatibility won't be made compatible with this change. This simply changes incompatibility by disconnection to incompatibility  by not sending addrv2. Disconnection makes it easier to spot incorrectly implemented new software, because not everyone reads the debug log or even has -debug=net enabled. So longer term, if this gets merged, it might also be good to revert it back to disconnection.",
