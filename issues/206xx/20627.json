   "body" : "It seems like migrating to Qt6 is a win for multiple efforts, and I want us to evaluate switching to it as an alternative to monkey-patching Qt5/qmake to make it work properly.\r\n\r\n1. First class support for Apple Silicon for #20371 (see: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-85279)\r\n2. Transition from `qmake` to `cmake` (see: https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-6-build-system)\r\n\t1. We already use `cmake` in depends to build several other tools\r\n\t2. `cmake` is much better maintained than `qmake`\r\n\t3. This might make a native/build split possible for `qt`, the last holdout package of native/build mixing after `boost` was recently split\r\n\t4. For PRs like #20600, where we're trying to work around `qmake`'s jankiness, I don't want people to pour their heart and soul into making `qmake` work just to be completely replaced by `cmake` when we bump in the future\r\n\r\nSupposedly, the switching cost is also minimal, as there's a Qt5Compat module (see: https://www.qt.io/blog/porting-from-qt-5-to-qt-6-using-qt5compat-library)",
