   "body" : "The rationale for the PR is the same as for #18132:\r\n> Most of our test scripts are written in python. We don't have enough reviewers for bash scripts and they tend to be clumsy anyway. Especially when it comes to argument parsing.\r\n\r\nNote that there are still a lot of things that could be improved in this replacement (e.g. using regexps for version string parsing, adding type annotations, dividing up into more functions, getting a pylint score closer to 10, etc.), but I found the original shell script quite hard to read, so it's possibly still a good first step for an improvement.\r\n~Not sure though if it's worth the reviewers time, and if it's even continued to be used long-term (maybe there are plans to merge it with `get_previous_releases.py`, which partly does the same?), so chasing for Concept ACKs right now.~",
