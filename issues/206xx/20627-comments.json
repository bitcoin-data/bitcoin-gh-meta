I'm actually working (I suck at build stuff) on reverting to single archive in qt depends (requires an additional patch for 5.9.8) and simplifies adding qtdeclarative and qtquickcontrols2 modules (remaining modules are skipped ofc) or even qtmultimedia in the future for qrcode scanning.\r\n\r\nAlso worth mentioning that Qt6 requires C++17, which we already enabled for next version (#20413).",
