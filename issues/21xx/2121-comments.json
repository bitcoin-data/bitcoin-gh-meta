I'm going to be using this functionality for an upcoming new version of [Coinpunk](http://coinpunk.org), to support client-side encryption for private keys, so that `bitcoind` becomes a listener, and cannot spend any of the user's money. This is a huge linchpin in my new version, and it enables this capability for people developing web services and offline clients that use a central `bitcoind` instance to keep up with the blockchain while they are offline. And of course cold storage wallets that generate the private keys on their own end.\n\nI won't be able to release the new Coinpunk until this is released, so it would be amazing if this commit could get into the next release. I don't think it's too dangerous, just because I believe it's not handling anything that could potentially lose bitcoins, but I could be mistaken. But it would be awesome.\n\nLet me know if I can help in any way. Thanks, you guys are awesome. :-)\n",

Since bitcoind is not going to access the keys anyway while they're encrypted, it shouldn't matter that they're actually zeros. So that will effectively produce watch-only addresses. However, it still wouldn't be possible to add new watch-only addresses via rpc, which this patch can do.\n\nBy the way, could a slightly cleaner implementation of this be to store watch-only addresses as normal keys (except where the encrypted private key is cleared) instead of adding the new \"address\" data type in the walletdb?\n",

I strongly believe that this code solves a critically urgent security problem.\n\nWithout this code, I'm concerned that we may get more services that put private keys on servers simply because they have no choice, which could lead to more major thefts, which could contribute to undermining the soundness of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The last thing Bitcoin needs right now is another high profile wallet theft fiasco.\n\nThis is a very important and very significant security upgrade, that I believe will dramatically lead to the improvement of security across the board, for many different types of applications. To provide analogies, this could be as important to bitcoind security as ProPolice was to buffer overflow prevention, or PBKDF2 was to password hashing.\n\nPlease consider including this in the next release of bitcoind. Do it for the people that have lost a lot of money to server wallet thefts. _Do it for the children._\n\n:wink: \n",

Which makes me excited about its potential to improve bitcoin security, but also terrified because they are using it with unstable bitcoind. It would be really great if someone was able to look at this, I really doubt it would take more than a few hours for a seasoned member of the glorious, highly talented bitcoin development team to resolve the merge conflicts on it (@sipa? @jgarzik?).\n",
