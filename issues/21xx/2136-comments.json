      "body" : "Why not open one for 16 bit micro-controllers?  Some of them have have comparable or greater computing powerâ seriously. The rpi spends most of its gates on the videcore dsp which isn't available to open source software. The cpu is a very minimal single issue armv6 with effectively no cache (the on chip cache is primarily reserved for the dsp).  While I'm sure people can do all sorts of great things with bitcoin on the rpi something like picocoin would be much better software to work with than the reference software.\n\nIf you're looking for small/low power hardware to run the reference bitcoin software I'd recommend looking at http://www.hardkernel.com/renewal_2011/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G135341370451\n\nIf running it on the pi reveals some interesting bugs or sore spots in performance that could be improved for all platforms, then that would be good news.  But I would be opposed to adding complexity or confusing security tradeoffs to accommodate such a limited platform.\n",
