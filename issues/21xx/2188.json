   "body" : "This actually simplifies some SPV code, as they can keep track of\na filtered block and its txn before accepting both in one step.\nThe previous argument was that SPV nodes should handle the txn the\nsame as any other free txn and then mark them as connected to a\nblock when they get the filtered block itself.  However, it now\nappears that SPV nodes will need to put in more effort to verify\nloose txn than they would to verify txn in blocks, thus making it\nmore approriate to send the txn after the filtered block.\n",
