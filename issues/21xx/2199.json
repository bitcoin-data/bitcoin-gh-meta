   "body" : "This is just a suggestion to assist in re-thinking our current thread priorities and assists (IMHO) in easily setting priorities for threads during the creation time of the thread.\n\nI chose to change some default thread priorities, which should also be considered to be part of a discussion. I'm currently using that code and can verify the internal miner did quite happily find new blocks ;).\n\nThat pull could be extended to give users the ability to set the default thread prio via command-line or GUI option.\n- removes SetThreadPriority() and integrates that into NewThread() with a\n  default of THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL\n- removes special-casing (priority switching) for internal Bitcoin miner\n- uses a new default for the following threads: ThreadScriptCheck (below\n  normal - because normal prio threads on every CPU core could slowdown UX),\n  ThreadImport (above normal - to speed it up a little) and\n  ThreadBitcoinMiner (below normal - to compensate the removed special\n  casing)\n- removes thread priority code for non-Windows OSes, so these will just\n  get a no-op\n",
