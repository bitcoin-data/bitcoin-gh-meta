It is way too late to mess with github now!\n\n---\n\nTest the upgrade-to-release-0.8 code - Windows XP with an NTFS filesystem, upgrade from v0.7.1-beta\n\nCPU AMD Athlon 64X2 Dual Core 4800+, Chipset AMD 780G/SB700, 2 GB RAM, HDD 74 GB WD Raptor 10k RPM SATA, Swap file 4 GB fixed size, Windows XP SP3 latest build.\n\nBitcoin-qt runs as server, using empty wallet.\n\nBitcoin datadir before test started, client synced with network and shutdown, debug.log deleted = 5,92 GB\nBitcoin datadir after reindexing blocks = 11,1 GB\nDirectories created and their sizes after reindexing blocks:\n\n/blktree 29.7 MB\n/blocks 5.06 GB\n/coins 143 MB\n\nBitcoin-qt.exe process CPU usage while reindexing blocks = mostly 50%, peaks at 90%\nBitcoin-qt.exe process RAM usage while reindexing blocks = 40 MB to 120 MB, peaks at 200 MB\nHDD activity while reindexing blocks = minimal\n\nNoticable reindexing slowdown at around 25k and 60k blocks to go.\nMajor reindexing slowdown at around 5.5k blocks to go.\nIt seems mentioned slowdowns happen while other nodes on network pull blockchain data. My connection max\nupload speed is just 32 kB. \"Bytes sent\" for bitcoin-qt on my firewall tend to go crazy and abruptly jump to\nimpossible values, like 100 MB uploaded after 10 or so minutes, which is not even remotely possible. Neither\nTerracoin nor Freicoin clients have same or similar issue. \n\nAt around 3k block to go I shutdown bitcoin-qt.exe in attempt to get rid off leechers, clueless = bitcoin-qt exited with error:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ybYWO.png\n\nBitcoin-qt restarted, reindexing not speeding up even a bit so I shutdown it again = same error as previously.\nComputer restarted, including ADSL modem, bitcoin-qt started again = same slow reindexing, crash after few minutes with error:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/whzjF.png\n\nAnother start, slow reindexing but no crash = reindexing completed, bitcoin-qt shutdown at block 215.911\nOne more start, just to check for errors = all fine, bitcoin-qt shutdown at block 215.912\n\nLog file:\n\nhttp://www.sendspace.com/file/twtwsa\n",
