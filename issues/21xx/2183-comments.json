It can by definition not do anything but verify every transaction in history.\n\nThere are a number of solutions, if this is a problem:\n- If you're unable to spend the resources required, you can run a lightweigh (SPV) client like MultiBit, which uses a lower security model, but is a lot faster (as it doesn't verify transactions, only block headers) and doesn't need to store transactions the user isn't interested in.\n- Even though a fully validation node is required to verify everything, it doesn't necessarily need to store everything indefinitely. Changing this poses risks to the network (as nodes still need to find archive nodes that do have history to bootstrap from), but it will probably be implemented some time.\n- We might move to a model where the client also incorporates a lighter security model, and upgrades itself when possible/chosen by the user. This is a big change, and will probably take a while before it is implemented.\n",
