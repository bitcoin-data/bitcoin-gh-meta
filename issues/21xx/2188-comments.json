I think the fact that you feel the need to defend it this way is a sign that it may be too immature to include.  Better protocols can come in the future, but old ones need to be supported a long time.\n\nWRT latency, you're talking about 1x RTT for an event that happens once per ten minutes in the steady state. Or an overhead or a 0.01% performance difference for 100ms RTT.  Am I missing something there?\n",

This pull itself one could argue is being railroaded, but only because it doesnt make sense for the bloom code as-is to be included in any releases (in part due to changes to bitcoinj that are also only just now happening).  Also, the minute difference that this pull represents, IMHO, is really not something that merits a large discussion.\n",

This tweak is not essential but simplifies the code on the client side when various changes that I just posted about to bitcoin-security are implemented. There's no reason not to do it. More generally - perfect is the enemy of the good. Bitcoin does not have infinite time. It isn't something to polish in an ivory tower, after all, Bitcoin already came to the world in a far from perfect state. If SPV clients have acceptable performance 5 years from now it will be irrelevant, people will have either given up on Bitcoin or all be using ad-hoc protocols that talk to different kinds of servers, Electrum style. Forward progress is essential and these changes have taken too long already.\n",
