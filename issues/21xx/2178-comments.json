Maybe there could be a problem there. I don't know.\n\nNevertheless it could be possible to achieve the same attack via a timing attack using SyncWithWallets() as an oracle.\nIt is called just after tx.AcceptToMemoryPool(). An attacker could try to measure how much time  SyncWithWallets() takes by sending a \"ping\" right after a transaction.\n\nI really don't know if this last attack is practical.  \n\nBut SyncWithWallets() does a lot of things that could take measurable time:\n1- Loops over all user wallets ( SyncWithWallets())\n2- Loops over mapWallet (CWallet::OrderedTxItems())\n3- Loops over CAccountingEntry entries..(CWallet::AddToWallet())\n4 -Loops over all transaction outputs.(CWallet::AddToWallet())\n5- Loops over all transaction inputs (WalletUpdateSpent())\n\nThere are too many cases to analyze one by one for me now, and two loops that the attacker could control the number of executions. It would be a good idea to measure the time SyncWithWallets()  takes per previn/prevout/waller/etc.\nIf the measurements show that it can take over 10 msec  then we could have an attack vector.\n\nIt would be better to detach SyncWithWallets() and execute the method in a different thread in order to prevent to attack more or less \"by design\". \nNevertheless, the attacker could still try to measure the responsiveness of the peer and detect background processing even if  SyncWithWallets() runs in another thread. But IMHO trying to protect oneself from this last attack would be a bit paranoic, \n",

If generating a new keypair takes 2 msec, 50x amplification requires the attacker to be able to remotely detect an additional 100 msec from a normal round-trip delay of a message, which seems possible..\nSo this attack is much worse than the timing attack I published a couple of days ago (14 minutes vs 24 days)\n\nNevertheless, if we monitor all the output transactions of a peer, then we probably don't need to test for the 1M existent addresses but for only each new address we watch going out of the peer, then the attack becomes completely realistic.\n\nFor each new address we see, it takes only 35 milliseconds to check if it was the default key that was used!\n",
