It also builds on top of #10571.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits `signrawtransaction` into two commands, `signrawtransactionwithkey` and `signrawtransactionwithwallet`. `signrawtransactionwithkey` requires private keys to be passed in and does not use the wallet for any signing. `signrawtransactionwithwallet` uses the wallet to sign a raw transaction and does not have any parameters to take private keys.\r\n\r\nThe `signrawtransaction` RPC has been marked as deprecated and will call the appropriate RPC command based upon the parameters given. A test was added to check this behavior is still consistent with the original behavior.\r\n\r\nAll tests that used `signrawtransaction` have been updated to use one of the two new RPCs. Most uses were changed to `signrawtransactionwithwallet`. These were changed via a scripted diff.",
