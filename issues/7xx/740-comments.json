      "body" : "well, ... 1000x is perhaps an exaggeration. More like 40-50x or so.   A _complete chain_ syncup here took 29 minutes on code with all the mlock removed. On the same system syncing to about height 37k took three and a half hours earlier today.  I'm not patient enough to benchmark a complete chain syncup without the fix, though perhaps someone else will.\n\nThis problem was really tricky to findâ oprofile cycle sampling was completely blind to the slowdown caused by mlock, I guess if I had hooked GLOBAL_TLB_FLUSHES I would have seen it but who would guess to do that?  Valgrind's callgrind couldn't see it (unsurprisingly).  I eventually found it with ltrace. \n\nIn general we shouldn't be calling mlock per-allocation for _anything_. Even on private key data it's really too slow to use more than a couple times during execution, though I guess it's not completely horrific if just used for that.  Instead we should pre-allocate a mlocked arena and allocate from that for private keys. Perhaps boost has something to make this easier?\n\nIndependent of the that, CDataStream's wide usage and allocation behavior make me cringe.  It's creating a LOT of tiny indirect heap allocation calls all over the code. That can't be good for performance. (though obviously not on the same scale as the mlock overuse)\n",

I'd have to dump the allocator usage data to see how much overhead that might  have. (e.g. add a word after (and perhaps before) every allocation which is checked on free)\n\nI think the mlock security improvement is pretty inconsequential. The significance of the zeroizing at making use-after-free exploits hard is more significant.

Users with encrypted wallets will often do a mass refill when they unlock.   To resolve that the frequency of mlocking should be reduced.  The pool allocator I linked to above should make that easy to use (make secure_allocator use the pool, make the pool use malloc + mlock).\n\nThe frequent mlock usage may also be creating security weaknesses in the form of mlock ineffectiveness. If the process leaks mlocked pages then eventually it will hit the limit (e.g. I think most linux desktops have a 1MB/process limit or something like that), and past the limit pages will no longer be mlocked.\n",
