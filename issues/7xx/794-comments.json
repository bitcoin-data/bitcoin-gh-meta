This would quietly succeed, doing nothing, for transactions which weren't in the memory pool, but it was decrementing the pool size counter even if it didn't remove the transaction, leading to the pool size counter wrapping around to a huge value.\n\nSo my change checks to see if each transaction is in the memory pool before attempting to remove it from the pool.\n",

I think it would be good to give this option to full node operators who aren't mining. So far various patches have been included that help raise mining fees. Such a patch would help to encourage miners to include free txs thereby lowering mining fees. I believe it should be down to the node operators to decide/vote on mining fees rather than the developers. I suspect that the value of bitcoin could be affected by such a change. Perhaps the more mining fees go up, the higher the value of a bitcoin increases too? If so, that would explain a motivation for the developers (who probably own substantial bitcoins) to see the mining fees increase.\n",
