After defragmenting blk0001.dat rate jumped to few tens of blocks/sec. Tested with latest 0.6 version.\n\nThis is serious issue and it seems that client doesn't use buffering at all. If you're about to write block to disk, instead write it to 4MB (adjustable) memory-buffer. Do the same with other blocks until buffer is filled up, then commit whole block to disk. This simple fix should help greatly.\n",

After I close the client, I must wait half a minute to see that its process is actually killed.

Before that, I temporarily closed the client and defragmented blkindex.dat and debug.log. I see that debug.log is written frequently but I think it's too small to cause such slow downs.\n\nI did look at the IO stats and I saw that bitcoin process reads at rate up to 10 MB/s and writes up to 8 MB/s. Speed dropped to 5-10 blocks/sec. Does it scan the whole index for each block?\n\nIt seems that downloading gets slower, proportionally to the number of received blocks.\n",
