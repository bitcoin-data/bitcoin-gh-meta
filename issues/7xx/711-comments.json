If my wallet is corrupt, then I really want to know about it; maybe my hard disk is going bad and it is time to buy a new machine.\n\nBut just throwing an uncaught exception as bitcoin does now is definitely the WRONG thing to do. Lets brainstorm a little on the best way to fix it:\n\nFirst, it seems to me telling the user should be told that their wallet file is corrupted.\nThen maybe: give the user a choice: exit Bitcoin (they can restore from a good backup), or try to recover.\n\nI'd like to see a \"Try to Recover\" that took a \"first, do no harm\" approach and did something like:\n- Closed/renamed the existing wallet.dat\n- Rewrote a new wallet.dat, skipping all 'tx' records and any un-serializable or un-decryptable records\n- Re-scanned to recreate transaction history\n- Gave the user a report on whether or not any keys could not be recovered\n\n... although maybe all that would be better implemented as a separate tool or \"re-run bitcoin with the -fixwallet switch.\"\n\nFor a quick-and-dirty fix for yellowcoin, maybe a pair of new command-line args:   -fixwallet=fixedwallet.dat -walletpassphrase=foo  ... that did a read/unencrypt/re-encrypt/write and skipped anything that didn't unserialize or decrypt properly...\n\nAnd \"we\" should generate some nicely corrupted testnet-in-a-box wallets to make sure it works...  (bitcointools should be handy for that).\n",

I went a head and mess around with the revision fixwallet.py you posted on the last site you directed me to.\n\nWith the unmodified version of bitcointools i can see pubkey ..... encrypted ....prikey.....\nWith the modified version I get [Skipping item of type ckey](the ones with the --notxes and additional switches)\n\nThis makes me think that I would need to first remove the decryption from the wallet file in order to send out my coins.  The unmodified version of the bitcointools seem to see the wallet just fine.  I think it's just the matter of using the password I have and decrypt it back to a non-passphrase state.\n\nWorse case scenario, i'll just have to send you my wallet file.\n",
