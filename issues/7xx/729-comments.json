I have no idea how to do that, I have no experience with provably correct specifications/code/etc.\n\nHowever, even if Script (and OP_EVAL) was proven correct, that would not stop me from writing \"++\" when I meant \"+1\".\n\nThe larger issue is \"are the benefits of OP_EVAL (eventually, safer wallets, escrow, etc) worth the risks?\" I think the benefits are large and the risks are manageable, and delaying the rollout by six months would just push almost exactly the same risks six months away.

Maybe we can find an alternative way of getting all this functionality without such a fundamental change as OP_EVAL?  OP_EVAL destroys all sorts of nice properties of the scripting system. As I said before OP_EVAL (probably) makes the language \"in-principle\" Turing complete.  Also miners now have the ability to review the entire script before execution.  These will go away when OP_EVAL is introduced.  This is what I mean by a fundamental change.\n",

This basically has the same net effect except that OP_EVAL transactions need a couple more confirmations before they can be trusted.\n\nThe problem with poor review of other clients/branches can be addressed by largely revamping the download on Bitcoin.org. IMO, Bitcoin.org needs to list 3 categories of clients: \"well-tested for production server deployments\" (currently bitcoind 0.4.x), \"no major problems, safe for everyday users\" (Bitcoin-Qt + bitcoind 0.5.x), \"testing, please help if you can\" (Bitcoin-Qt + bitcoind 0.6.x beta/rc, and MultiBit 0.2.0), and finally \"experimental, it compiled, maybe it works\" (Bitcoin-Qt + bitcoind \"next\"); giving users these options enables them to more easily provide input.\n\nRegarding code coverage testing, I think someone really should look into [LLVM's KLEE](http://klee.llvm.org/) before a bad guy does, since it's pretty much guaranteed to find _some_ bug.\n\nAs far as the code review process in general, I think it is too slow already. Protocol-level changes probably need a lot more review, but high-level ones are stagnating and wasting way too much developer time on rebasing/merging due to the slow rate of merges.\n",

It's possible that in this instance it was not implemented correctly but I think it indicates a lack of resources devoted to testing rather than a more fundamental flaw.\n\nIf you felt strongly that OP_EVAL was undesirable, you should have made a bit more noise before a lot of engineering and political effort was expended traveling down this path.\n\nTaking your words literally, you say that miners won't be able to review the entire script before execution once OP_EVAL is introduced. This is plainly false. I know the change you actually meant and it was mentioned the very first time OP_EVAL was proposed. \nWith OP_EVAL, it becomes practically impossible to work out what sort of script or whether a valid script exists which can redeem the proposed \"standard\" OP_EVAL transactions. I think this is a desirable feature rather than an unfortunate consequence.\n",

On the other hand, new features that don't affect the protocol or implementation thereof, should be included ASAP as soon as the next merge window opens, with at least 1 other developer giving it a look over or numerous users testing and using it. In reality, many of the latter class (non-protocol-related) have been ready to this level and waiting for merging since before 0.5, some even before 0.3.24, and still aren't in git HEAD. The main difference for OP_EVAL is that Gavin is personally behind it. I understand that Gavin et al have a right to pick their priorities, but it does appear to have a bit of an extreme slant in a lot of cases.\n",

      "body" : "Good morning all.\n\n@gavinandresen @ByteCoin: I glanced through that thread a while ago (BTW, extracting the use cases of OP_EVAL from reading that thread is difficult, which is why I expected a summary of uses to be in the BIP) and there seemed to be enough skepticism in that thread and on #bitcoin-dev that I didn't expect the proposal to move forward without  further consideration.  Suddenly I find out from a blog post that OP_EVAL is slated for inclusion in 0.6.  Since I'm not yet convinced OP_EVAL is a good idea, I went browsing through the implementation trying to find an error to stop you guys (since the OP_EVAL proposal isn't even close to documented in the BIP (how does OP_EVAL interact with OP_IF? Does OP_EVAL clear the alt_stack? what is the rational for these design choices (and I suspect the answer is that you guys haven't even considered this and are not even aware you are making design choices)) the only way to find out what the OP_EVAL proposal is is to read the code).  It only took me 70 minutes to find an error.\n\nNow I see this as a serious red flag.  If I can find a bug in 70 minutes, how many other bugs are lurking? Think about it.  (Granted this wasn't as serious as I reported due to the op_code execution limit, but it was still a moderate bug.)\n\n(Also because OP_EVAL doesn't have a detailed specification, I wasn't even sure that the ++ was an error when I first saw it.  Only later after double checking the semantics of post-fix ++ was I sure it was an error.)\n\n@ByteCoin current properties include something like square or cubic space usage in terms of the length of scripts (ignoring the artificial limits imposed by the standard client) and some sort of polynomial bound on time usage that I haven't figured out.  Also right now the miners have the option inspect the script before executing.  They can easily count the number of OP_CHECKSIGS or whatever they want to do.  Tell me, how many OP_CHECKSIGS will be executed in \"OP_1 OP_HASH160 OP_EVAL\"? (In a related note: Personally I would have designed OP_CHECKMULTISIG to statically take m and n in the opcode itself, but nothing can be done about that now.) There may be other nice properties that I haven't even considered.\n\nMaybe it is okay to alter these properties.  Maybe it is right to clear the alt_stack upon OP_EVAL and restore it when done. I don't know.  My concern is that you guys haven't even thought about these issues.  These issues certainly haven't been documented anywhere.\n\nPersonally I think you cannot even give proper consideration to protocol extensions without first given proper consideration to the current protocol by documenting it and its design.  (Did you know that a OP_VERIF will cause a script to fail even if it occurs in a non-executed part of an OP_IF branch?)  And yes, Gavin, I do volunteer to do this and have been slowly working on it in my spare time.\n",

That's why we code review and test, and that's why bitcoin is version zero-point-something.\n\nI think you're losing sight of the big picture:  I want OP_EVAL sooner rather than later exactly BECAUSE bugs happen.  OP_EVAL and the multisignature transactions make it possible to distribute trust (in the form of private keys) between two different devices/implementations, so if one has a horrible bug that lets hackers try to spend your coins they'll be foiled by the signature required on the other.\n\nOn the big picture of Script in general:  I think opcodes that are ill-defined or difficult to reason about should join the list of disabled opcodes; I have no idea why Satoshi kept OP_VERIF.  Longer term, I like the idea of a well-specified little evaluation engine that is easy to reason about and is extremely well-specified, but that will take a long time to get right.  Despite the bugs, I think OP_EVAL is possible to get \"right enough\" in the next month.\n",

But it is processed this way because of this code:\n\n```\n else if (fExec || (OP_IF <= opcode && opcode <= OP_ENDIF))\n```\n\nOP_VERIF is in between OP_IF and OP_ENDIF so it is executed, but since there is no case handler, it fails.\n\nMy point is that this complexity is exactly the reason you need to stop expanding the protocol and figure out what you already have.  Blindly going forward with OP_EVAL when you clearly don't understand the existing protocol yet is simply too risky.  You may cause more problems than you solve.\n",

Gavin's a good project leader and I think it's more productive to support his development vision than to second guess it and throw sand in the gears. \n\nBy far the biggest systemic risk to Bitcoin is the possibility Gavin might leave. If you disagree with him then your ultimate sanction is to leave. The weight of your opinion is likely to be proportional to the amount that you help with the project and make Gavin's life easier. If you help out then Gavin's incentivized to keep you happy or else he loses your development effort when you leave. If you want your opinion taken more seriously and have more influence in the development direction I suggest you work together. Do some work you don't particularly want to do or find interesting so that it doesn't have to be done by someone else.\n\nI've read Gavin's implementation of OP_EVAL. He didn't do it in the way I would have done it but HE DID IT. I didn't. Similarly with large parts of the existing client and protocol. It's rubbish but it exists and works. You can criticize it but it's not very productive unless you're prepared to help.\n\nYou raise some valid points but I'll be much more impressed if you follow up. You say \"these issues haven't been documented anywhere\". Document them yourself (in the wiki?) You say \"you guys haven't even thought about these issues\". Ok you have (a few months too late but never mind). Perhaps we have and didn't bother documenting it, perhaps we didn't.\n\nI think it's unlikely that OP_EVAL developmet will come to a grinding halt based on your concerns. Your disapproval signals a lack of appreciation for the work that has been done and is demoralizing. It's easy to find something to criticize about someone else's code. Why not be more supportive? Aren't we all working towards the same ultimate goal?\n\nByteCoin\n\nPS. Thanks for finding the bug.\n",

With the implementation things should be much faster in current bitcoin. 6 months is nicer than 3 for this :)\n\nHowever, that's just my preference. Whoever writes the code kind of gets the say. And there's enough intelligent people discussing this on here, the forums, mailing lists, IRC and email that I trust the people involved to get it right :)\n\nWe are at a momentous exciting time for bitcoin, and there are going to be contentious issues moving forwards. We must not squander this repository of raw potential by excessively stalling. Always throughout history when moving forwards there were those who would have rather have stayed at home but had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the future.\n",
