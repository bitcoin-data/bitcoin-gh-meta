I'm not sure what you mean by custom tailored, unless you're talking about our depends system? However in that case, it's \"tailored\" to serve a specific purpose.\r\n\r\n> Improve ecosystem by having option to build shared libraries\r\n> if i wanted to instead wrap around the C++ code using CFFI and call directly from Python/JS/Whatever I am unable to as where would I even begin to get started on compiling a library as opposed to the executable in a neat manner\r\n\r\nThe current build system can and does build shared libraries. i.e libconsensus. There is a large amount of discussion related to libconsensus in this repository. There are also some PRs that demonstrate integration with other languages, including Rust.\r\n\r\n> When developing, the sanitizers can be added\r\n> Proper sanitizing and bug catching\r\n\r\nOur build system currently has support for debugging/sanitizers/fuzzers etc and they are run as part of our CI. We also have some getting started type documentation for new contributors, i.e https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/fuzzing.md. Is there a particular feature or support for a tool that you think is missing?\r\n\r\n> For instance, I found a buffer overflow in the tests within the ctaes library (inside crypto)\r\n\r\nGreat. Have you reported this upstream anywhere? See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/SECURITY.md.\r\n\r\nIn any case, you're likely to get more interest if you actually present a branch with all the changes required, as they are going to be substantial, involve multiple sub projects, third-party libraries, compilers, build tools etc. For what it's worth I'm still Concept NACK.",

You could use gitsubmodules or subtrees to help with this or just make the CMake scripts flexible enough to build different versions of bitcoin.\r\n\r\nThe people who actually devote time and effort to maintaining the bitcoin build system already have many issues to deal with and lots of work to do (supporting reproducible builds, packaging and signing, minimizing dependencies) and don't have a huge amount of experience with CMake. It would be unrealistic to expect them to learn how to use and maintain a CMake build.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have a lot of experience with CMake and think it's much nicer than autotools. But I don't maintain the bitcoin build system, and I am glad if the people who do maintain the build system use the tools they're most knowledgeable about.",

This isn't some \"fad\" its many years in the making, I've already noted that notable projects like LLVM are making use of it. I agree that a stable project like this one shouldn't chase after shiny new objects, but this isn't one. If you can follow that reddit poll of preferred build systems, it appears that Makefiles doesnt do \"as bad\", its because there weren't more options. CMake got nearly 4x what Makefiles did.\r\n\r\nNow there are times when a good idea/project are unknown and secret to most of the world, Bitcoin is one of them. Then there are the things everyone knows about and is fully valued, like Makefiles which are being replaced by a better product, like CMake or Meson and others.\r\n\r\n",

But still falls short. I guess I wasn't very clear in the main post that easier onboarding and use of newer tools would be a positive side effect of implementing CMake. I didn't mean to say that this project should use CMake to have access to IDEs. Thats just a cherry on top.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of places where the code does some checking for X environment or Y library.

Bitcoin is an example of a good outcome amongst the many dead failed attempts to create a decentralized money system. Had you said those exact words right up to the end of 2008/early 2009 you would have been 100% correct.\r\n\r\nI don't get the impression that you've a lot of experience working with this software, there is simply no value to attempting to use Bitcoin in this manor, there is no use case which comes close to justifying doing this.
