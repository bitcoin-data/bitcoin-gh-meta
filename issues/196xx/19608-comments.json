The intermediate transactions in my use case aren't actually valid, because they contain imbalanced inputs/outputs (e.g. the outputs might sum to more than the inputs), so they can't just be broadcasted to the network.  But, if I understand you correctly, you're saying that in terms of serialization/deserialization, they look exactly like valid transactions, thus we can treat them as complete, valid transactions for the purpose of transferring them between the users, and there's no need to use the PSBT serialization?",
