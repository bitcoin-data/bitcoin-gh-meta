   "body" : "We currently have two structures for per-peer data:\r\n\r\n- `CNode` in net, which should just contain connection layer data (eg socket, send/recv buffers, etc), but currently also contains some application layer data (eg tx/block inventory).\r\n- `CNodeState` in net processing, which contains p2p application layer data, but requires cs_main to be locked for access.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a third struct `Peer`, which is for p2p application layer data, and doesn't require cs_main. Eventually all application layer data from `CNode` should be moved to `Peer`, and any data that doesn't strictly require cs_main should be moved from `CNodeState` to `Peer` (probably all of `CNodeState` eventually).\r\n\r\n`Peer` objects are stored as shared pointers in a net processing global map `g_peer_map`, which is protected by `g_peer_mutex`. To use a `Peer` object, `g_peer_mutex` is locked, a copy of the shared pointer is taken, and the lock is released. Individual members of `Peer` are protected by different mutexes that guard related data. The lifetime of the `Peer` object is managed by the shared_ptr refcount.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the `Peer` object and moves the misbehaving data from `CNodeState` to `Peer`. This allows us to immediately remove 15 `LOCK(cs_main)` instances.\r\n\r\nFor more motivation see #19398",
