   "body" : "This uses the first 4 commits of #15045, rebased and added some comments. The diff is quite large already and I want to make it easy to review, so I'm splitting it into 2 PRs (transaction and script). Script one is WIP, I'll link it when I open it.\r\n\r\nInterpretation of scripts is dependent on the script verification flags passed in.\r\nIn tests, we should always apply **maximal** verification flags when checking that a transaction is **valid**; any additional flags should invalidate the transaction. A transaction should not be valid because we forgot to include a flag, and we should apply all flags by default.\r\nWe should apply **minimal** verification flags when asserting that a transaction is **invalid**; if verification flags are applied, removing any one of them should mean the transaction is valid.\r\nNew verify flags must be backwards compatible; tests should check backwards compatibility and apply the new flags by default. All `tx_invalid` tests should continue to be invalid with the exact same verify flags. All `tx_valid` tests that don't pass with new flags should _explicitly_ indicate that the flags need to be excluded, and fail otherwise.\r\n\r\n1. Flip the meaning of `verifyFlags` in tx_valid.json to mean _excluded_ verification flags instead of included flags. Edit the test data accordingly.\r\n2. Trim unneeded flags from tx_invalid.json.\r\n3. Add check to verify that tx_valid tests have maximal flags and tx_invalid tests have minimal flags.\r\n4. Add checks to verify that flags are soft forks (#10699) i.e. adding any flag should only decrease the number of acceptable scripts. Test by adding/removing random flags.",
