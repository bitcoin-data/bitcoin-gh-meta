   "body" : "As it stands, `RecordBytesSent` is called twice, once under the `cs_vSend` lock, and once not.  This PR moves both calls out of the lock.\r\n\r\nIn doing this, I've made a change to SocketSendData.  Before, it required the caller to lock `cs_vSend`, now it locks `cs_vSend` itself.  The only case where this makes a difference is when performing an optimistic write (where MessageHandler is the thread that calls SocketSendData, not SocketHandler).  As justified in the commit message, I don't think this will cause any problems, and subjectively I think this is an improvement to how we're using the locks.  I'm more than happy to be told that I'm wrong :)\r\n\r\nAdditionally this PR brings PushMessage into line with the style guide, and does verious other cleanups.\r\n\r\nThis PR was originally related to #18784 but it now stands on its own.",
