   "body" : "#19439 was recently merged and seemed to work fine but I now noticed strange behavior when it was running in Travis, which I could not reproduce locally. It turns out `TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE` which is used in Travis to get the commits for the linter, uses all the commits that were in a push, which includes all rebase commits for example. This means that the linter can fail on a commit that the developer has never even seen before, which can be very confusing. See an example here which caused me to look into this: https://travis-ci.org/github/bitcoin/bitcoin/jobs/714296381 The commit that is reported as failing in my PR is not part of my PR.\r\n\r\nI think we rather want to use something like `git merge-base` to get the commit range by default and in Travis. I am leaving the env variable functionality in place with a different name but this is not a variable that can be expected to be present in the CI environments so the `merge-base` range should be used there by default.",
