This seemed fine at first, but I started looking into that a bit more deeply and I think if we want to retain all of the same behavior, it doesn't quite work. The issue is the option to keep transaction metadata. This works by keeping the removed txs in a temp variable and restoring the metadata for the txs found during the rescan. However moving this to the wallet tool means that we will lose this behavior as that metadata will be lost and the wallet tool cannot do the rescan.",

Wallet tool could do the equivalent of current zap command line option but instead of stashing metadata in a temporary variable, stash it in temporary rows. So the offline part of zap would clear [`BESTBLOCK`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4b705b1c98f60ab736df98d62a8d4988f61678d5/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L26) and rename [`TX`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4b705b1c98f60ab736df98d62a8d4988f61678d5/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L43) rows to `ZAPTX` rows. Then the rescan would scavenge and clear the `ZAPTX` rows.\r\n",
