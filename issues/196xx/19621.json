See my update on #14895 to advance discussions on package-relay.**\r\n\r\nFew design choices of interest:\r\n* introduce new p2p messages, `sendpackages`, `MSG_PACKAGE`, `package` and new `package_id` identifier incorporated to the INV/GETDATA control logic : https://gist.github.com/ariard/10924249b3b7f6e239d80895372839b8\r\n* add a new `sendpackage` rpc to let a higher-application signals a chain of transactions and such start a propagation on the p2p network\r\n* integrate a `PackageCache` to internally cache the mapping package_id -> txids/wtxids, as they need to be persistent across a round-trip between upstream/downstream peers, it must be DoS resistant\r\n*  build on #16401 `AcceptMultipleTransactions` with a package policy restriction to 2-tx only, make it easier to reason on for replacement\r\n* allow for package replacement based on newer feerate higher that the union of feerate of all transactions conflicted, no dedup for now between conflicted set\r\n* don't redundantly send a transaction via INV(MSG_TX) if we know an associated package and peer signal package relay support\r\n* TODO: integrate package_id with overhaul transaction request/AlreadyHave to save further on bandwidth\r\n\r\n(anyway I expect any production-ready package-relay implem to go after wtxid follow-ups/overhaul transaction request/Erlay the p2p pipeline is already enough congested it's mostly to advance the conceptual conversation in the meanwhile)",
