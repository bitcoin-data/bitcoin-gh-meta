Not sure if it is an (upstream) bug or expected behavior. I thought about adding a check that LOAD ranges with different permissions don't overlap on the same memory pages, but this is a clear violation of this, making the separation less effective.\r\n\r\n> (in any case, not a reason to not move forward with this as it is, better is better)\r\n\r\n> Edit: it does seem to work out locally, maybe I just miscounted? I've added a per-page permission check in this commit: https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin/commit/9d9fcefcaec3d638f472ea77c146eaec8f9079c1\r\n\r\nIt may also be the case that this is expected, and we just need to confirm that.",
