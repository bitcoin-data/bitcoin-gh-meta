   "body" : "I was thinking, since it looks like the testnet is very hard to mine and has already had many halvings (I know they are faster). What are your thoughts on a testnet reset for the next release of Bitcoin Core? The testnet I believe should get a refresher as it's been many years since the launch of testnet3 and many altcoins are on testnet4. If you all like this, I'll submit a PR to reset the testnet.",
