That's likely to hurt more than help. In this case, qt build\nfailed, and on the second attempt, it appeared to be successful. However, due\nto a bad object from an internal gcc error on the first build, the resulting\nlib was unusable. This caused bitcoin-qt to not be built, and tests and\npackaging which expected bitcoin-qt to be there failed.\n\nThe root cause:\nMingw is especially crashy when using -jX, likely compounded by low-memory\nenvironments. I've seen multiple problems with this combo in Gitian as well.\n\nIn this case:\ni686-w64-mingw32-g++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)\n...\nmake[3]: **\\* [.obj/release/qdrawhelper.o] Error 4\n\nThe workaround:\nBump Travis down to using -j2 by default. Additionaly, enable --with-gui for\nthe windows builds. This will cause configure to fail if qt is not working\nwhile also testing the config flag.\n\nOther failures which may be worth revisiting separately:\n- If a depends package fails, maybe remove the workdir so that it doesn't taint\n  subsequent runs\n- See if there's anything repeatable about the ICE when building qt\n",
