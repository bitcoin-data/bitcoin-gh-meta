With in-wallet export, this need <20 minutes. If this new python script are same fast, that's good. :)\n\nThe second reason, is more complex: many altcoin are based on your codebase. they may have multihashing algo or new fields on blocks/transactions etc. This new stuff are good handled on code (readblockfromdisk, writeblocktodisk). But this altcoins cannot use your linearize script, because they have to port they changes into the script. Maybe that's hard or impossible. With in-wallet export, they doesnt need this.\n",
