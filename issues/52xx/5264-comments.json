I was back and forth on that before I pushed it up, so I'm happy for your opinions.\r\n\r\nI can see @petertodd's concern about this being a breaking change for people scripted against it. It's something to weigh. I don't know that adding more flags is the answer. From working on another pull request, my understanding is that the JSON is equivalent to \"verbose\".\r\n\r\nFWIW, I kind of like the extra decoding output myself because it's one less thing I have to think about. It's a simple decode like @petertodd said, but having it just there in plain sight means I don't have to remember, or go look it up.\r\n\r\nI will add some release notes comments in doc/release-notes.md in a little bit after waiting to hear what other feedback is.",

I would have normally assumed some annotation on the asm output, or an additional lower level asm view.\r\n\r\nMy goal was mostly that it would be clearly indicated in some manner stronger than squnting at bytes. In particular, squinting fails when you only barely know there is something you need to squint at. An expliact flag list would be much more obvious and discoverable.\r\n\r\nWRT compatiblity of the ASM output, we've certantly never promised to hold that encoding constant... it's fine if things are reading it, but they'll need to be revised if it changes.",

Also, if changing stuff like that *doesn't* break any tests, keep in mind it's a sign that maybe depending on the exact format of the asm output is a bad idea. :)\r\n\r\n(yeah, the more I think about this, the more I think my original objection was wrong...)",

Right now, that logic is in the interpreter.\r\n\r\nI spent some time looking at the layering.\r\n\r\nI think IsValidSignatureEncoding could be moved over to script/bitcoinconsensus.cpp since it is entirely consensus-critical since BIP66.\r\n\r\nSince the sig hash type is not part of consensus, only part of determining if a sig is standard, I think move IsDefinedHashtypeSignature and the sig hash types over to script/standard.cpp and .h respectively.\r\n\r\nIsLowDERSignature is effectively dead code.\r\n\r\nThen, CheckSignatureEncoding could also go to script/standard.cpp since it's not consensus and does not seem like it could only ever be used by the interpreter.\r\n\r\nI think at that point the layering concern is covered.\r\n\r\nNext, what lead to the klutziness in my code, that I wound up not really liking, was the need to answer the question of if the current script was a scriptSig. A lot of what I did to ValueString was to avoid mis-interpreting non-scriptSig data as a signature.\r\n\r\nIt seems like a flag could be set on the script object, or more object oriented, just use a SignatureScript type object when these objects are created (and PubKeyScript objects in other cases). Then this decode ticket would be an override to SignatureScript::ToString.\r\n\r\nBut, refactoring all that would obscure this change and is a lot of work for this seemingly low-value sighash decode. It'd turn into a train of refactoring tickets followed by the last ticket to actually do the simple decode. There's also probably a reason why all that refactoring would be misguided or error-prone that I don't foresee yet.\r\n\r\nAll my hacking to avoid refactoring is what makes me think this should just be closed.\r\n\r\nAlso, TxToUniv is only used by bitcoin-tx, CScript::ToString is the common dependency of RPC and bitcoin-tx.\r\nThe RPC dependencies go through, TxToJSON (decoderawtransaction and getrawtransaction) and ScriptPubKeyToJSON (decodescript).\r\nThat reason, and thinking that a script should know how to show/display/decode itself, is why I targeted CScript::ToString as the place to make these changes.",

I was just thinking that determining whether a signature is validly encoded is generic enough that it could be useful without including the interpreter. Personal preference, I guess.\r\n\r\n> The sighash types and CheckSignatureEncoding are definitely part of consensus (and are used by the interpreter), please, just leave them there.\r\n\r\nI was assuming that to begin with, but IsDefinedHashtypeSignature is only called when the flags include SCRIPT_VERIFY_STRICTENC. The comment for SCRIPT_VERIFY_STRICTENC even states, \"not used or intended as a consensus rule\". The best I found was that scripts with a bad sighash type would fail to eval (and thus be non-standard), but that if they got into valid blocks we'd still have to accept those blocks. I suppose I could try it and see, but that's what made me say that the sig hash type is not actually part of consensus. Maybe we're using the word consensus in two different ways here.\r\n\r\n> The only thing you need to move is the new code for converting to string to script/standard and I think all layering concerns are gone.\r\n\r\nOh, you mean move ValueString and mapSigHashTypes over to script/standard and add the CScript as an argument to ValueString? Yes, that may make sense. And, if we move the sighash stuff from interpreter over to standard, then it'll all be in the same place.",

But better is better, so my only requirement for an utACK is what I said before: equal or less code in libconsensus (and less is better).\r\n\r\nEDIT: So, to be completely clear. It's not your fault that CScript::ToString() is in libconsensus, we just don't want you to make it worse by improving the method/function in-place.",

I took that and actually refactored these changes twice.\r\n\r\nI put each of the two ways into the last two commits.\r\n\r\nThe first commit refactored into a couple of formatter classes. It worked, but the second/next idea seemed a little cleaner.\r\n\r\nThe second commit does away with the formatter class idea of the previous commit and just moves CScript::ToString out into a function in core_write.cpp.\r\n\r\nI think this last commit converges your input with sipa's input. I think the last one loops in everyone's input, doesn't layer violate, and reduces code from the consensus library.\r\n\r\nI purposefully didn't choose to sighhash decode some scriptSigs that were just going to be logged since those usages were tangential to what i was trying to actually update for this ticket.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think of the latest.

The important thing is this: independently of where you chose to put the new code outside of libconsensus, you cannot include that new code from libconsensus. That's why I keep posting a link to the list of files that are part of libconsensus: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/Makefile.am#L365\r\nIf you include more things in any of those files, travis will complain (unless you adapt the makefile properly to include the new file, in which case we will complain).\r\n\r\nSo, either don't adapt CTransaction::ToScript to the new code (seems the simpler solution) or also take CTransaction::ToString out of consensus (seems better but also more work).
