   "body" : "I'm simply an advanced user who speaks for the scalability hard fork.\n\nSo, I am sure you know the psychological difference between a 0.10 version and 0.9 version.\nThey can be seen as 0.1 and 0.0.9 versions by users.\n\nAnd only a 0.20 (0.2) version can reproduce this effect.\n\nThe problem is the time that separates these two versions:\n- If it is too short, version 0.20 will be less quickly adapted by users than 0.10 version.\n- If it is too long (6 months or more), the hard fork can be an emergency measure.\n\nFrom this fact, and allowing users to update within 3 months, why not hard fork with 0.10 ?\n\nAs an example, we can note the hard fork of Dogecoin (1.8):\n\nDogecoin has 4 times less nodes than Bitcoin, but within 3 weeks, more than 50% of nodes have update, without the media exposure of Bitcoin.\n\n3 months for update, it seems very correct.\n\nWhat's the plan for it?\n",
