We have people selling insane data storage services, etc.  It's a bad place to be.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, many of the externalized cost creating services which could use op_return (e.g. data they're encoding is small) still don't bother.  Rather than a success, I think it's hard to say that it hasn't been much of a success.  Though: at least a few things that were going to encode data did switch to hashes, so I think the limitations were at least somewhat informative.\r\n\r\nThat said, there are some cases where I think more data can make sense and be useful.  For example, I think of the ECDH address negoiation stuff isn't a terrible use... a bit inefficient compared to using an external system, but not unreasonable... and that application wants the ability to push in additional payment identifiers and the like (see petertodd's latest update to the stealth address additions).\r\n\r\nSo, I'd prefer to make any increase take the form of allowing more pushes, e.g. you can have up to {limit} bytes, in the form of pushes up to 40 bytes. Beyond furthering the message that this isn't an endorcement for externalizing your storage and transmission costs to the increasingly shrinking public network that our decenteralization depends on; this option also is permissive enough that there isn't a {well you can use checkmultsig instead} that is more permissive.\r\n\r\nIf people who would support this would also support that, I'll submit a PR.",

This is also the reason why I created the chart - which might not be 100 % accurate, but close to. One can start to make assumptions about miners who don't \"respect\" the dust rule, but this is difficult to messure and there are a few other aspects as well, e.g.:\r\n\r\n- miners who block bare multisig\r\n- miners who don't mine OP_RETURN\r\n\r\nMy previous tests showed (with sample sizes of less than thousand transactions) the acceptance of OP_RETURN increased significantly over the year, but bare multisig is still faster.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line:\r\n\r\nThose additional factors support an increase in size, whether it's based on the assumption that it's more profitable to ignore the dust rule, to create unspent outputs or to include the fact that not every miner mines data transactions.\r\n\r\nIt can further be determined that the size should be *at least* 80 byte to stay competitive against other  data embedding mechanisms.",

If people feel your authority is undermining their products, eventually they will subvert that and it only takes 1 miner to disagree.

Network behavior is one of the few bits of friction driving good technical design rather than \"move fast, break things, and force everyone else onto my way of doing thing rather than discussing the design in public\".   No one wants to be an outright gatekeeper, but the network is a shared resource and it's perfectly reasonable node behavior to be stingy about the perpetual storage impact of the transactions they're willing to process, especially when it comes to neutral technical criteria like the amount of network irrelevant data stuffed in transactions.\r\n\r\nThere is also a very clear pattern we've seen in the past where people take anything the system lets them do as strong evidence that they have a irrevocable right to use the system in that way, and that their only responsibility-- and if their usage harms the system it's the responsibility of the system to not permit it. This is especially concerning since external data that isn't necessary for the operation of the system comes with a liability that people may try ordering nodes or miners to censor the data (e.g. when it's being used as a botnet control channel acting as a high bandwidth channel for \"illegal information\"). For mitigating these risks it's optimal if transactions seem as uniform and indistinguishable as reasonably possible.",

The alternative, making bare multisig non-standard as proposed by Luke, may lead to even more harmful results, namely switching back to the creation of non-redeemable outputs, which is also cheaper in terms of effective transaction size/payload size for larger payloads.",

      "body" : "@dexX7 those are good points but imagine we do both: make bare multisig non-standard and change MAX_OP_RETURN_RELAY from 40 to 80 or 999999. Maybe we can also have different default constants for relay and mining. \r\nWill that make standard policy discussions end?\r\nI don't think so. That's why I prefer to focus on making policy code behavior more easily configurable rather than dedicate an unbound amount of time to get to the \"objectively best policy\", which we know doesn't exist. \r\nPeople have to be aware that the standard policy is conservative, probably over-conservative; and deal with it by having their own policies. Having a standard policy being too permissive kind of defeats the purpose of having a standard policy in the first place.\r\nSo I think I agree with @luke-jr there (but I will rephrase it): if having parts of the standard policy that people who care about policy don't like, and that causes people who care about policies implement or configure their own policies....maybe it is good to have \"unpopular\" things on the standard policy.\r\n\r\n@genjix I don't know about @gmaxwell's solution but the maximum number of OP_RETURN outputs in the standard policy can be made configurable too.\r\n\r\nI'd just rather not create more policy-specific command-line options until the policy code is isolated. \r\nI wish people had less time for discussing the \"correct\" standard policy and more time to review and ack a trivial PRs like #5696 (sorry for linking that again, but it just comes to mind every time I comment on anything related to policy).\r\n",

It's probably only a matter of time until more libraries such as [blockpop](https://github.com/petertodd/blockpop) or [Stone](https://github.com/dasmithii/Stone) appear, which abstract data storage and decouple data from the underlying transport layer, which is likely going to be chosen based on metrics such as transaction costs and miner adoption.\r\n\r\nI have very mixed feelings about it in general, but getting the inceives right and minimize disadvantages of cost per payload and a slightly higher confirmation delay of using `OP_RETURN` compared to alternatives seems reasonable.",

Allowing them to move to `OP_RETURN` encoding sooner is better for everyone. \r\n\r\nHaving this go into 0.10 now would mean the eco system moves to relaying 80 opreturns faster than if we wait for `0.11` which might be 6 months away. Let's face it, wide deployment of a new version takes considerable time after release, so sooner is better for everyone. Given that the change is uncontroversial technically speaking, I personally think it should go into 0.10 now.\r\n\r\n@petertodd I didn't create a PR for this because it's a straightforward cherry-pick, and since all merges are done manually anyhow, it doesn't create any more or less work for the maintainers to pull.\r\n",
