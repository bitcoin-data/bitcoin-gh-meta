And to make any such significant changes requires everyone _everyone_ to agree, as indeed, there is a fear of a fork. Shouldn't we be? Every coin that existed before the fork can then be spent twice. That breaks the entire purpose of Bitcoin's existence.\n\nFurthermore, some changes may be wanted by some group of users, but not others. The system has the rules that people accepted and have invested in for years now. You can't just change those from under them. In case there is no overwhelming consensus that a particular change is needed, you just can't make it. The inter-block time is certainly one of those things that would be very controversial to change.\n\nIf you're actually interested in proposing such changes, please do so on the mailing list. This is just one project, and the maintainers of one piece of software shouldn't be in charge of making system-level changes. You need support from everyone using it.\n",
