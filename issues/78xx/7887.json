   "body" : "This refactor is part of larger work I'm doing for faster\nblock relay. It was inspired by noticing that mapBlockSource\nis redundant with mapBlocksInFlight -- mapBlocksInFlight already\ncontains a mapping from blockhash to peer id.\n\nmapBlockSource was used to DoS-ban peers that send us bad blocks,\nbut the banning logic was sometimes broken-- InvalidBlockFound\ncould DoS ban, and then another ban for the same bad block would\nbe applied in ProcessMessages. Just removing mapBlockSource is\nthe simplest fix.\n\nThere is a corner case where a peer might have been banned before,\nbut will not get banned now: if we get an out-of-order block\nfrom a peer that double-spends an output spent in a previous block\nthat we don't yet have. The requirement that the block have valid\nproof-of-work prevents this from being a practical DoS attack.\n\nProcessNewBlock loses it's *pfrom argument, which is nice--\nProcessNewBlock shouldn't care about networking stuff.\n",
