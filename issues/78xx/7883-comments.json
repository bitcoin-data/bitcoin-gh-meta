Or maybe just hand-pick a few representative ones.\n\nThe CCoinsView/CCoinsViewDB ones aren't too difficult. It's easy to create a temporary in-memory database (some other tests do this) and get and put values into it. Some database benchmarks could be very straightforward. Replicating the actual usage patterns of the client is hard though, many times micro-benchmarks of the database showed completely different characteristics than e.g. reindex timings. But that's not a requirement of every benchmark.\n\nBasic mempool benchmarks shouldn't be too hard either. Just keep pushing transactions into it and see what e.g. the performance of eviction is.\n\nScript validation is also quite straightforward.\n",
