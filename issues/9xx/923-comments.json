If you don't have the time or background to keep up with it and understand it deeply you should probably limit your exposure.\n\nIn any case, I'm glad your issue was resolved. Cheers.\n",

I think I understood your question to mean \"could someone have stolen my bitcoins as a result of continuing to use 0.6.0rc1\", right? The answer is practically, no, as sipa implied but didn't expressly state. Even had there been a fork that your client followed, it wouldn't have been the main fork, and even if you'd spend your coins on that fork, they would still exist on the main fork. If anything, you'd have ended up with 50k coins on both forks, and could have double spent them had anyone else continued following and mining that other fork (which they didn't). I think I'm right in this conclusion. Hopefully someone will correct me if I'm not.\n",
