      "body" : "1. #986 is a dead-simple patch which solves a known and well-documented issue in boost::interprocesses.  What it does is clear and simple and there is no reason to avoid it.\n2. This one has been discussed over and over again (we've had one pull request or another sitting around getting slow discussion about the possibility of attackers hitting bitcoin with URIs since before 0.4).  At this point, I have yet to hear anything remotely convincing that could indicate an attacker could do anything remotely useful to attack this.  \n3. We already have to have a significant amount of time dedicated to 0.6rc5 testing before we can release, blocking URI handling on windows for 0.6 is really not the way to go.  It is a very simple feature with one very minor bug (which manifests itself in several ugly ways).  If there are still issues after #986 is merged in 0.6rc5, then yea Id say disable it until 0.7.\n4.  I really, really believe URI support is a very important usability feature (much more important than P2SH or many of the other things we've spent serious time implementing).  It offers users a much, much more user-friendly way of making payto links and gives a much more professional and clean feeling to paying online merchants (which is one of the biggest use-cases for bitcoin today).\n",

I have strong reservations about bitcoin: URIs, especially given the recent report of Javascript-based bitcoin address rewriting trojans.

Just because its \"hacky\" doesnt mean its bad nor is it a reason to avoid it.\n2. It was very thoroughly tested aside from the ipc issues (which only cropped up in bitcoin-qt, and were not there using the same code in wx).  \n3. Not really adding anything, because its already there, been tested on Linux/Windows, just caused a few bugs on Windows, which were found thanks to it being tested.  \n4. Yes, js trojans can just as easily rewrite URIs as addresses, but what is the difference?  It doesnt change the security but makes it easier to pay... \n   As for how we confirm we are paying who we think we are, any sane merchant should be using SSL and sane xss protection, which all but removes any threat of js trojans (aside from browser plugins hijacking stuff).  If you want to try to block that, you can try to use aliases like the old https requests but that only moderately helps.  Any trojan can go and get its nice paypal.com domain with Cyrillic a's and then you are equally as screwed... This gets into the rat race issue very, very quickly...\n\nThe setup.nsi issue is an artifact of how old this stuff really is.  Its been around forever, and so many people have seen it/looked over it/written it that I completely disagree with the assumption that it is untested.  It was written by luke, rewritten by me, commented on by laanjw, gmaxwell, etc, etc.  And has been in 0.6 since rc1.\n",
