It works sometimes, but mostly it just leaves the spinning orange circle icon showing.\n\nIt turns out that typically, count is 175517 and nTotalBlocks is 168000.\n\nnTotalBlocks is from GetNumBlocksOfPeers() in main.cpp:\n  return std::max(cPeerBlockCounts.median(), Checkpoints::GetTotalBlocksEstimate());\n\nand cPeerBlockCounts has 2 values in it when we check, the initial 0 and 175517 from the first peer we connected to.  The median of these two is 87758 and so max() returns the highest checkpoint: 168000\n\nI can modify the code to ignore the initial 0 in the vector, but that doesn't help with the other problems:\n\nEven as new connections come in and fill the (5 slot) cPeerBlockCounts vector, the spinner icon keeps spinning.  It will only be changed when setNumBlocks() is run again, which is only triggered by a numBlocksChanged signal.  This also causes the tooltip on the checkmark to say things like \"last received block was generated 3 minutes ago\" for 10 minutes at a time.  The \"3 minutes ago\" is generated once, and not updated as the newest block ages.\n\nSometimes when I run bitcoin-qt we have 2 connections before the median is checked, and in that case the green check mark appears correctly because the median of [0, correct, correct] is correct.\n\nWhen a new block is generated my client gets it pretty quickly, but the vector used to calculate nTotalBlocks is only updated when we first connect to each peer, and so doesn't reflect the new blockchain length:\n\n```\nSetBestChain: new best=0000000000000226709b  height=175523  work=292688024487397697436\nblock counts: [ 140700 175522 175522 175522 175522 ] median 175522, max 175522\n```\n\nand so the icon goes back to the orange spinner.\n",

See my comment 2 up from this one for details of why that happens.\n\nEven if we fix the median code to ignore the 0 value, there's still a problem if the first peer we connect to is still downloading the blockchain.  We'll set nTotalBlocks to the number of blocks that peer has, see that we have more, and so show the green checkmark.\n",

The progress bar is only shown when count < nTotalBlocks.\n\nSo the proposed change will mean they are never shown at the same time.\n\nWe use the last checkpoint as initial estimation of the total number of blocks, but this will quickly change as soon as some connections are made. That's on purpose, nTotalBlocks is always going to be lagging with the current protocol.\n",
