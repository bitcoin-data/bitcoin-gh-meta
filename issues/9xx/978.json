   "body" : "I just received a payout from Eligius, and it isn't visible in Bitcoin-Qt despite having 14 confirmations now. My client is up to date, and debug.log shows one entry with the txid. I don't know if it's the same bug, but I have seen the same thing happen with normal (ie, non-generated) sends as well in the past. I have not restarted my client, as I wish to debug this issue. I know it will show up if I use -rescan, at least. What can I try to do to look into this further?\n\n```\n  got inventory: block 0000000000000635c404  new (from 78.47.187.252:8333 at lld)\naskfor block 0000000000000635c404   0\nsending getdata: block
