In this case add code signing to gitian.\n\nThis is harder than it seems, as the determinism verification would have to ignore the developer specific signature...\n\nAlso this will mean that the outer installer can no longer be checked with the trusted build process, as it includes an executable signed with the developer's key so it will always differ. Overall, this may make everything less secure instead of more secure.\n",
