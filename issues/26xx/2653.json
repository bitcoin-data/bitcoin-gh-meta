This is doing to all the discussion about how reliable and tamper proof\nit is. I was believed only after finding my computer free of any indication.\n\nIf my computer is for my interest it would not permit connection to blockchain!!!!\nConnecting to this treacherous thing does me no benefit!\n\nI know others can connect and false claim my address but they should be\nstopped too and can be when they make those words public. The problem is\nmaking of it public because then ignorant people will see and accuse!\n\nIf you fear shutting down the service you should not because it is\nbad and causes great harm to people. But if you must protect it then\nmake the blocking only active if the software has made transactions\nthen blockchain can stay connected but only via wallets with no\ntransactions which can easily be seen to have no indication.\n",
