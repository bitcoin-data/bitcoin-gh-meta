This probably isn't in the best interests of the Bitcoin protocol, since it benefits from large numbers of nodes remaining online, to provide stability and scalability.\r\n\r\nHas such a thing happened in court before, if not from Bitcoin, then from another similar peer-to-peer protocol?  If something illegal is relayed through you, without your knowledge, and the audit trail ends at you and can't be traced back further, then, are you legally then responsible for it?  If so, that would be a rather chilling effect for many other network services, not just Bitcoin.  Are you in the USA?  If so, that's very unfortunate, our legal/political climate is not the most welcoming to users of new/disruptive technologies....\r\n\r\nThe blockchain.info service is merely a collector of information that's flowing across the Bitcoin network, and while it doesn't connect to all nodes, it connects to many of them.  Probably the criminal transaction happened at a node that was near to you, but not connected to blockchain.info, and it propagated throughout the Bitcoin network, and your node happened to have the bad luck of being the first node visible to blockchain.info that the transaction passed through, so it looked like it was originated by you.  Anybody could gather this information and set up a similar website to blockchain.info, there's nothing unique to them (although they are very good at what they do), so blocking just this one site wouldn't do anything to help.\r\n\r\nWhat was the outcome of this, did you get help, did you find a competent lawyer?\r\n",

For each incoming transaction that is received for the first time, log the IPv4 address/port (or equivalent for other protocols), along with a timestamp, for that TXID.  Keep this log indefinitely.  The idea would be to be able to provide an audit trail, upon demand, that leads away from your computer.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in the USA, peer-to-peer networks, insecure Wi-Fi networks, etc. are usually \"busted\" hop by hop, and if you fail to provide another hop back in the audit trail, then law enforcement assumes YOU are the end of the line, and prosecutes YOU for whatever crime they are fishing for.  This provides motivation for everybody to either not let their services be used by the public (bad), or keep records allowing for an audit trail to deflect the heat away from them (good).\r\n\r\nWould this be feasible to add to bitcoind and/or Bitcoin-Qt?  Implementation seems reasonable.\r\n",
