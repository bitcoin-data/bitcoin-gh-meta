Among many other modifications, the hashtype is indeed appended to a transaction before computing the hash being signed, but this hashtype field is not part of the transaction itself. There are other modifications made, like clearing the other inputs of a transaction, and replacing the input script being signed with the output script being redeemed.\n\nJust to be clear, sendrawtransaction/createrawtransaction/... take transactions. The modifications made to compute the hash being signed are done on-the-fly when necessary (they are different for the different inputs, for example, so you can't provide a single intermediate form anyway).\n",
