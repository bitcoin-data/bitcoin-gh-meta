When a call to getblocktemplate or other RPC functions scaling in o(nb_tx) or worse is done, use the precomputed structure instead of the available tx. When a new block is known update the structure right away and/or swap with a temporary \"quick to compute/0 tx\" one until the thread can catch up and build one with available tx.\nI see params of getblocktemplate that obviously won't allow using this optimization (passing the transactions for the most obvious) but my lack of knowledge of the actual template format and build process makes me wonder what other params could prevent this kind of optimization to be useful. At least it seems to me that with no params the optimization should work and allow for o(1) scaling for getblocktemplate. In the end my suggestion only makes sense if most pools could benefit from it and aren't forced to use params that prevent it from being useful.\n",

For example I suspect (again: uninformed guess) that slow calls to getmininginfo and getblocktemplate use the same access pattern to an internal tx structure and could benefit from the same optimization (at least they became slow on my node when the number of tx started to grow). At some point when multiple tools all implement the same algorithm on top of another tool the question of integrating this algorithm in the common tool becomes valid (the answer isn't always obvious though).\nIt could become more obvious when the heavy client only makes sense for pool owners/miners (and most end-users have migrated to lightweight clients).\n\nIt's just an idea to test the waters (mainly to avoid wasting time with it if the template build process intrinsically can't benefit from this approach), it's far from a feature request.\n\nI'm more and more interested by the node's source code and how I could play with it but I just scraped the surface...\n",

The miner doesn't want to use an old cached template to avoid wasting work but can't simply call getblocktemplate naively if it wants a fast reply (event after a new block there can be and often is a lot of transactions to include in a template).\nIt can receive a notification from the node (there are already interfaces for that). I assume that to minimize latency it can call getblocktemplate with an emplty tx list to get a fast reply and immediately call it again without specifying the list to include txs as soon as possible.\nAs many pools have closed source software I'm not sure if they really implement this kind of behaviour. Latency issues may be solved by simply publishing recommendations for miner software instead of modifying bitcoind itself. As p2pool is probably the most likely to benefit from this, I'll link this post in the p2pool bitcointalk.org thread and continue there to avoid deviating even more from the subject here.\n",
