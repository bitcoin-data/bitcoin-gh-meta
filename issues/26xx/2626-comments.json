The result of someone hijacking github, controlling people's connections, or holding one of the developers with access at gunpoint could be very problematic.

This is not so much a problem for the version notice itself, but if you refer them to that site to download a new version they will download a potentially infected client from the attacker. \n\nI remember some FinFisher scandal in which they pushed fake updates (to some software already on the user's computer) to install malware, so this threat is not hypothetical.  And even with SSL it would still be relying on a single point of failure...\n\nFor any auto-update, the client has to do the downloading + dev signature verification at least. Installation should be left to the user voluntarily (ie, \"this is the list of changes, click here if you want to upgrade\") .\n\nMaybe we could use a form of signing that does not require a complete GPG to be packaged? Or is there some lightweight library that allows verifying GPG signatures?\n",

Could be sourceforge, etc. (round robin, take next when one is not available)\n-> each update/version has a hash of the binary signed with the \"bitcoin official\" key\n-> each update/version has multiple developers signatures (at least 3).\n-> rss feed will be used to determine if a update is available\n\nDuring update:\n-> Binary will be downloaded\n-> Binary will be changed/verified against local available developers public key (at least 3)\n-> Binary will be changed/verified against local available bitcoin official key\n-> Binary will be extracted\n-> (some optional checks)\n-> Binary, etc. will be replaced\n-> Bitcoin client will be relaunched.\n\nPotential attacks:\n-> Someone could compromise the RSS feed. But without developers and \"bitcoin official\" private keys, hacked binaries will not get installed\n-> Someone could compromise a binary at sourceforge, etc. But it wont get installed because of invalid binary hashes.\n-> Someone changes local installed public keys (trojan) and also changes the RSS feed (by hacking the installed binary and changing the RSS URL or compromising the remote RSS Feed).\n\nMITM should not be possible (or at least they would need a lot of effort).\n\nDeployment:\n-> when having a final RC, the releasemanager could send the binary to different developers to get the signature in return. The signature then must be included in the RSS feed.\n\nProblems:\n-> The deployment process might gets more complex.\n",

E.g. https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-core-dev, https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/ or any other website that does it\r\n* You can ask your package manager for updates. E.g. the Ubuntu ppa would update on your request. However, the ppa has been discontinued in favor of the snap package https://snapcraft.io/bitcoin-core, which allows you to set specific update rules. Or the flathub package https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.bitcoincore.bitcoin-qt\r\n* Something else I missed to mention",
