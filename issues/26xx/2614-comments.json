Even on Windows we first have that normal tray icon and after loading it switches to testnet. I think it's worth to think about a better solution that covers all OSes and directly displays the correct icon.\n\nWe currently set the default icon in the BitcoinGUI constructor, where we don't have acces to clientmodel, which is used to query for testnet later... see the problem? @laanwj Do you have a good idea?\n",

This has no analog in any other OS.\n\nIt is usually desirable to move the common code to a function, but in this case it's only one line (and result purely visual) so I'm not so sure.\n\nOn windows/linux it would be possible to change the icon a little bit sooner (ie, immediately when creating the main window) but mehh. It's only testnet, only developers get to see it anyway. Don't obsess about it too much.\n",
