Where's the blocks?\n\nI get a new empty datadir/testnet3 subdirectory.\n\nbitcoin-qt.exe -datadir=c:\\testnet (with a testnet=1 bitcoin.conf file\noption in that directory) stored wallet/blocks/chainstate in the root\nwith previous versions. Now the root datadir data is ignored (except the\nconfig file) and a new hierarchy was created in subdirectory\n[b]/testnet3[/b].\n\nSo what's happening?\n\nThis looks to be done by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2605\n... after searching the code for the change and then finding the commit.\n\n1 day from opened to committed, released six days later... no changelog.\n\nThe datadir previously worked as I expected with both bitcoin-qt and\nbitcoind interacting with no problems, when simply specifying a\ncommand-line datadir, so I don't see the bug.\n\nI can see how the previous behavior might be dangerous if the config\nfile was removed. I just did that, and there's a cool freakout where my\ntestnet wallet balance looks like real BTC and Bitcoin tries to reorg\n67662 blocks starting from the genesis block. After receiving real block\n73354 per debug log, a nice unrecoverable crash:\n\n\"Assertion failed!\"\nFile: src/main.cpp Line 1745\nExpression: pfork != NULL\n\nThis needs to be added to the changelog, since dropping in this binary\nwill break testnet stuff if anybody is using Bitcoin this way for their\ntestnet faucet, etc:\n\n\" \\* testnet data now stored in testnet3 subdirectory, enforced even when\nspecifying datadir on command line (manually move your data first)\"\n",
