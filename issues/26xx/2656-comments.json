RPC, as it is now, is not good enough for implementing Bitcoin-Qt remotely. It lacks notification support and more fine-grained queries on the transaction / address lists, and other small things. I suggest using one of the UIs that @jonasschnelli mentions.\n\nA split at wallet - block chain daemon level is preferred to this right now (and is being worked on). It would allow more flexible setups like running multiple wallets from one block chain source.\n",
