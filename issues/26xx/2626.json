Doesnt have to be a full on auto-update, just an update checker and notify user new version is available.\n\nSuggestion is to use the RAW feature of github to host the latest version at github.com/bitcoin.org, something this:\n\nhttps://raw.github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.org/master/README.md which makes use of both SSL and git versioning (which makes it not only difficult to change, but tamper evident).\n",
