      "body" : "After posting the issue here, i went to bed and when I woke up, almost all my transactions was confirmed, so I decided to try to rescan the blockchain again to see if I would receive the error agin, but this time it rescaned the blockchain without problem. I thought \"maybe the error was ocurring when there's too many unconfirmed transactions\". I decided to create more 15000 transactions and then I rescanned the blockchain again. And again no problem during the rescan, all went fine even with more than 15000 transactions to confirm. So as I wasn't able to reproduce the error again, I'm closing this.\n\nPS: all above was done with the same 0.8.1 version.\n",
