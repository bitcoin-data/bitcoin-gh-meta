      "body" : "@kekimusmaximus thanks for the advice. I had compatible BDB installed via the PPA (https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/+archive/ubuntu/bitcoin) for a while but that uninstalled itself during an update which is when I started having this problem. Looks like this issue has been known for a while?\r\n\r\n> The gdb error is in libdb_cxx-4.8.so while you had to provide --with-incompatible-bdb which means that it was detecting 5.x headers.\r\n\r\n@jonasschnelli  @laanwj Yes it is pretty confusing to me. 4.8 was removed from the system (by apt), 5.x was installed by apt, everything broke. I have since updated that installation, but I tried to recreate the issue in a virtual machine so that I could provide you with the config.log but I'm not getting the error now. \r\n\r\nMaybe the issue only comes up if you upgrade from compatible (4.8) to incompatible (5.x) BDB and something weird gets messed up by autotools when you use the --with-incompatible-bdb option (leftover files it sees or something???)? \r\n\r\nI need to test on the virtual machine whether doing the upgrade is what caused the issue, I'll close this ASAP if I can't replicate it that way.",

      "body" : "I found the reason of this issue, and a solution (a good workaround).\r\n\r\nThe issue occurs (in my case) with Ubuntu 18.04, when I install both libdb-4.8++ and libdb-5.3++.  I need those 2, because I do compile programs that require both versions (legacy and new programs).\r\n\r\nI installed both versions from Ubuntu standard PPA, and you end up with both versions installed (libdb_cxx-4.8.so and libdb-5.3_cxx.so).\r\n\r\nAlso, and this is an important point, is that you also do get only one header set installed, which are db.h and db_cxx.h for version 5.3.  So, when 'configure' goes through the detection phase, it does detect that the DB_VERSION_MAJOR/DB_VERSION_MINOR is 5.3 (this is from db.h for version 5.3).\r\n\r\nSo, you have no choice but to use libdb_cxx-5.3.  But here, just specifying --with-incompatible-bdb is not enough when you have both version installed, you MUST ALSO specify BDB_LIBS=\"-ldb_cxx-5.3\" on the configure line.  That is, you must specify\r\n\r\n`./configure --with-incompatible-bdb BDB_LIBS=\"-ldb_cxx-5.3\"`\r\n\r\nWithout that, i.e. when you just specify the incompatible option, and not the BDB_LIBS option, then the 'bitcoin-find-bdb48.m4' autoconf file will just search for 'libdb_cxx-4.8.so', and find that this file exist.  So, it will create Makefiles linking with '-ldb_cxx4.8', but uses include file db_cxx.h which does include the db.h for version 5.3.  So, you end up with 3 things, that is: 5.3 header, 4.8 lib, and a segfault.\r\n\r\nAgain, this issue is there because I have both 4.8 and 5.3 installed, and the 'bitcoin-find-bdb48.m4' is not able to cope with this case, and use the version from the header file (i.e. detect that 5.3 header is present, and so, use -ldb_cxx-5.3).\r\n\r\nBy specifying\r\n\r\n`./configure --with-incompatible-bdb BDB_LIBS=\"-ldb_cxx-5.3\"`\r\n\r\nyou end up acknowledging that you use a 'legacy wallet incompatible' BDB (ignore the fact that v5.3 is detected), and ACTUALLY link against 5.3\r\n\r\nEric",
