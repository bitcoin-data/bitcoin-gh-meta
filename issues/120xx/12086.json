   "body" : "hey,\r\nbeen using  bitcoin for some time, but I am a total noob when it comes to linux and running a full bitcoin node.\r\nI have setup a Raspberry Pi3, connected an external HDD, installed Bitcoin Core wallet and started downloading the blockchain.\r\nFirst time it got to sync 1.5% and the wallet application disappeared. Have restarted it, syncing started again from zero. Same happened again at around 1.5%. Third time, I shut down Bitcoin core manually, opened it again, and this time it started were it left. \r\nSo, in theory, if I would save the progress at every single percent increase, I will successfully sync it.\r\n\r\ndebug file is here: \r\nhttps://wetransfer.com/downloads/fd4e92eca8fb5c56a4b4b66be80585e120180104040738/ef36818110052c61ab46204356a8d0c820180104040738/fcd107\r\n\r\nI also noticed, that the processor of RPi has become very hot. could it be system kills the process as it causes the overheat?\r\n\r\nany possible suggestions?",
