   "body" : "This prepares the version scheme for the upcoming 17.0.0 release (formerly known as 0.17.0). After branching off 0.16.0, we could start referring to master as 16.99.0.\r\n\r\nThe current version scheme is `0.MAJOR.MINOR`, c.f. https://bitcoincore.org/en/lifecycle/#versioning.\r\nThe proposed version scheme is `MAJOR.MINOR.0`, i.e. dropping the constant prefix `0.`.\r\n\r\nParticipants of #9653 also proposed other versioning schemes, which come with downsides:\r\n* The version scheme `MAJOR_YEAR.MAJOR_MONTH.MINOR`, where `MAJOR_YEAR` and `MAJOR_MONTH` refer to when the release cycle started. For version numbers to be predictable (like they are for ubuntu), we'd *had to* either prepare a release every 6 months or come up with a name for \"the next version\". Neither solution is feasible for this project.\r\n* The `1.0.0` version scheme. This is also infeasible as outlined in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/9653#issuecomment-276125338 and subsequent comments.\r\n \r\nSo I'd propose to stick with the existing version scheme or drop the leading zero.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Obviously, this does *not* mean Bitcoin Core is all of a sudden less experimental than before.",
