As a result, I think the 0 is an artifact that we'll either be stuck with forever, or at some point (now or later) arbitrarily remove.\n\nWhile I agree that lots of work remains, and more in some parts of the software than others, this does not imply immaturity. No software is ever finished. We're treating the X in 0.X.Y as the *major* version number already (and have been calling it that way as long as I remember), with a long well-established release process along it. It is used by many in production environments, and we strongly care about compatibility across versions to enable that.\n\nI certainly don't think Bitcoin is \"done\", but Bitcoin Core is a mature client for the protocol as it exists today.",
