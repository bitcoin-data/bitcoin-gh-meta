Some of them are listed as follows\r\nwalletnotify=\"/home/ec2-user/cron/receive.php %s\"\r\nwalletnotify=/home/ec2-user/cron/receive.php \"%s\"\r\nwalletnotify=\"/home/ec2-user/cron/receive.php\" %s\r\nwalletnotify=/bin/bash /home/ec2-user/cron/receive.sh %s\r\nwalletnotify=/bin/php /home/ec2-user/cron/receive.php %s\r\n\r\n- I also tried by creating a separate page and configured it through CURL command as follows\r\n   walletnotify=/bin/curl http://127.0.0.1/receive.php?trx=%s\r\n\r\nI also tried by running the **bitciond** daemon from root user. I also verified folder permissions which are fine.\r\n\r\nIn short I have been struggling with this from couple of days but unable to succeed.\r\nI always get same error which is **return -1** along with the command that I entered in configuration file.\r\n\r\nNot to mention that rest of the **bitcoin core** features are working fine. My block chain database is also up to date.\r\n\r\nHere are my current configuration parameters.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\ntestnet=1\r\nserver=1\r\nrpcuser=root\r\nrpcpassword=123\r\nrpcallowip=127.0.0.1\r\nrpcport=6806\r\nwalletnotify=/home/ec2-user/cron/receive.sh %s\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIs there something I am missing?\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
