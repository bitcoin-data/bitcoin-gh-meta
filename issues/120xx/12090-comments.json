Please correct me If I am guessing wrong that one of the possible reason could be the db is in synchronization process with the main block chain testnet database. Once synchronization is completed then it will issue walletnotify command.\r\n\r\nIs there any other way I can trigger this walletnotify event separately without synchronizing the database  for testing purpose?\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  ",
