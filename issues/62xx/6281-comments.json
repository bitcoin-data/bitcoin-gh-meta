      "body" : "I was playing with recursively splitting utxos recently, and managed to fill my two testnet nodes mempools to 300mb (>110k tx's) over half an hour. One node was used for broadcasting, the other for informational purposes. Both gave similar results throughout, so I suspect many nodes accumulated the same. https://www.blocktrail.com/tBTC/address/mvoh3Jwirz6YLdSdpp1558uHWdJ9Qpijjg \r\n\r\nSince all of these transactions were dependent on a single UTXO, perhaps nodes could limit the number of dependant transactions in the memory pool. As @ashleyholman noted, tracking hierarchy is probably a good idea, since after pruning an unconfirmed transaction with 100k unconfirmed child transactions, further spammy spends would no longer be added to the mempool as the inputs would be missing. \r\n\r\nI'm less clear on how this would affect the relay policy however - not relaying child-of-pruned transactions means the spammer (or legitimate user) would need to find other peers. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Also, if the presence of a transaction in the mempool *is* a requirement to relay other, dependent unconfirmed transactions, you could exhaust the networks mempool as a whole by giving it a fixed size. \r\n\r\nI managed to produce 1/4 of your proposed limit in an hour or two. I had a 4000 tBTC output to play with, which should have given me millions of transactions, but I cut it off. I can probably determine the minimum sized output needed to produce your limit.. will try this now. ",

In my mind though, you would keep all the transactions in a sorted list (or up to 3 lists, one by priority, one by fee, one for wallet transactions) and that same sorting would be used in 3 places.  For booting things at the end to limit mempool size, for creating new blocks, and for improvements to fee estimation.   The sorted list is a requirement to really improve the fee estimation over where it is now with just some historical analysis.\r\n\r\nAs for the priority calculation code, it does appear in a couple of places, but I fixed the one instance where it was calculating it differently.  They all result in the same calculation now.",

As morcos says, though, handling priority is tricky because priority changes over time, although I bet some clever thinking could come up with a way to represent priorities that takes advantage of the fact that priorities only get better over time, they never get worse.\r\n",

Or also the other way (wtx outpoint used in tx input and marked for deletion during poolsweep).\r\n\r\nBut the potential privacy leak is indeed a problem. And thanks for bringing this up.\r\n\r\nWhat if we just make sure the wallet can handle mempool removals of any type (no\r\nprotection of wtx at all)?\r\n\r\nWorst case to handle is probably a chain (or just \"flat\" and multiple) of low fee self-transaction used as 0conf-inputs for a outgoing standard wtx.\r\n\r\nSuddenly remove of a incoming 0conf wtx should be tolerated and is already possible in other wallets.\r\n\r\nIf someone spends a 0conf he takes the risk of producing a invalid wtx.",

Can no one broadcast a 500 byte transaction to that peer without paying a 100KB fee first?\r\n\r\nI think the logic should be to pay the fee for your transaction plus the fee per kb of tx you replaced. The 100KB transaction would be dropped and the next 100KB worth of transactions added to the mempool would need account for that 100KB transactions fee.",
