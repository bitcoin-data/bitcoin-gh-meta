I assume they are just not bothering to set a custom limit.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that if we are currently using 400kb, and the number of transactions continue to increase at the current rate, it won't be long before that number increases, and it's going to take a while for miners to get up to date so I feel it's better to increase it a bit now, while we wait for consesus around the 'hard' block size limit increase, or other viable solutions to scalability to come along.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting that the data Luke has used removes 'Microtransactions' and transaction which Luke has classified as 'Inefficient/data use of the blockchain', but nevertheless are still occurring.

Computing the average for the whole day, they get 20, so in order to optimize costs, they reduce their switching hardware capacity to 20 parallel phone calls. Does it make sense?\r\n\r\nObviously, no. If people will find that they can't use phone during the day, they will believe that quality of this company's service is extremely poor and phone is pretty much useless.\r\n\r\nThere is in fact  a branch of operations research called queueing theory which studies things like that, and can be used, among other things, to find optimal capacity. But who needs these complexities when you use **average**, the pinnacle of mathematical thought (according to Luke-jr)?",

Though that said bigger picture discussion is better off on the mailing list, and/or forums like reddit.\r\n\r\nRe: default blocksize, what should actually happen is it should be removed and replaced by a calculation that takes orphan risk into account. Basically, every transaction you add increases the chance of orphaning your block by some amount due to the larger size. If you know that marginal increase you can then keep a running tally of total block reward and stop adding transactions when marginal reward > marginal cost. As it turns out that constant can be calculated from the orphan rate and your own hash rate relatively easily, and orphan rate can be observed. (IIRC the constant basically has bytes/second as its units) There is the nuance that much of the hashing power has special peering setups that push orphan rate to near zero; your blocks don't necessarily get to participate in those peering setups. \r\n\r\nOf course, actually writing that patch and setting the default marginal orphan rate constant appropriately would be a great backdoor way of increasing the default max blocksize to 1MB. :)",

The more so a policy default that only applies to miners, not other full nodes. \r\n\r\nWhich is the entire reason that I closed the issue. \r\n\r\nAgain, lobby miners to increase the above option value. They can, and they are aware of it. There is no reason at all for this to be decision for Bitcoin Core development.  Everyone has their own responsibility in this decentralized network. Don't try to play it through me, I'm just here for bugs and issues related to the implementation.\r\n\r\n(and yes, the current default value was grandfathered in, not as a \"policy\" but as a working default value - maybe @luke-jr is right and these defaults should be removed completely, *forcing* miners to set them. I've always pushed back against that because it makes upgrading for miners harder, and they are already a conservative bunch)\r\n",
