      "body" : "It my experience testing this, it just did the \"right thing\" tm. Because the old/new .app's use the same identifier, the older one was hidden and only the new one shows. I made sure to test that before ACKing the name change. @jonasschnelli Does the opposite happen for you?\r\n\r\n@laanwj To clarify: Usually when you drag an updated .App do Applications, it'll replace the old one. Now, it hides the old one in the launcher and only shows the new one. The old Bitcoin-Qt is still visible in the file explorer and can be deleted. So to the average user, they click -> drag, and the new .app shows up as expected. I don't think it's a messy outcome at all.\r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed is that the timestamps are nasty, because we hard-code them in gitian. Maybe bumping the gitian faketime stamps to a more current time would help to distinguish the old/new versions, especially when sorting is involved.\r\n\r\nOne quick thought: the osx manifest might allow us to account for this type of movement, checking now.",

      "body" : "My concerns are more in a different direction. I think the drag'copy delete'old-app thing is not a big issue. There could be a confusing when one uses spotlight (osx search engine) or when users go over finder directly to the application dir.\r\n**But:** What made me open a PR for the revert, is, that the name inconsistency over the platforms just feels bad. If we use Bitcoin-Core for OSX while still using \"bitcoin-qt\" for windows and linux,... this is wrong. Fresh osx users then don't understand when people write about \"bitcoin-qt\" (stackexchange, discussion forums, etc.).\r\n\r\nHere i'm trying to take the all or nothing position. Either we rename bitcoin-qt to Bitcoin-Core or \"bitcoin-core-ui\" or we keep it consistent with the \"old\" bitcoin-qt over all platforms.\r\n\r\nWhat made me originally think about renaming was, that \"bitcoin-qt\" is somehow a strange application name. Bitcoin-Core as name is nice and users can distinct \"bitcoin\" (technology) and \"bitcoin-core\" (application). Bitcoin-qt is a combination of two technologies names and therefore unsuitable as branding name for a UI application.\r\nBut i'm also aware of the implication a full rename from `bitcoin-qt` to `bitcoin-core` (binary) would be.\r\nBut, if i would hold the steering wheel by myself, i would do the rename and would completely get rid of `bitcoin-qt` everywhere where it's visible to users (not to devs).",
