      "body" : "Hmmm.. that's interesting. Are you sure this is related to the comparison tool?\r\n\r\nI'm asking, because I've never seen timeouts in another project/fork, which is currently based on Bitcoin Core 0.10. There are probably less than 10 builds per day though. But what I actually noticed: after testing a migration to 0.11 (based on [053110d](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/053110ddcb1cc5a20658075f1768da87681b98ec)), the Boost tests [timed out from time to time](https://travis-ci.org/dexX7/bitcoin/jobs/65724188#L1821), but not always.\r\n\r\nI assumed this was somehow a mistake on my part, or simply \"bad luck\". The number of 0.11 builds was very low, and right now 0.10 is still used, so this might not be related at all. On top, Travis builds are routed through the container based infrastructure.\r\n\r\nHowever, when running `./src/test/test_bitcoin --log_level=test_suite` in a loop locally (done a few minutes ago), it stops at some point here:\r\n```\r\nEntering test suite \"scheduler_tests\"\r\nEntering test case \"manythreads\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this rules out that it's related to Travis. I'm going to test a clean version of Core now.",
