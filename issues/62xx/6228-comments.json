      "body" : "Not sure I entirely understand the goal here -- after #5662, we are now going to be sending getheaders to all network nodes, just not immediately.  Instead, we wait until our headers chain is almost current (```pindexBestHeader->GetBlockTime() > GetAdjustedTime() - 24 * 60 * 60```), and then we send getheaders to all our network peers.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that we do this so that we're not downloading the full headers chain from multiple peers unnecessarily.  There is a tradeoff there, but I think even if we are to consider a different tradeoff and be more willing to download duplicate data, then the right way to do it would involve changing the code in SendMessages (around line 4955).",
