Apart from its original form, now this PR additionally has the a removal of the now-unnecessary check for the genesis hash block (and an additional big indentation commit).\nLet's wait for testing, I think it was safer to just merge #6299, but I truly believe the existence of a fully-trustable genesis checkpoint is the necessary step for decoupling the checkpoint logic from any notion of chainparams or a genesis block hash. I think I'm finding enough prove that problems can spring by not doing so and - still - this PR would be minimal if the enum-to-string was merged somewhere else (like in the currently closed #6229 or an improved subset of it) and ignoring the trivially-verifiable indentation. \n",
