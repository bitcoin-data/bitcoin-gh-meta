I's about rescan.\nThe testnet blockchain has over 1 million blocks and 53,000 (the beginning of my log sample above) isn't 17% of that and 632,818 (the end of my sample) isn't 98.9% of that.  (Assuming 0.xy means xy %.)\n\nAnd no, it does cause extra wait because if it took me 3 minutes to get to 38%, it should take me less than 9 minutes to complete rescan. If I can tell online rescan is expected to take hours, I can stop bitcoind, rescan, start bitcoind again and likely save 50% of the total time required for online rescan. That doesn't have practical downside compared to online scan because during online rescan bitcoind can't do anything anyway.\n\nIn any case, either a clarification (docs) of what the progress bar indicates or a change in the code would make it easier for users to make informed decisions.\n",

If the time to scan a block is related to its size, then the % calculation just needs to take into account the size of data so far known, and the size so far scanned to come up with a more accurate percentage. It seems it is not currently doing that for it to be considering up to block 53404 as 17% of the entire block chain.\n",
