When your issue went up I went to one of my nodes and saw similar results: in some cases I was getting 12 duplicates, the behavior was recent and not reflected in older logs.\n\nI then quickly implemented a bunch of additional logging and restarted and in several days have not seen a _single_ other instance of excessive repeats. (I see usually one, sometimes a couple when they race, never more than four (not three because sometimes a block comes right after changing preferences, and sometimes the tree HB peers come in when we've getdataed from a non-HB peer)).\n\nI carefully reviewed both the requesting and responding code in both master and 0.13.1 and am reasonably confident that there is no simple bug in Bitcoin Core that could have caused that behavior. So in the absence of further information I would guess the cause was someone running broken customized things or an ineffectual attempt at an attack.\n\nI've frequently seen nodes cramming whole unrequested blocks at us... compact blocks are at least an improvement over that.\n\n> why is the contents of every cmpctblock received different?\n\nRead the spec, it improves resistance to collisions by causing any collision induced reconstruction error to happen randomly across the network instead of the same for everyone at once.\n",
