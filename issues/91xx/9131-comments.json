I have some of those changes queued up, but I didn't want to stand in the way of the feature. For now, let's just make this atomic.\n\nUltimately, CConnman::Start and CConnman::Stop need to be used for network activation. They were designed to function that way, it's just not complete yet. The idea is that the network threads stop when the toggle is set, which would guarantee that p2p is really down. What's missing is the ability to bring it back up with the same config.\n",

There is literally tons of CS literature about synchronization primitives. \nIn any case atomic access 'protects' only one variable, whereas locks can protect multiple from concurrent access. As there is nothing else that needs to remain internally consistent at the same time as fNetworkActive changes, an atomic will do.\n",
