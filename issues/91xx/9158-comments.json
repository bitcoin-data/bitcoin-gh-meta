I'm not sure if its a change that we'll get in for 0.14, but would be nice to agree we can move forward with it.\n\nThe RPC calls in particular though I thought we might leave around for backwards compatibility until we'd given users enough notice.\n\nI just looked and there are a couple of cleanups that could be done now though if you are interested.  In tests, qt and wallet code there are calls to estimate*priority that are now useless.  They could be removed.  I'd be happy to review that PR.\n",
