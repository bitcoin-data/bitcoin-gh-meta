   "body" : "Following the core dev IRC discussion today, this is a straightforward step per the suggestion at https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2022-03-17.html#l-652.  Users can still opt in to adjusted time by setting `-maxtimeadjustment` with a value greater than zero. This allows gaining feedback as to what extent user space depends on adjusted time.\r\n\r\nIf we want to remove the adjusted time code down the road, it makes sense to give users the fallback option to use adjusted time for a release or two. This also reduces our code reversion risk in the case that users rely on it. The release notes would describe the change and suggest that the option is being deprecated for future removal.\r\n\r\nSee #7573 and #4521 for further context.",
