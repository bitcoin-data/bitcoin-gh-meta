I had in mind to do this as well for a while.\r\n\r\n> I think we should not be giving version numbers in examples as this might incur a maintenance burden on the documentation as time passes.\r\n\r\nI agree in general. However not sure which version you're referring to exactly;\r\n\r\n- mentioning the OpenBSD version is pretty important; maybe not so much going forward, but there had to be significant changes for each release. So mentioning it gives some assurance that it's up to date, and the maintenance burden is there anyway.\r\n- automake/autoconf rarely have releases. It's some extra burden to track them, but on the other hand it's a lot easier to be able to copy/paste instead of having to check. Also, mentioning versions that work could be useful, there have been breaking changes to them for the BSDs in the past.",
