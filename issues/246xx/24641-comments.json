Because we want to use aggregate initialization, we will be forced to get rid of some constructors when we update to c++20, and the macro helps work around that.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure this macro is ideal, though, and I think it might be good to try to improve it. I'm mainly concerned it will be applied places it doesn't belong. Two cases where no-copy-only-move behavior is useful are:\r\n\r\n1. When you have a class that is expensive to copy, and a cheap to move, and you want to disable default copy behavior to avoid slow copying by accident.\r\n2.  When you are using a low level C API, and are trying to wrap up low level C pointers or file descriptors or handles in RAII classes.\r\n\r\nI don't think we have a lot of examples of the second case, so can probably ignore it. But for the first case, the macro sucks a little because it disable copying _entirely_ instead of disabling copying by _default_ which makes code annoying to work with and test, especially since when you test you often do want to be able to copy entire data structures. Also starting the name with AGGREGATE_ probably means developers will apply macro to aggregate initialized structs freely, which will make this even more annoying.\r\n\r\nI think a better version of this macro would be called something like `DISABLE_IMPLICIT_COPIES` and would disable the copy constructor and assignment methods, while adding `T Copy() const` and `void CopyFrom(const T&)` methods that do allow convenient copying where intended",

      "body" : "> It looks like an implicitly `deleted` function can not be \"recovered\" by `default`ing.\r\n\r\nI don't think the followup I'm suggesting should cause the copy asssignment operator to be implicitly deleted, so there be no need to recover it. But the PR in its current form seems fine, and we can iterate on it. If iteraton requires dropping explicit Copy methods to support c++20, that seems sad but not tragic.\r\n\r\n> Thus, it seems impossible to have a `Copy`/`CopyFrom` macro _and_ aggregate initialization that works with both C++17 and C++20.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced of this, but there's no need to solve it now, and I think the macro here already provides an improvement. It would be good to have a unit test to check that the macro allows all the things it is supposed to allow in c++17. If it has to drop support for some of those things in c++20, the test could catch that and be updated at that time to reflect this.",
