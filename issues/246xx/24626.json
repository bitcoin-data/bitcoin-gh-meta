   "body" : "The combination of `-reindex-chainstate` and `-prune` currently makes the node stuck in an endless loop:\r\n\r\n- `LoadChainstate()` will wipe the existing chainstate (so we have no genesis block anymore). It won't clean up unusable block files by calling `WriteReindexing()` as for full `-reindex`.\r\n- `ThreadImport()` has [logic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/91d12344b1e51809c1ef6b630b631a6da00267c3/src/node/blockstorage.cpp#L855) of reloading Genesis after reindexing. This is what makes full `-reindex` work with `-prune` but it's not executed for `-reindex-chainstate`.\r\n- Since we still don't have a genesis block, init will wait for it forever in an endless loop ([code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/91d12344b1e51809c1ef6b630b631a6da00267c3/src/init.cpp#L1630-L1640)).\r\n\r\nFix this by disallowing `-reindex-chainstate` together with `-prune`. This is discouraged in the help for `-reindex-chainstate` anyway (\"When in pruning mode or if blocks on disk might be corrupted, use full -reindex instead.\") but wasn't enforced.\r\n\r\nFixes #24242",
