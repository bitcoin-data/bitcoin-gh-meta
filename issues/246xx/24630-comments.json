That could mean querying the index database for an existing entry, and if it's identical to the new one (e.g. by comparing height and hash), stop the processing.\r\n\r\nDo you think that this should be specific to `-reindex-chainstate` or would all of this also apply to `-reindex`?

Just warn that indexes can't currently be enabled when the \"-reindex-chainstate\" is in use and don't start them.\r\n2. Delay starting indexes when \"-reindex-chainstate\" is used until the new chainstate tip catches up to the previous tip\r\n3. Add a new \"-reindex-everything\" option that does what this PR does and wipes all indexes. If the \"-reindex-chainstate\" option is used when indexes are enabled it could fail and suggest temporary disabling the indexes or using \"-reindex-everything\" as alternatives.\r\n\r\nProbably an ideal fix could be entirely contained in the BaseIndex class. It could just avoid doing any work and not consider any any index to be synced until the first BlockConnected notification arrives which is not an ancestor of the index's known best block. This behavior could be conditional on \"-reindex-chainstate\" or it could just be generic behavior.\r\n\r\nIndexes already do have some current behavior that is a little lazy like this. For example, indexes currently don't handle BlockDisconnected events, but instead wait for the next BlockConnected event before they rewind.\r\n",

So \"-reindex\" is currently \"-reindex-everything\" (including the Block Index database).\r\n\r\nOption 1) should be trivial to implement, but the warning could be missed by the user who then wonders why the index isn't running.\r\n\r\n> Delay starting indexes when \"-reindex-chainstate\" is used until the new chainstate tip catches up to the previous tip\r\n> Probably an ideal fix could be entirely contained in the BaseIndex class.

Clearing the indexes is better than corrupting them, but still seems like a surprising and potentially undesirable behavior. Code and tests in this PR seem like a useful start for getting the indexing options to work better together, though.",
