This way too we don't poll e.g. `bitcoin-cli help` with each `tab` on autocomplete? You could just re-run the script after you compile, if you want to update completions. \r\n\r\nIt would want to be run with `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` running so that it generated all the correct completions, but other than that it would work better IMO, except from the fact that it would not be dynamic w.r.t. the current version of bitcoin installed automatically.\r\n\r\nI haven't personally noticed any runtime performance issue tbh, but thinking about how to fix the `error` and `Make` autocompletions you mention above made me wonder if the above approach might be a little better...",

And even then, there would need to be some logic to check CWD and see if we dynamically generate for binary in current dir, or on PATH. Even if we got all that working, user would need to re-generate each time they wanted to switch between a local dir binary and binary on PATH (to the best of my knowledge)...\r\n\r\n- [x] Completions that require user provided parameter (those that show up as ending with a `=`) put a space after the option which requires an additional backspace in order to be able to set the parameter.\r\n\r\n",

And even then, there would need to be some logic to check CWD and see if we dynamically generate for binary in current dir, or on PATH. Even if we got all that working, user would need to re-generate each time they wanted to switch between a local dir binary and binary on PATH (to the best of my knowledge)...\r\n\r\nIt doesn't necessarily need to work with relative paths, it just can't be throwing an error.",
