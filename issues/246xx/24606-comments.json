Or are you going to write release notes saying: \"If your system clock is wrong, please make sure to set -maxtimeadjustment to the value your clock is wrong at most.\"  Instead of: \"If your clock is wrong, correct it\".",

If there's no urgent need to rip it all out, which may be convenient for us but is a larger change, it may make sense to give users the fallback option to use adjusted time for a release or two. This also reduces code reversion risk in the unexpected case that users rely on it (though I don't feel competent to second-guess what users are doing or not doing). The release notes would describe the change and suggest that the option is being deprecated for future removal. ",

So it would be good to know if any users are using this, and I think the most effective way to find out is by removing it (User will see an init error on startup, if they are using it). I am not sure how many users would notice with just the default value changed and a release note snippet. An alternative would be to add a `-settingdeprecated=` setting, similar to `-rpcdeprecated=`?\r\n\r\nAgain, I am not against the changes here. They look fine and I don't see any harm in them.

So, there is some protection against an attack that attempts to change your node's perspective on time a lot. If your node disagrees substantially with every other node, then you get a warning. But you'll continue to exchange transactions and blocks etc...\"\r\nThis was the justification for setting the flag to zero, when it is used: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7573#issuecomment-192626502\r\nBut, this comment also supports not setting the default to zero: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7573#issuecomment-192584061\r\n\r\nIn summary, I tend to Concept NACK this changing of default for the reasons mentioned.",

Initially, when I proposed the PR that led to the creation of the `-maxtimeadjustment` flag, my thought was something similar to, \"I just want to be able to ignore what other nodes are telling me, because I know better, and I've configured my system.\" Atfer considering what sipa and gmaxwell wrote in that PR's comments, I changed my mind to be more accepting that adjusted time could still be useful for a lot of less actively/professionally managed nodes. I think that sipa's and gmaxwell's wisdom were based on experiences of NTP failing silently, NTP being insecure and spoofable, lack of node upkeep/monitoring, and probably more.\r\n\r\nI still think that adjusted time can serve the same purpose as it did in 2016. I still think that the justification for the `-maxtimeadjustment` flag is still valid too (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7573#issuecomment-192626502). So, I still lean to the Concept NACK on this. But, I'm open to change my mind if there's a new persuasive reason to nuke adjusted time.",

It is certainly not uncommon for some clocks to be broken. I've run into this myself, see for example https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-images/+bug/1896443 . However, Bitcoin Core will already fail to function properly on those systems and adjusted time doesn't correct offsets in the order of days anyway.\r\n\r\nI agree on the warnings. Someone should check that Bitcoin Core raises an InitError when the clock is behind the latest block saved on disk (or maybe the latest data point in the chainTxData). I proposed more aggressive warnings or errors in a recent IRC meeting, but there was no agreement that more aggressive warnings are warranted. So I think we should check that the existing warnings are properly sent out even if the default is set to 0 or the setting removed.",

I had a look at the places where adjusted time is used - there are just a few: I could think of the following items:\r\n\r\n1. (gossip) address relay is very sensitive to the correct time, because addrs will not be relayed for more than 10 minutes after `nTime` of the original self-advertisement. A node with a wrong time can easily become a \"black hole\" for addr relay. This means it's not helping the network by relaying received addrs further along, but that's not really a problem for the node itself because the acceptance of addrs and the process of making outgoing connections to them is not affected.\r\n\r\n1.  a node with a wrong time will find it harder to find inbound peers (because its own self-advertisement will have a `nTime` that is off, and therefore likely not be relayed by others, see previous point). The ability to find outbound peers is not affected.\r\n\r\n1. the `nTime` field in blocks is set based on the maximum of AdjustedTime / MedianTimePast in the mining code. Validation will not allow blocks more than 2 hours in the future (MAX_FUTURE_BLOCK_TIME).  Adjusted Time cannot correct more than 70 minutes though and wouldn't correct anything if the the time was off by more, so I can't really think of a scenario in which it would have saved us to keep with the best chain before. \r\n\r\n1. header sync timeout and `CanDirectFetch()` in `net_processing`. An incorrect time may stall the header timeout / slow down IBD.\r\n\r\nAm I missing anything important?",
