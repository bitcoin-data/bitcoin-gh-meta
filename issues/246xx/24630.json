   "body" : "This resets the index dbs when running `-reindex-chainstate` as was previously done only for `-reindex`.\r\n\r\nIt fixes two bugs with `-reindex-chainstate` in conjunction with the indices:\r\n1. `coinstatsindex` gets corrupted:\r\n`reindex-chainstate`  leads to `BlockConnected()` signals to the index for each block that is reprocessed:\r\nIf the index db is not reset, the running hash `DB_MUHASH` is not reset either and it will include data from each block twice after the reindexing, so the MuHash will be incorrect. I added a test for this that fails on master.\r\n\r\n2. `blockfilterindex` duplicates the flatfile data:\r\nIt has a variable `DB_FILTER_POS` for the current position which would not get reset. As a result, the filterdata would be written twice to disk in succession.\r\n\r\n`txindex` has no running variable like the other two indexes, but I think that conceptually it makes sense to reset the index db here as well.",
