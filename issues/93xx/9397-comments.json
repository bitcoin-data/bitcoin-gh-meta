This information can be inserted by anyone and set to anything, it should not be taken seriously.\r\n- I'm fairly sure stunnel doesn't set X-forwarded-for at all, see the TODO: https://www.stunnel.org/sdf_todo.html\r\n- Also stunnel is usually set up as a protocol-neutral tunnel, so it won't do anything in the sense of HTTP header manipulation\r\n\r\nI'd say the proper way to do logging w/ multiple tunnels is one of, or both:\r\n\r\n- Bind RPC on multple ports, give each tunnel its own destination address/port, log that\r\n- Use the RPC multi-account feature and give every tunnel user their own account.\r\n",
