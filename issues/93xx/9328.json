   "body" : "Currently, when looking at the historical MinRelayFee over time, it's usual pattern is to suddenly jump high when the Memory Usage reaches 100% to then slowly decrease until the same happens again. This causes wildly fluctuating MinRelayFees.\r\n\r\nIntuitively I feel that the maths could be improved such that the MinRelayFee goes up prior to reaching 100% utilization such that an equilibrium can be reached where the memory utilization rarely reaches 100% and the MinRelayFee stays fairly constant (save for influences by market dynamics). For this to be possible the algorithm needs to change to at least allow it to increase in situations other than reaching 100% utilization.",
