   "body" : "The typical usage pattern of `ReserveDestination` is to explicitly `KeepDestination`, or `ReturnDestination` when it's detected it will not be used.\r\n\r\nImplementers such as myself may fail to complete this pattern, and could result in key re-use: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15557#discussion_r271956393\r\n\r\nSince ReserveDestination is currently only used directly in the `CreateTransaction`/`CommitTransaction` flow(or fee bumping where it's just used in `CreateTransaction`), I instead make the assumption that if a transaction is returned by `CreateTransaction` it's highly likely that it will be accepted by the caller, and the `ReserveDestination` kept. This simplifies the API as well. There are very few cases where this would not be the case which may result in keys being burned.\r\n\r\nThose failure cases appear to be:\r\n`CommitTransaction` failing to get the transaction into the mempool\r\nBelt and suspenders check in `WalletModel::prepareTransaction`\r\n\r\nAlternative to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15796",
