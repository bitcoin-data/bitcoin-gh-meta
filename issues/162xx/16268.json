It does work when set as a command line argument. \r\n![Screenshot from 2019-06-22 11-13-43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24950563/59965734-09d43c80-94e0-11e9-914e-e741cec01a0c.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-06-22 11-13-26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24950563/59965735-148ed180-94e0-11e9-9c90-9e53427b41c3.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-06-22 11-08-37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24950563/59965737-1bb5df80-94e0-11e9-86a5-d0fe63457c4a.png)\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\nJust setting the config option without the command line argument recreates the issue. I did test my config file by removing the dbcache setting and that was reflected in the logs.\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-06-22 11-26-23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24950563/59965803-e65dc180-94e0-11e9-8031-a26d69eb8cca.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-06-22 11-26-32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24950563/59965805-eb227580-94e0-11e9-80ac-323d622d0029.png)\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nI am using the downloaded release version 18.0.\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nI am using a laptop with Ubuntu and a platter hard drive.\r\n\r\n<!-- For the GUI-related issue on Linux provide names and versions of a distro, a desktop environment and a graphical shell (if relevant). -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
