It is close to the thing it exports.\nFor example, if you set a filter on your transactions, that is used to filter the output.\n\nAdding a toolbar to the individual tab panes would waste vertical space.\nAnd I don't really want to add any more buttons at the bottom either.\n\nAdding the option to the menu as well sounds OK though...\n",
