   "body" : "Running tests on rc6, I sent 1 BTC to a new wallet, and now am trying to send it back so I can delete the test wallet.\n\nI've been trying for almost 24 hours, but it won't let me send the 1 BTC back - probably because it wants to add the fee on.\n\nIf I ask to send 0.99995 BTC instead, it tells me:\n\n```\n\"This transaction is over the size limit.\"\n```\n\nwhich makes no sense at all to a new user.  They're going to think size = quantity of BTC.\n\nBut it doesn't really make any sense to me either.  i only have one key in use, it's not making up a bigger transaction from multiple coins.  There's no change.  I would have thought this is about the smallest transaction possible.\n\nSo the message is confusing to a new user, and also pretty much incorrect, unless the \"size limit\" is seen as something dynamic which depends on the amount being transferred and the age of the coins involved.\n",
