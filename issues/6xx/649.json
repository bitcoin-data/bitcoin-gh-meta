   "body" : "This patch enables compressed pubkeys when -compressedpubkeys is passed.\nThese are 33 bytes instead of 65, and require only marginally more CPU\npower when verifying. Compressed pubkeys have a different corresponding\naddress, so it is determined at generation. When -compressedpubkeys is\ngiven, all newly generated addresses will use a compressed key, while\nolder/other addresses keep using normal keys. Unpatched clients will\nrelay and verify these transactions.\n\nTested on testnet with both normal and encrypted wallets, using compressed and non-compressed keys.\n\nInitial idea and tests for this patch were done by roconnor.\n",
