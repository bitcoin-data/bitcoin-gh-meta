It now already includes patches and other files that are not used. There is something to be said for keeping the main repository lean and mean.\n- If we made top-level directories for every distribution, we'd end up with total crazyness. Maybe moving it to `contrib` or even a separate repository makes sense. We could give the debian maintainer (and others) direct access there as well...\n\nThat said, quite a lot of open source packages have a \"debian\" directory in their main repository.\n",

Without this, the debian directory is manged in (insert name of third party's tree here) which just becomes a mess (we used to do that for gitian builds, but people complained too much and gitian descriptors were merged upstream).\n\nDebian's arguments against upstream debian directories are (IMHO) very weak.  All they argue is that it makes debian diffs more complicated, but if you've actually used debian's package system, it really handles diffs very cleanly and the added effort for maintainers is absolutely non-existent.\n\nAlso, if people don't want debian in the top level of bitcoin anyway, we can easily just move it to contrib and not have to worry about conflicting with debian's suggestions.\n",
