Someone using an anonymous non-TOR SOCKS proxy will still not want to leak his iP address, it is a serious leak.\n\nIn ancient times I've done something with SOCKS proxies, and I know SOCKS5 supports a \"bind\" call to be able to listen on a the proxy host. This is what ideally should be used in these kind of cases, but I also know 0% of the programs actually implementing a socks proxy support it.\n\nSo the second-best thing is to disable listening (by default -- one may enable it in specific cases) when a proxy is used. BTW if you set your TOR port to the default of 9050 it will automatically regard it as TOR. Did you change the port? that might explain the regression:\n\n```\nbool fTOR = (fUseProxy && addrProxy.port == htons(9050));\n```\n\nIMO this should be an explicit option in the UI, and not some heuristic based on the port.\n\nAnyway, for now you can try if `--nolisten` command line option solves the problem.\n",
