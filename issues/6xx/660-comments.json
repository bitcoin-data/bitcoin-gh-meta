Fortunately, it does not overwrite any real wallet in this case (just the symlink which can be reconstructed easily), so no data is lost. However, I am worried that if the wallet file was for some reason unreadable, that it would also overwrite it. If there is any problem in reading an existing \"wallet.dat\", the program should not touch it, complain about a \"corrupt wallet\" and either quit or continue without a wallet (if there is such a mode). To recover, the user would have to manually remove or fix the \"corrupt\" file, which I think is a reasonable thing to have him do at this point.\n",

But to test that you'll probably have to try with various levels of corruption.\n\nThe best idea I've heard with regard to re-engineering wallet files is an append-only wallet for the private keys. All the private-key action would happen there (and in mlocked main memory), keys could be referred to by number in other places. All the less sensitive mutable metadata such as labels/settings/address book would remain in the old wallet database.\n",
