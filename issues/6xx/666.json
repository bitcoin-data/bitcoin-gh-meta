   "body" : "This finishes a  TODO comment:\n// TODO: mlock memory / munlock on return so they will not be swapped out, really need \"mlockedstring\" wrapper class to do this safely\n\n```\nSecureString is identical to std::string except with secure_allocator\nsubstituting for std::allocator. This makes casting between them\nimpossible, so converting between the two at API boundaries requires\ncalling ::c_str() for now.\n```\n\nThe lack of implicit casting between the two was a big advantage in making this patch thorough, since the build would break if not all the prototypes were updated. So it should also be a 'feature' in making sure implicit casts (meaning gratuitous copies into non-locked memory) aren't accidentally introduced in the future.\n\nPassphrases are now only copied from non-locked memory in askpassphrasedialog.cpp (from Qt's QLineEdit / QString) and in bitcoinrpc.cpp (from whatever library is providing Array; I couldn't tell).\n",
