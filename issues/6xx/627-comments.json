I guess remembering the tab position could be added.\n\n6) NAK - number of transactions has been removed from the overview tab\n\n7,8) Totals send and/or received could be added to overview page\n\n9) When a transaction made it into a block, it could show the block date. I remember @luke-jr did some work in this direction with \"smart dates\" (CWallet::nTimeSmart). I'm not sure there is any reason to not show those in the GUI instead.\n\n10) NAK - too much configurability and room to mess up, IMO should just have a sensibile default\n",
