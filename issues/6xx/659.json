   "body" : "I noticed that my bitcoin client was getting too many connections (> 70), what's weird since I had put it behind Tor (I don't want anyone linking my IP to my transactions).\n\nI ran a \"netstat -ap | grep bitcoin\" and saw that bitcoin was bypassing my proxy configuration, opening my local port 8333 and accepting incoming connections on it. What's more troubling is that, not only it is listening when it should not, but it must be giving away my IP somehow, since all these other peers would not find me otherwise - they would try to connect to the exit-nodes, in vain. Maybe it's accessing the IRC bootstrap channel without using the proxy?\n\nI'm using version 0.5 now. I had not noticed such behavior before, so it is a regression, but I can't tell which version introduced it.\n",
