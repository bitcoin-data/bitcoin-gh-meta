This precaution is headed for an unstoppable disaster. Calling Bitcoin developers: stop supporting this.\r\n\r\nLet's develop the decentralized internet together on applications again, but bitcoin is used by the stock market, not the user.\r\n\r\n### Anonymity and privacy\r\nOur main goal was to use bitcoin independently of the stock market. Ungrateful like Binance and others completely remove the anonymity on the user.\r\n**Bitcoin is no longer secure so Anonymity has been eliminated.**\r\n\r\n### STOP USING BITCOIN",
