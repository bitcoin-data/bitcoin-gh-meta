   "body" : "`--recv-keys` without a `--keyserver` arg simply failed for me on a fresh Arch Linux installation, so I think it's a good idea to suggest a keyserver. OpenPGP ecosystem is broken in a number of ways, so the right way to approach this issue has some potential for bikeshedding. But the only thing that this PR does is to keep `SECURITY.md` in line with the instructions for builder keys, where there was agreement on switching to `keys.openpgp.org` (#22688).",
