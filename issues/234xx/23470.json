   "body" : "Tries to cleanup the wallet build / install documentation. Similar to #23446. \r\nAlways mention how to build for the wallet (sqlite) first, then legacy wallets (bdb).\r\n\r\nWhere possible, just use \"wallet\", rather than \"descriptor wallet\". Non-technical\r\nor causal users don't care about whether the wallet is a descriptor wallet or not,\r\nor what it's backed by they just want to build (and or download) and use Bitcoin Core, \r\ncreate a wallet, and accept a payment. Using \"descriptor wallet\" could also imply \r\nthat there is some other not legacy but also not a descriptor wallet alternative,\r\nwhich there is not.\r\n\r\nUsing 2 terms (wallet and legacy wallet), rather than 5 terms (wallet, \r\nlegacy wallet, bdb wallet, sqlite wallet, descriptor wallet) for the same two things\r\nis also much less confusing.\r\n\r\nNote that most builders now likely have to do nothing to get \"wallet support\" as\r\nthere's a decent probability they will already have sqlite installed on their system,\r\nand configure no-longer fails if BDB isn't present and `--disable-wallet` hasn't been passed.",
