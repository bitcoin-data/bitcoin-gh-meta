   "body" : "While configuring bitcoin. One can specify not to compile GUI in 2 ways:\r\n\r\n- `./configure --without-gui`\r\n- `./configure --with-gui=no`\r\n\r\nThe issue is that there is no `--help` documentation for the --without-gui command.\r\nI am not aware of this, but it seems like `--with-gui=no` is the latest way of specifying the settings. But some documentation is still using the `--without-gui` convention.\r\n\r\nThere is a need to standardize the docs to one of these options.\r\n\r\nNow we can proceed on these in 2 ways:\r\n1. **Standardize to** `without-gui`. Then we should add --help docs for this command. But the problem with this method is we have two ways of doing the same thing. This increases the number of redundant commands without providing any actual benefit.\r\n2. **Standardize to** `with-gui=no`. In this case, we could go as extreme as to remove the `without-gui` command entirely. This will decrease redundant commands and will allow having a single command to either enable or disable GUI.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to listen to other contributorsâ valuable suggestions on this matter.\r\n",
