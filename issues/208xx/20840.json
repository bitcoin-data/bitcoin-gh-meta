XFCE4, xfwm4.\r\n\r\nI have 'wallet=x' (and several other similar lines) in my bitcoin.conf so wallet x loads every time I start the client.\r\n\r\nI recently used the Qt GUI to close wallet x and then reopened it.\r\n\r\nLater I shut down the client and restarted it and got a warning:\r\n\r\n\"Warning: Ignoring duplicate -wallet x.\"\r\n\r\nIt turns out that closing and reopening the wallet caused it to be listed in a file called settings.json which is used at startup in addition to the bitcoin.conf file. Now the x wallet is listed in 2 places and shows up as a \"duplicate\" just because I closed and reopened it. This seems like undesirable behavior.",
