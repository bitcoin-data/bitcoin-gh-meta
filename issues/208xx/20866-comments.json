I think a good compromise would be a `-backupdir` option, which would *default* to inside the datadir but can be anywhere (even `/` if you want the current behavior).\r\n\r\nIMO ideally there would be no RPCs that write to server-side storage at all. Any backups could be streamed over HTTP and backed up client side. That said, that would be a much larger API as well as code change.\r\n\r\n@practicalswift btw `backupwallet` is missing from your list?",

This is necessary to get the error/status information that wraps it. For larger data it might be better to use HTTP directly so the result can be downloaded as a file.)\r\n",
