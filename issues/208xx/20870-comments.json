So, occasionally, the input set proposed by Knapsack could include an uneconomical UTXO in its inputs and still be the least wasteful input set overall. I would suggest that we remove Knapsack, and at the same time loosen the input selection for other algorithms, so we permit spending of uneconomical inputs when building transactions at `minRelayTxFeeRate`. That way we retain the Bitcoin Core walletâs propensity to clean up the UTXO set, but unburden users from extraneous cost.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we should restrict Knapsack to only spend uneconomical UTXOs at very low feerates. Iâd prefer altogether removing it, though, over improving it.",
