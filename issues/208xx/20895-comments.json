Either something is acceptable behavior, and we should permit it, or it's not and we should disconnect (or disconnect+discourage if it's actually a DoS risk).\r\n\r\nConcept NACK on this. There is no violation of a specification here, so assigning a misbevariour score is dangerous: it could result in honest nodes banning each other, leaving the network more vulnerable to partition attacks.\r\n\r\nThere is no DoS risk here either. BIP133 is a way to save bandwidth for our peers, by helpfully telling them that we're going to ignore transactions with a too low fee anyway, so they don't need to bother sending it. But clearly if they had transactions that were higher fee, we'd be prepared to process them. The question you have to ask yourself is if this is an effective way for an attacker to abuse our resources, and the answer is: if they wanted to attack they could construct (invalid) high-fee transactions just as well, and we'd be processing those anyway.\r\n\r\nLonger term, I think the correct way to deal with resource usage attacks is keeping track of what resources we spend on behalf of every peer, and if we run, deprioritize processing messages from them.",
