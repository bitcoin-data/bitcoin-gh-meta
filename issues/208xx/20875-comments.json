Changes that span the entire tree are also discouraged.\r\n\r\nI think your changes look okay in themselves, except one inside `leveldb`. That's a subtree, changes to third-party libraries should go to their upstream repository unless there's a strong reason to deviate from theirs.\r\n\r\n> What do you think? - Worth caring about / merging, or best to close a PR for such minor an optimisation?\r\n\r\nI can't give this an concept ACK.\r\n",
