   "body" : "This PR enables validation dry-runs of packages through the `testmempoolaccept` RPC. The expectation is that the results returned from `testmempoolaccept` are what you'd get from test-then-submitting each transaction individually, in that order (this means the package is expected to be sorted in topological order, for now at least). The validation is also atomic: in the case of failure, it immediately halts and may return \"unfinished\" `MempoolAcceptResult`s for transactions that weren't fully validated. The API for 1 transaction stays the same.\r\n\r\n**Motivation:** \r\n- This allows you to test validity for transaction chains (e.g. with multiple spending paths and where you don't want to broadcast yet); closes #18480.\r\n- It's also a first step towards package validation in a minimally invasive way.\r\n- The RPC commit happens to close #21074 by clarifying the \"allowed\" key.\r\n\r\nThere are a few added restrictions on the packages, mostly to simplify the logic for areas that aren't critical to main package use cases:\r\n- No package can have conflicts, i.e. none of them can spend the same inputs, even if it would be a valid BIP125 replacement.\r\n- The package cannot conflict with the mempool, i.e. RBF is disabled.\r\n- The total count of the package cannot exceed 25 (the default descendant count limit), and total size cannot exceed 101KvB (the default descendant size limit).\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for review comments and github isn't loading them, I have a gist compiling some topics of discussion [here](https://gist.github.com/glozow/c3acaf161c95bba491fce31585b2aaf7)\r\n",
