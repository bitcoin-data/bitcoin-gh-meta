These are extremely minor micro-optimisations, so feel free to just close the issue based on that.\r\n\r\nPS: There are also a number of other minor optimisations whence elements are individually `push_back`ed in succession, that could be replaced through a trivial [`vector::insert`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/insert) of a list (brace) initialisation.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? - Worth caring about / merging, or best to close a PR for such minor an optimisation?",
