That's fine for code gurus, but what about the average users (me included) who don't have a clue what \"bashing\" & \"looping scripts\" are - how would they apply the fix?\r\nThe wallets aren't \"broken\" per-se, they are what was supplied for download & worked perfectly at the time. Code changes in releases since then are the problem because devs didn't fully check for backwards compatibility then ignored the issue when it was discovered over 20 months ago. this needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency & a fully tested & working fix applied, not just because I & a few others can't access their funds or use their wallets - but because there will be many more people running into the same problem very soon.\r\nThe lamestream media will have a field day if this gets out - I can see the headline now:  Early Bitcoin adopters locked out of wallets - devs unmoved.\r\nReally, this has gone on for far too long already.",

      "body" : "In 0.21.0rc5, go to the debug console and do `upgradewallet`. That should fix the problem. **You must create a new backup after upgrading.**\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIt looks like the cause of this problem is having a wallet version that is supposed to be HD split, but not having an hd seed in the wallet. You can tell because the wallet version is greater than 139900, but there is no `hdseedid` in the `getwalletinfo` output. So how did this happen?\r\n\r\nIn 0.17, we allowed the `-upgradewallet` option to upgrade a non-HD wallet to HD. This would set the version number to something that actually supports HD, HD split, and pre-split keypool. This upgrade would first increase the wallet version number, and then generate the new hd seed. However the hd seed would fail to generate for encrypted wallets and the software would crash at this point. But the new version number would already be written to the wallet file. Subsequent use of that wallet would make the software think it can support HD split even though it doesn't actually. Because of that, it would try to fetch keys from the empty internal keypool and additionally fail the check for whether new keys could be generated, thus causing the error you see.\r\n\r\nThe check for whether new keys were generated depended on either the wallet version saying it is non-HD, or for there to be a HD seed. Since the wallet version purports to be HD and there is no HD seed, this would fail. The only reason you could still get new addresses and receive Bitcoin is because the keypool is big.\r\n\r\nThis should be resolved by 0.21 now supporting upgrading encrypted wallets.  This upgrade will generate a HD seed for wallets that should be supporting HD based on the version number but do not currently have a seed (this is a side effect of how the upgrade works). However because your wallet will be believed to already support the split keypool, the pre-split keypool will not be used so **a new backup must be created after upgrading**. After the upgrade, all newly fetched change addresses will come from the newly generated HD seed.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nTo replicate this issue, create a non-HD wallet using 0.15.2 or older. Encrypt that wallet. Using any version 0.17 - 0.20 inclusive, do `-upgradewallet`. The wallet will then have the same issue as described. `getrawchangeaddress` should fail. Using 0.21+, unlock the wallet and do `upgradewallet`. `getrawchangeaddress` should now work.",
