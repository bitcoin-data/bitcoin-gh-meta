I tried to turn this into a simple one-liner as well (something like ``git log --merges --format=\"- \\`%h\\` %s (%an)\" v0.16.0..v0.16.1``), but it didn't seem to capture everything I needed.\r\n\r\nWould it be worthwhile **wumpus** open-sourcing his code into `contrib/devtools` so there is no single point of failure (even if it can manually be worked around).",
