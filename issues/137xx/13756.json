   "body" : "Add a new wallet flag called `avoid_reuse` which, when enabled, will keep track of when a specific destination has been spent from, and will actively \"blacklist\" any new UTXOs which send to an already-spent-from destination.\r\n\r\nThis improves privacy, as a payer could otherwise begin tracking a payee's wallet by regularly peppering a known UTXO with dust outputs, which would then be scooped up and used in payments by the payee, allowing the payer to map out (1) the inputs owned by the payee and (2) the destinations to which the payee is making payments.\r\n\r\nThis replaces #10386 and together with the (now merged) #12257 it addresses #10065 in full. The concerns raised in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10386#issuecomment-302361381 are also addressed due to #12257.\r\n\r\n~~Note: this builds on top of #15780.~~ (merged)",
