   "body" : "This PR adds the ability to bootstrap another node from an existing datadir.\r\n\r\nTo fire up a new node with access to an existing node's datadir `y`, you would simply do\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ bitcoind -datadir=x -masterdatadir=y\r\n```\r\n\r\n(presumably permanently in `bitcoin.conf`) and it would use the blocks files from the former up until it needed to change something, at which point it would copy. (See accompanying test.)\r\n\r\nIt currently only supports `blocks/blk*` caching, which is implemented as copy-on-write. Due to limitations in LevelDB, the `chainstate` and `blocks/index` dirs are copied to `-datadir` on first launch. Latter is only ~75 MB, but former is ~4 GB, so this is sad but better than nothing.\r\n\r\nNote: the `feature_masterdatadir.py` test makes ~150 MB of block data. May want to combine this with the pruning tests to not redo the work of mining, but it is in its own test for now. Also may wanna move it to extended, but keeping it in base while this PR is ongoing.\r\n",
