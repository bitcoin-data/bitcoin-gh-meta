      "body" : "The only cryptographic code written in assembly is the sse4 1-way variable-length SHA256 code introduced in #10821, and that's what `--disable-asm` controls. The newer optimized code (introduced in #13191, #13393, and #13386) is written in C++ with intrinsics.\r\n\r\nI don't mind changing the scope of `--disable-asm` to include these as well, but perhaps it should be renamed. The original reason for allowing the asm code to be disabled was that it was introduced relatively late in the 0.16 release cycle, and very hard to review. Those arguments don't apply as much to the intrinsics based code, I believe.\r\n\r\nThinking about it - apart from reviewability - are there any reasons you'd want to disable these? If there are concerns about their correctness, we shouldn't be building by default in releases. If there aren't, we should probably just remove the compile flag.",
