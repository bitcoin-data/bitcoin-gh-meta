We will then (possibly) get a response including everything up to, but not including, the new block, but which the peer will not re-announce to us, delaying us from getting the new block from that peer (though unlikely to be an issue as we should receive the announcement from one of our non-CB-HB peers in an announcement that we can handle).",

Perhaps we should step back a bit and try to imagine what the protocol and synchronization state machines would look like if we wrote it from scratch, then see if that informs us about the direction we should take what we have.\r\n\r\nFor example, would be have headers responses that included blocks we haven't validated yet but could serve to those who want them?",
