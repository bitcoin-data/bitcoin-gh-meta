But (as mentioned above), the only thing the GUI currently lets you do with the rbf checkbox is to bump the transaction fee later on. So the idea of this PR is to help the user make the connection between the rbf checkbox and the bumpfee command. \r\n\r\nIf it's likely that more rbf functionality gets added to the GUI in the forseeable future, I'd say a relatively generic label (like \"mark as replaceable\", \"mark as final\") would be best, but for now I'd mention fees either way, since it's the only visible effect the checkbox currently has (i.e enables bumpfee, and gives you a lower estimate)  ",
