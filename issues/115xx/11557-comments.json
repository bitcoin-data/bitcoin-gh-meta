Switching to weight would be confusing - would we be talking about satoshi/weightbyte?\r\n\r\nThis [fee estimation article](https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_wallet_dev/#transaction-fee-estimation) is also useful.\r\n\r\n\"Virtual size in bytes\" has the additional benefit of being more intuitive than \"weight units\" in a UI.\r\n\r\nDo I understand correctly that the current fee estimator doesn't use `vsize` yet? Changing that sounds a bit too daunting for me at this point. I can open a separate issue / PR, once `vsize` is implemented, to suggest using Sat / Virtual Byte.",
