   "body" : "@sdaftuar pointed out that the version in #11487 was somewhat DoS-able as someone could feed you a valid chain that forked off the the last checkpoint block and force you to do lots of work just walking backwards across blocks for each new block they gave you. We came up with a few proposals but settled on the one implemented here as likely the simplest without obvious DoS issues. It uses our existing on-load mapBlockIndex walk to make sure everything that descends from an invalid block is marked as such, and then simply caches blocks which we attempted to connect but which were found to be invalid. To avoid DoS issues during IBD, this will need to depend on #11458.\r\n\r\nIncludes tests from #11487.",
