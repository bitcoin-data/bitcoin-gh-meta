I'm hesitant to spend more time reviewing these kinds of changes than they take to write. It was also unclear if bits returned 63 or 64 on 1<<63, and I ultimately wrote a test to check.  It's easy to introduce bugs with changes like this, and hard to review them to be absolutely sure. Sorry for the distraction there.",
