In particular ssize_t has been defined multiple times as I'm not familiar enough with the design to know the best location.\r\n\r\nThe changes may also break the non-msvc build, although that risk is reduced by using pre-compiler directives where possible. Travis will provide the initial answer to that question.  ",
