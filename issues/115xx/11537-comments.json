I think having a minimum for each network as the default is a good idea. Right now, besides using addnode, the only method for reliably connecting over TOR is the onlynet=onion option, however this removes most of benefits I mentioned in the first comment, as our node no longer is a bridge - it uses only TOR connections, and that is a completely different use-case.\r\nBesides, there are comparatively few people running nodes, they want accessible over both IP and TOR, so the default behaviour, not using them to their full potential - as bridges between networks, is I think a waste. The people running these nodes, may not even know, that they are not connecting to TOR at all, because by chance, they got to only the IP part of bitcoin network. I wanted to set up such node, and just looked at getnetworkinfo, only later I realised that I had no TOR connections, when i ran getpeerinfo. (Obviously, this is not as big of an issue for listening nodes with 100s of connections)",
