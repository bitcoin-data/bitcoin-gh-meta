You can check your path with:\r\n\r\n`echo $PATH`\r\n\r\nYou can further test by setting a minimal path for your current bash session and then retry the depends make script. To do so type the line below on your bash console:\r\n\r\n`PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin`",
