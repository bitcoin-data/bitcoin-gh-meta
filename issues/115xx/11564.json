   "body" : "Currently the send screen displays the fee in terms of (Î¼/m)BTC/kB, depending on a global preference. When entering a custom fee the user can select (Î¼/m)BTC using a dropdown. The resulting numbers are quite hard to read, often with five leading zeros.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"589\" alt=\"schermafbeelding 2017-10-26 om 18 06 10\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/32047392-62ff7c5a-ba78-11e7-9505-a08580e7e7a3.png\">\r\n\r\nThis makes it too easy to make an off-by-ten mistake, especially because the wallet doesn't display fiat values.\r\n\r\nI think Sat per Virtual Byte (vByte?) makes for more readable numbers. People generally find numbers between 0.01 and 100 easy to work with, because they're used to cents and dollars. Several fee estimators currently use Sat/vByte, where 1 is the minimum relay fee, 10-100 is the usual range, people start complaining when it goes over.\r\n\r\nI also think this choice is quite durable, even if the price increases by orders of magnitude and fees get worse (low fees would not really be a UX issue). Assuming fees in dollar terms stay in the same range, or even a factor ten more, Sat/vByte produces easy to read numbers for a price range of $500 (100 - 1000 sat/vByte) to $5 million (0.01 - 0.10 sat/vByte).\r\n\r\nIn this case the (Î¼/m)BTC dropdown could be removed from the fee UI; I don't think the users currency preference (Î¼BTC / mBTC / BTC) should be applied to the fee UI. This preference makes sense for the users balance, for a transaction amount and the absolute fee value.\r\n\r\nThere would still some confusion if people look at other fee estimators on the web which currently often user fee per byte, based on non-segwit transactions.\r\n\r\nHopefully the industry will trend towards a single metric for fees, so people can develop an intuition for them, decreasing the likeliness of mistakes.\r\n\r\nI can make a PR is people think this is a good idea.",
