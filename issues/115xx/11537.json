   "body" : "### FEATURE REQUEST\r\n\r\nCurrently, when a bitcoin node is set up with a connection to both TOR and normal IPv4/6 internet, the 8 outbound-only connection slots, almost always get filled with nodes connecting over IP.\r\nAdding a config option, which would try to ballance these connections based on what kind of network they go through, would be benefficial in many ways:\r\n\r\n1. It would add edges between bitcoin network on TOR and normal internet, reducing delays, and the risks associated with an attacker isolating a part of TOR-bitcoin-network from the rest of the world\r\n(Or an ISP/government man-in-the-middling all the normal IP connections)\r\n\r\n2. It would help hide/annonymise normal user's transactions from his/her ISP, by mixing them with TOR-outbound ones\r\n\r\n3. It would reduce the stress on normal general purpose TOR exit nodes, as users would more likely/reliably connect to TOR-IPv4/6 bitcoin nodes instead of exiting into normal internet first, and then connecting to default IPv4/6-only bitcoin nodes\r\n\r\nI understand it is possible to create such bridges already, by forcing connections to TOR-only nodes, or by just running a node with lots of inbound slots, but I think the proposed option, would greatly increase the number of such relays, and remove the need for user to maintain a TOR-node whitelist, by handing this work off to normal bitcoind connection finding algorithm.\r\n\r\nThis could be implemented as a minimum number of connections for each network, or just a simple evening boolean switch. (Which could be enabled by default for bitcoind installs with TOR connectivity)\r\n\r\nIn the future, if bitcoin was to support a new network type (for example cjdns/I2P/GNUnet), this option would help establish a presence on the new network faster\r\n\r\nbitcoind: 0.15",
