In order for them to be really effective and provide the kind of guarantees we want they need to be listed everywhere the function which needs the annotation is declared, not just ate the definition. I'd rather we leave them out than add them just to function declarations. The annotations are going to be highly infective for things like cs_main - they're gonna propagate backwards through the callstack pretty deep, but that's ok, its how it should be. We shouldn't avoid it, just gotta take the dive (though preferably not in this PR, please, lets just get this one merged).",
