Since you seem to be inactive (so much so that I can't even check out a repository to find your email address), is there any way you'd consider releasing the username? You can reach me directly at heatherjaybillings at gmail. Thanks, and sorry for spamming an old pull request thread!\n",

      "body" : "Sorry for bringing up such an old issue - but I've run into a situation probably very similar to @tarbell here.  It would be very handy to allow verifying messages without the need to specify an address explicitly.\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell said in an [even older issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1356#issuecomment-5794211) that it would be handy to allow `verifymessage` to work optionally without an explicit address.\r\n\r\nWhat is the current take on this?  I understand that having a separate `extractpubkey` RPC call is mostly a maintenance burden as stated by @laanwj above.  But what about modifying `verifymessage` in a way that allows it to return the address?  For instance, if an empty address is passed, it could return a JSON object like this:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"valid\": True,\r\n      \"address\": <address>\r\n    }\r\n\r\ninstead of just a boolean.  Doing so would be very simple (just a few lines of code) and thus not have much of a maintenance burden at all.  I can do that specifically for my own application, but I wonder if it would make sense to implement this in Bitcoin Core directly (so others can make use of it as well).",
