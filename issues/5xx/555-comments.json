This is not the case for poolserverj and wouldn't be for any pool engine that uses multiple bitcoin daemons.\n3/ If indeed it isn't windows incompatible that's another negative from poolserverj's side since it can run as a windows service.  There is at least small pool using it on windows.\n\nThe principal is good and definitely desirable from a pool engine's perspective, it's just the method of sending the signal that is limiting.\n\npoolserverj currently uses an intermediary mini-daemon (written in C) that listens for signals then sends a signal over a network socket.  This is a very simple but custom protocol.  Open socket, send a \\n terminated string [passphrase]:[bitcoind id string] then close socket.  This is pretty hackish so I'd be open to an alternative but I think a network based notification method would be preferable for the above reasons.  \n\nperhaps in keeping with the json-rpc trend \nPerhaps -blknotifycallbackurl=<listenUrl> with a json-rpc method: notifyblockchange <blocknumber>\n",

Once you implement a 1/2 arsed \nsolution that satisfies some people it becomes that much harder to get \nsupport for a complete solution.  The few that were satisfied by the 1/2 \nsolution no longer care because their needs are met which leaves the \nremaining unsupported people to argue for the change on their own.\n\nYou're calling these complicated solutions but I honestly can't see \nwhat's hard about it.  Both probably require an extra line or two of \ncode to parse the arguments.  And probably one or two more to execute \nthe rpc call or script.  The rest is already done.\n\nWhy is executing an external script so complex for this application when \nyou seem perfectly ok with it in your coinbaser patch?  That is a far \nmore complex use of external scripts since it involves waiting on the \nreturned output and parsing it.  This is simply a 'fire and forget' case.\n\nAs I've said if SIGUSR1 is important to you there's no reason you \ncouldn't send the signal at the same time.  But the rest of the work is \ndone already so it's only these few lines of code to be added and all \npotential consumers of the service are satisfied.\n\nLet me break it down for you...\n\nSIGUSR1:\n- 75% of pool hash power is excluded from benefiting.  + more for \n  those that don't run bitcoind on the same machine as pushpool.\n- limited to one event type per target pid.\n- Those that are able to use it already do.\n- Specific to one and only one use case\n\nScript/RPC\n- Easily backwards compatible (script calls 'kill' or RPC has side by \n  side SIGUSR1 option)\n- 100% of pools can benefit\n- extensible to many use cases that are non-pool related.\n- cross-platform, cross-machine\n- perhaps 4 extra lines of code within existing patch.\n  -\n",
