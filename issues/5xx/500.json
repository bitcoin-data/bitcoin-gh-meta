   "body" : "Thanks to Pieter for the detective work finding this.\n\nBug was a deadlock when the process-messages-thread and the IRC thread were adding peer addresses at the same time.\n\nI inspected the code for any other cases where starting a database transaction might trigger this type of bug, and all other cases are OK.  I'll keep thinking about how to get the DEBUG_LOCKORDER code to detect this in the future.\n\nTested by running bitcoind, letting it connect and startup (and join an IRC channel), then shutting it down repeatedly (10 times in a row) and observing no deadlocks.\n",
