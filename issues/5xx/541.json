   "body" : "This adds initial support for three new types of transactions:\n  (a and b)\n  (a or b)\n  (a and b) or c\n\n... where a/b/c are keys. These new transaction types will enable better wallet security and backup in future versions of bitcoin.\n\nI've taken a conservative approach with this initial pull; the new transaction types will be relayed and included in blocks, but are ignored by the wallet code, so will not affect the balance and will never be considered available to spend.  I'm going to start a discussion on bitcoin-dev to do a bit of a brain-dump on what NOT to do with multi-signature transactions (there are several potential attacks that we'll need to be careful to avoid).\n\nI'll be creating a multisig_testing branch in the gavinandresen github fork that WILL add multisig transactions to the balance, will have a new RPC call to create multisig transactions, and will be able to spend the multisig transactions; that will be for testing this PULL only for now.\n",
