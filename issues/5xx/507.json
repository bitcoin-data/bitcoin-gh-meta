The error gets displayed, \"Error: This transaction requires a transaction fee of at least 0.001 because of its amount, complexity, or use of recently received funds.\"  Clicking okay is the only option. The send window disappears and the user is returned to the main window.\n\nExpected Behavior: After being shown the error the user should be returned back to the send dialog box. That way the user doesnt have to re-enter the recipient address and amount over again. The user can just subtract the fee from the amount, and click send.\n",
