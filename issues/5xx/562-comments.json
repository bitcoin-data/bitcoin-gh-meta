And I agree with laanwj RE: optimizing HexStr instead.\n\nBut I'll go back to my original question:  does this have any measurable effect on performance if the bypass-JSON-and-return-a-cached-response-to-getwork patch is applied?  What is the performance of getwork with/without:\n  Just this patch\n  Just the bypass-JSON-cache-getwork patch\n  Both this AND the cache-getwork patch\n\nI think it is a bad idea to add another (potentially unsafe if you use it wrong!) way of converting to hex, unless it gives a really significant (on the order of \"you can serve twice as many getwork requests with one bitcoind\") performance advantage.\n",
