And as long as it will come online again before the next release, there's absolutely no point in removing it just to add it again.\n\nIf the seed would be gone forever this would be another issue, but as it seem it will be back up in a few days.\n",

That would result in a lot of git diff chatter :) If it was down for months at a time, I would agree with you and remove the seed.\n\nMaybe someone should write a document with requirements for DNS seeds. But having 99% uptime is not one of those. Due to the nature of P2P networks I'd rather have more, sometimes unreliable DNS seeds than a few very-reliable ones.\n",
