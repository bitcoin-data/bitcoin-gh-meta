Some of the messages sent there are periodic, and necessary even if nothing was received in a while (for example sending pings). So you'll need something like:\n\n```\nif (!condMessageHandler.timed_wait(lock, boost::posix_time::milliseconds(5000)))\n  break;\n```\n\ninstead (which never blocks for more than 5 seconds).\n",

I guess CCondition is a bit too general as a name.\nCTimeoutCondition maybe?\n\nAlso, the code that I gave above may not work if the waiting is regularly\nwoken up spuriously (which the spec says can happen). The timed wait would\nneed to decrement the timeout based on how much time passed in previous\nloops.\n\n> Something else that would be nice to have is a global message queue for\n> new messages that need to be processed.

Also, we need per-node resource tracking (how\nmuch of the receive buffer is one peer using?).\n",

I think in its current state, the patch will not trickle at the same rate.  The two options I could think of were either having a separate thread for trickling, or tracking a \"last trickle\" timestamp in ThreadMessageHandler and using that to calculate how long to do the timed_wait() for so that it wakes up at least once every 100ms.\n",

The other 75% of transactions will be delayed and pushed into the vInvWait queue which will only be sent to each peer when they are randomly chosen as the trickle node.  So as a transaction propagates through the network, there might be some unlucky nodes who don't get any peers instantly relaying it to them, so they have to wait for 1 or more trickle hops before they see it.  There might even be nodes who have to wait 2 or more trickle hops to see it.  So I believe having a low trickle interval should ensure fast worst-case propagation.  Fast propagation of unconfirmed transactions should be important for responsiveness when making a payment (eg. PoS or online checkout).\n",

      "body" : "I have done an audit to find events that should require SendMessages() to run:\n- CNode::fPingQueued set (ping())\n- CNode::vAddrToSend pushed (CNode::PushAddress())\n- CNodeState::fShouldBan set (Misbehaving())\n- CNodeState::rejects pushed (InvalidBlockFound())\n- CNode::fStartSync set (StartSync())\n- CNode::vInventoryToSend pushed (CNode::PushInventory())\n- CNodeState::nBlocksInFlight decreased (MarkBlockAsReceived())\n- CNode::mapAskFor pushed (CNode::AskFor())\n\nSo I will patch those to wake up ThreadMessageHandler().\n\nHowever, there is a problem in that SendMessages() is not guaranteed to do all the work required of it.  If it fails its TRY_LOCK on cs_main, it only sends pings, and postpones sending of all other message types until its next invocation when cs_main can \"hopefully\" be obtained.  So there is already going to be the possibility of messages being delayed for arbitrary lengths of time - not good.\n\nGiven that SendMessages() doesn't guarantee sending, it is not going to be enough to just fire it once per relevant event and sleep inbetween.  SendMessages() needs to be called regularly so that it can re-try on cs_main and send any pending messages that were previously postponed.  Furthermore, SendMessages() is responsible for stalled peer detection which is not really event-based, so that also requires SendMessages() to be called at least somewhat regularly.\n\nGiven this need to run regularly, the timed_wait() in ThreadMessageHandler going to be strictly required rather than acting as a safety net, and the sleep time should probably be kept low.\n\nIn order to have a better guarantee on propagation times, I think SendMessages() should always send all outgoing messages every time it is invoked, ideally without requiring cs_main at all.  It currently needs cs_main to call IsInitialBlockDownload() and obtain the CNodeState information.  As discussed in #4493, IsInitialBlockDownload could be modified to not require the lock.  But, cs_main would still be needed for sending rejection messages, banning peers, and requesting blocks.  Delaying the banning/rejection messages is probably not too bad, but it would be good if requests for blocks were not delayable.\n",

It could at least do a shorter timed wait when the lock failed, and a longer one when it succeeds.  The longer one is needed so that it can still do stalled peer detection.  However, there is an added complexity: each time ThreadMessageHandler wakes up, it does many calls to SendMessages() - once for each individual peer.  So what should it do if, say, the lock failed for only 1 out of the N peers?\n",

I don't think the message handler currently spends much time without the lock anyway.\n\nThe only difference is that there wouldn't be a gap inbetween calls for other threads to obtain cs_main.  If that's a problem, it could perhaps acquire the lock, then do SendMessages for the first 10 peers, then free the lock, then reacquire, do the next 10 peers, etc.\n\nWhat do you think about that?  The good thing about doing it that way is that messages won't have any chance of being \"delayed\".\n\nFrom my work on the peers GUI, I recall that cs_main was actually often in use.  I was doing TRY_LOCK on it every second, and it would fail maybe 20% of the time, even when my node wasn't very busy.  In the case of having to run through 120 peers, I bet at least one of them would fail most of the time.\n",

For example the GUI can appear to hang on some actions if the main lock is held for too long. I'm not sure if the network thread will hold the lock for long, though. The longest main-lock holders have always been wallet rescanning and some block processing.\n",

It does produce a \"potential deadlock\" warning though, because I guess the deadlock detection doesn't know that the 2nd lock is conditional on try_lock().\n\nWhat I mean about ThreadMessageHandler is that I think it already spends most of its _waking_ time with cs_main, but agreed that its not much time overall.  So if it acquired cs_main upon wakeup and freed it before sleeping, this would allow all pending messages to be sent every time rather than randomly failing for some peers, causing arbitrary message delays.\n\nSo what about either, acquiring once, processing all SendMessages, then releasing.  Or, acquiring and releasing in batches, doing X peers at a time?\n",

      "body" : "We think that removing trickling will definitely make Bitcoin less anonymous for non-Tor users. The attack has three (independent) parts:\n1) Linking a user's IP address to his entry nodes (his 8 outgoing connections). Possible only if Tor is not used.\n2) Correlating transactions to entry nodes.\n3) Linking together transactions of the same user  during one session.\n\nThe trickling delay for 75% of transactions considerably decreases the rate of linkability for the transactions, i.e. parts 2) and 3).  Without trickling the success rate of these parts would significantly increase (probably would become close to perfect). Thus linking different transactions of the same user during the session would be much easier. Moreover for parts 2) and 3) the attacker would need to make only 1 connection to each peer, instead of 20-50 in the current attack. This is much less noticeable. Also Tor is easy to ban in the current protocol.\n\nAs possible countermeasures we are considering now would be to\n1) increase the percentage of trickled transactions (from 75% to 90%, this is of course not in the spirit of this pull request, and will increase tx propagation delays);\n2) decrease the number of outgoing connections from 8 to 3    (this has an implication that the network becomes less connected).\n\nMinor thought: Not having privacy issues in mind and completely relying on an external tool (Tor) might cause that anonymity is not achieved at all (https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TBBFlash)\n\nAlex, Ivan\nhttps://www.cryptolux.org\n",

      "body" : "@sipa @laanwj Please take a look at my latest commit if you get a chance.  It's doing what I described above - splitting SendMessages() into two functions and requiring the lock for one of them.\n\nThere is the potential to move the sending of non-block getdata messages into the lockless function, but that would cause 2 getdata messages to be sent (1 getdata for blocks, another getdata for non-blocks) when the old code would combine them into one.  So I've left all getdata messages in the locked function to keep the protocol behaviour unchanged.\n\nIf you don't like this approach, I can revert it and look at some of the alternatives discussed earlier.\n\nPS: I've observed that when this patch is applied, ThreadTrickle() ends up running only a few times per second during times when cs_main is busy (eg. when validating a new block), instead of the target 10 times per second.  This is nothing new though, because the existing code is already effected in the same way: it would run 10 times per second, but 8 of those times its TRY_LOCK on cs_main would fail so no messages would be trickled.\n",

If there are some parts of SendMessages logic that do not rely on cs_main, that means that code shouldn't have been in main in the first place. And net certainly shouldn't know about or use cs_main itself.\n\nHow about moving the non-cs_main-dependent part of SendMessages to net.cpp (sort of as a base message handler, independent of the validation engine), and register it as a second SendMessages handler?\n",

      "body" : "@sipa Thanks for checking it out.  It felt like a kludgy hack as I was doing it, but I wanted to get the concept into code.  That sounds like a much better way to do it.  As for having two handlers on SendMessages, I don't know how I would be able to batch up the cs_main-dependent work to run under one acquisition of the lock.  I'd have to acquire cs_main inside the main.ccp SendMessages handler, once for each peer.  I figured it would be better to get the lock once and do all the work at once.  Do you think it's going to add any/much overhead to be acquiring and releasing it up to 125 times every time the handler fires?\n",

I was looking for places in the code that changed any state that would cause new messages to send next time SendMessages() runs.  But upon thinking about this further, most of the times when that state is changed, it's happening during ProcessMessage(), which is always followed by SendMessages() anyway, so it looks like most of those can be removed.  In the other cases, it might not be so important, like when an RPC 'ping' command is issued, maybe it's fine to wait until the next ThreadMessageHandler run (max 1 second) to send the pings.\n\nHowever there is one event that I think is important to wake up on, which is PushInventory().  This gets called from ActivateBestChain() when we have a new block.  To speed up propagation time, it should wake the message handler immediately so that it can send the INVs out to all peers right away.\n\nRe: the separate trickle thread, both options were considered and I ended up [taking advice from @laanwj](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4230#issuecomment-48292633) to have a new thread.\n",

This means that the current (in this PR) code from main.cpp's SendMessages will be split up over two functions, which potentially run in parallel (so all data structures shared between them need locking).\n",
