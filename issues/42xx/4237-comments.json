For example, find out which maps are never iterated over at all.\n\nIn general if you want to improve performance I recommend to first profile before going on a wild goose chase. If we don't have concrete statistics that map lookups/insertions are a bottleneck anywhere, it may be wasted time to go over everything. In my profiles using valgrind here-and-there I don't remember seeing map functions anywhere near the top.\n\nAlso unordered_map is new in C++11. We don't use C++11 yet. Boost also has an unordered_map which should be interface-compatible with the C++11 one (TR1), which can be used in the meantime.\n",

If the cache were split up in a dirty and a pure-cache part, it could even automatically discard non-dirty entries, until a given % of the cache is dirty, at which you flush. (instead of the current behaviour of flushing everything when the cache gets too large, and then dropping everything).\n",
