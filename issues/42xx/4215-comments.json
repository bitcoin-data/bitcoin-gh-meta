      "body" : "@theuni Yes, the getaddrinfo_a() call does kick off a new thread for resolving the name and poll on it in its own thread.  So when there is one resolving job, there would be one more thread than before this change.\n\nHowever, the real name resolving job happens mostly, if not only, in dnsseed thread.  To all other calls to the LookupIntern() function, they are generally kicked off by the constructor of CNetAddr which actually just want to convert a string address into a network address structure, and this kind of job, which is not a real name resolving one, can be done without getaddrinfo(), but a lighter inet_aton().  By detecting this case, we can dramatically reduce the overhead of getaddrinfo(), and in general there should be only one more thread and only when dnsseed thread is running.\n\nWill submit a patch for this PR according to the above soon.\n\nFor the global resolver idea, one thing need to pointed out is that it doesn't reduce the thread count but add one (the global resolver itself) instead, while it is extremely helpful for the throughput if there were lots of _real async_ name resolving jobs kicked off simultaneously and the kickers don't need the result immediately.  But as mentioned above, the dnsseed seems the only one needs the result of a real name resolving, and it works in a sync manner, so the global resolver doesn't help here.  Actually why we switch to a async getaddrinfo_a() is just for responsiveness purpose but not throughput.  We can absolutely rewrite the dnsseed thread to let it work in an async manner and improve its throughput, but given it's only running for several minutes, or tens of minutes if the network situation is really bad, before exiting, it doesn't worth the effort I guess.  Or maybe later if we figure out the effort is really needed.\n",
