That's hard to control.\n\nThinking about it, as you have an explicit MarkDirty() (in contrast to one that is called with high frequency on every change), we could make that compute the hash. That'd make race issues more controllable -- you'd just have to make sure no two threads are updating a transaction (and calling subsequent MarkDirty) at the same time.\n(i also don't think it would give extra overhead - one of the things that gets called for sure on a transaction is GetHash, if only to put it in a map of some kind)\n",

It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3.
