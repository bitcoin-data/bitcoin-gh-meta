   "body" : "This addresses some (but not all) of the issues in #4185. It cleans up a\nfew things in release-process.md (such as indents) and makes the\ndescriptors more consistent, in terms of style and also naming (both of\nthe descriptors and the intermediate inputs). This doesn't change any of\nthe actual build scripts, other than to change the file names -- I didn't\nwant to accidentally break anything, though it looks like there are a few\nthings that could be improved and made more consistent. The big change\nthat it would be nice if someone were to make is to switch the OS X\nintermediates from tarballs to zips for more consistency. I didn't do\nthat, because I don't know the details of how tar and zip/unzip work on\nthe command line, especially when it comes to determinism.\n",
