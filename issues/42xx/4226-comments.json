Using the current API you need to call gettxout for every input, sum their values and calculate the fee, all of which offer opportunity for mistakes. I'd expect frequent users of the current API write their own shell tools around bitcoin-cli to accomplish all that. Since bitcoind has all the available information and this is good practice before every signrawtransaction, I think it should be its own RPC.\r\n\r\nAs for adding the coinsview stuff to TxToJSON, I definitely agree with you from a code cleanliness perspective. It's an artifact of my initial approach to extend decoderawtransaction. I'll push a new commit which pulls the coinsview logic into the explainrawtransaction function call where it belongs.",

The general principle is \"don't make the situation worse\"\r\n\r\nTo be specific, the lock should ideally be only taken inside the mempool class, and the code is slowly being migrated in that direction.  We don't want to move in the opposite direction, do the \"ugly\" thing (take lock manually, touch mempool internals manually) without a good reason.\r\n\r\nThat means\r\n* Avoid adding new places outside CTxMemPool that take the mempool lock, and reach a hand into the mempool's internals.\r\n* If you find yourself needing to do that, then create a new method inside CTxMemPool class that satisfies the mempool manipulation or query you wish to accomplish.  That was the genesis of CTxMemPool::addUnchecked() and CTxMemPool::queryHashes().\r\n\r\nIs this PR a necessary exception to that general migration?\r\n",
