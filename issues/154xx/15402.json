   "body" : "This PR makes a number of improvements to the InvalidateBlock (`invalidateblock` RPC) and RewindBlockIndex functions, primarily around breaking up their long-term cs_main holding. In addition:\r\n* They're made safely interruptible (`bitcoind` can be shutdown, and no progress in either will be lost, though if incomplete, `invalidateblock` won't continue after restart and will need to be called again)\r\n* The validation queue is prevented from overflowing (meaning `invalidateblock` on a very old block will not drive bitcoind OOM) (see #14289).\r\n* `invalidateblock` won't bother to move transactions back into the mempool after 10 blocks (optimization).\r\n\r\nThis is not an optimal solution, as we're relying on the scheduler call sites to make sure the scheduler doesn't overflow. Ideally, the scheduler would guarantee this directly, but that needs a few further changes (moving the signal emissions out of cs_main) to prevent deadlocks.\r\n\r\nI have manually tested the `invalidateblock` changes (including interrupting, and running with -checkblockindex and -checkmempool), but haven't tried the rewinding (which is probably becoming increasingly unnecessary, as very few pre-0.13.1 nodes remain that would care to upgrade).",
