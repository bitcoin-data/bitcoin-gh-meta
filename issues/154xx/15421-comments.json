I'm not sure how this PR changes [existing behavior](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tor.md). For modern versions of Tor we automatically create a hidden service if the user is running Tor: \"if Tor is running (and proper authentication has been configured), Bitcoin Core automatically creates a hidden service to listen on\", but that's quite different from _starting_ Tor.",
