However, I tried to apply your suggested change and it didn't change the behavior for me (but I also have less populated peers.dat).\r\n> Did you try to apply this change?\r\n\r\nYeah, it worked fine for me, but I didn't try very hard, so getting 2 successes out of ~7 attempts might have just been good luck? I also added a LogPrintf in ThreadOpenConnections() to report outgoing connection attempts; duplicates a -debug=net log messasge, but was less noisy for quick debugging.\r\n\r\nI'm getting maybe 20% of outbound attempts succeeding, which if my maths isn't too far off says 8 attempts should be ~50% chance of 2 connections, 18 attempts should give 90% chance, 31 for 99%, and 40 for 99.9%. Though having now tried stopping and restarting a few times in quick succession, I'm getting higher success rates.\r\n\r\nMight be better to run a few extra threads that just try to connect to previously seen peers at startup to get reconnected to the network faster?",
