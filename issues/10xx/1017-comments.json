For new users I think it helps them see what's going on behind the scenes, how new change addresses are created for each spend, etc.  Maybe they don't care, but I would have appreciated this feature when I was first using the client.\n\nI don't see how it's easier to use multiple wallets.  Doesn't that involve maintaining multiple copies of the blockchain or running with -rescan whenever I switch wallets?  And running multiple instances of the client or having to keep shutting down and restarting the client with different datadirs?  Using coincontrol seems a lot easier to me.\n",

Where this money is stored, and how the wallet transactions are mapped to bitcoin transactions is entirely abstracted away. This makes starting to use it easier, but it's very confusing to people who want to learn what's going on beyond the scenes.\n\nI think the solution is both supporting multiple wallets in the client (and have actual \"open wallet\" -> choose file dialogs), as breaking the mapping abstraction for users who want it (this patch). It may not be used by everyone, but for those to whom it is important that they understand it, it's essential.\n",
