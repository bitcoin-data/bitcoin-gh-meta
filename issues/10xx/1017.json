   "body" : "I've updated coderrr's coincontrol patch #415 so it merges cleanly against v0.6.0, and also updated the coin selection refactor and change reduction changes and unit tests from patch #898.\n\nThey touch overlapping code, so I've merged them both here.\n\nhttps://github.com/dooglus/bitcoin/tree/coincontrol-v0.6.0 has just the coincontrol patch, without the other coin selection changes.\n\nI've improved the coincontrol patch, as follows:\n- it's much faster than coderrr's patch - what used to take over a minute now takes a fraction of a second\n- it's reformatted to use 4-space indents like the other bitcoin code\n- instead of showing the balance twice for each address, one with 0.0005 taken off, it now shows the total balance of each group\n- the groups are sorted so the most valuable group is shown first\n- the 'clear all' button on the 'send coins' tab clears the 'send from' input too\n",
