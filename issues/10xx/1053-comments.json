Given that it seems to be fairly standard on the internet these days, is there a good reason that bitcoin should _not_ support resume-able block downloads? Could at least there be an option feature that can be supported, such that if I create a fork that does support this, that there can be a way to identify other peers which support it, without adding to the already unnecessary traffic that this proposed patch intends to reduce? I'd like to explore this, and would be happy for it not to enter the master branch (even though I think it would be an overall advantage if it eventually did).\n",

My internet connection disconnects connections at around the 300kB mark, so a 1MB block is often a problem unless download it via tor. I won't be the only person world-wide with such a connection to the bitcoin network but who also wants to run a full-node. I think bitcoin should support such users, and have yet to hear an argument why they should be excluded. Are there any disadvantages to including the ability to resume block downloads, for example?\n",

This would allow it to be tested by a minority of nodes who use this feature, without impacting on the majority of nodes which do not use the feature. Would this be something you might consider as a way forward?\n\nI'd be willing to contribute to the coding of this, but would rather get an amber light first before putting too much effort into it...\n",

With the changes I've made to my fork, I'm now downloading the blockchain much faster, but it's very inefficient in terms of bandwidth due to often downloading the same block from many peers, and often the connection breaking before the block completes. My proposals would fix both these issues. I'm regularly getting a memory pool of 400 or so between block updates, so I think my node is contributing to the network fine for transactions so far, just not so well for blocks until these changes can be implemented. (By the way, there is still a bug in my fork where it loses track of \"block providers\" and doesn't getblocks as early as it should - stil to fix).\n",

In order to reduce the chances of blocks of the same size, it will limit the number of getdata blocks to a smaller number than the existing 500.\n",
