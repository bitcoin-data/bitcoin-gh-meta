There is a fork is at height 46722 until 47475 (753 block long)\n\nThe options I see for the fix:\n    - code fix only: a huge second fork at height 46739, need to redownload the blockchain for all clients.\n    - code fix + special case for blocks [46739-54673]: would create a second fork at height 54673,.\n    - code fix + testnet reset: i'm not sure how many clients will update. 53% probably won't, and some of the 47% in version>50300 probably won't. \n\nAre there any other reasons for a testnet reset? If not, I'm not sure it's the best option as I don't like to remove all these test case transactions. The fork of 500+ nodes is also a good test scenario. \n",
