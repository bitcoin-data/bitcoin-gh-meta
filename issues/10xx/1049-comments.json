We already want to move most of the initialization to another thread eventually, so it helps to split it to multiple parts. Arguments parsing should of course remain in the GUI (main) thread.\n\nSo I propose:\n- Add a HelpMessage() call to the Bitcoin core, that returns help text (it could return multiple texts of you want to split it into main/detailed)\n- Call it from bitcoin-qt when '-?' or '--help' option is provided (after the translators are loaded, probably before the splash screen shows)\n- Show the message box in any way you want\n\nThis also prevents having to add extra arguments to the ThreadSafeMessageBox call chain.\n",
