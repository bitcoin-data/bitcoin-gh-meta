(Is there a place for +1s on suggestions for improvement?). Sounds like this should be easy to implement. e.g. if one deletes the blk0001.dat but not the wallet.dat and runs the bitcoin client, they still see the transactions, etc, but simply don't have the block chain. This would be no different to that scenario, surely (except would only need to load it from disk rather than from the network).--- Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/1028#issuecomment-5188021\n",

In any case we should decide on things because they make sense, not because they are hip or not.\n\nIn any case, you're welcome to try. Big picture:\n\n1) You'll have to move the AppInit2 call to its own QThread\n\n2) This thread has to tell the UI thread (through Qt signals) when certain functionality becomes available, so that the WalletModel / ClientModel can be constructed and passed into BitcoinGUI at the appropriate time. \n2.1) When in init phase, the progress bar should be updated to display the current init message, and maybe give an indication how far the process is along.\n\n3) BitcoinGUI is designed so that it will work with the WalletModel / ClientModel set to NULL initially. However, it wlll display nonsense. An empty transaction list and balance, at the very least. This should be hidden / changed to a \"loading...\" message. An possibility would be to show the splash screen image (as it looks nicer than text) inside the interface when it's loading...\n",

Often, since I use linux, there are few system resets, so at startup is replaced with, \"I expect to use soon, start services\" or, otherwise always on. \n\nWhat I encounter, is a topmost splash the persists over all else, although normal actions not covered by the splash are still usable. \n",
