Adresse\"). That said, note that\nin version 0.6.3, the problem also occurs with English sentences, so\nIMHO the best way to fix the issue is to modify the geometry of the\nwindow (i.e. increase its width).\n\nInterestingly, I grabbed the tarball of revision 5fa8396 from github and\ncompiled it, and then I was surprised to see that the issue seemed to\nhave been fixed... until I realized I hadn't enabled QR Code support\nwith qmake. In short, with one less button, things look much better so\nincreasing the width of the window should do the trick.\n\nPS: As described on #1064 a very similar problem also occurs with the\nsplash screen image. A slightly bigger image appended to the bug report\nfixes the problem, so you may want to commit it until the splash screen\nis disabled entirely (rev 5fa8396 still has it).\n\n## \n\nOne man alone can be pretty dumb sometimes, but for real bona fide\nstupidity, there ain't nothin' can beat teamwork.--Edward Abbey\n",
