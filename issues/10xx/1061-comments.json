I will copy the current French translation and add it with no country code to make sure the issue will be resolved for the next version. Feel free to delete French (France) to make my life easier -- I'm the one who contributed it on Transifex so no worries about inconsistencies.\n\nMany thanks to gmaxwell and sipa for their help with compiling on IRC.\n\nDiapolo wrote:\n\n> This would be a good thing for all \"major\" translations, I dunno if there are more like the french one.\n\nYes, right now _at least_ Spanish, Portuguese and Greek (also spoken in Cyprus) are in the same case. Given possible particularities of each language, it would probably be a good idea to confirm this with respective translators and possibly add a guideline on Transifex advising to create a language with no country code if appropriate.\n",
