   "body" : "Hopefully this'll make everyone happy, and clarify some chainstate locking issues going forward.\r\n\r\n### Background \r\n\r\nThere is some amount of confusion due to my choice to conflate use of `cs_main` between\r\n- its original purpose: guarding legacy data structures related to CChainState-related data (i.e. pre-`ChainstateManager` coverage of `chainActive`), and\r\n- its new purpose: guarding *pointers* to the constituent CChainState instances managed by ChainstateManager, e.g. `m_ibd_chainstate`, `m_active_chainstate`.\r\n\r\nI initially thought that reusing cs_main would be a simplification, but it turned out to just be mostly confusing.\r\n\r\nAs a quick refresher, ChainstateManager manages two constituent CChainState instances (`m_ibd_chainstate`, `m_snapshot_chainstate`) and reveals a pointer to the one that is in active use (`m_active_chainstate`) per the assumeutxo semantics. As [@jnewbery has pointed out](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19806#issuecomment-768946522), the active pointer doesn't need to be guarded by a mutex, but can be marked `atomic` to avoid explicit locking.\r\n\r\nThroughout the course of [deglobalizing chainstate use](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158), @dongcarl has had to embed `cs_main` acquisitions in the active chainstate accessor functions (e.g. ::ChainstateActive()) to avoid the risk of unserialized access to the `ChainstateManager::m_active_chainstate` state. This is suboptimal because callers are almost always already holding cs_main anyway, so we just end up recursively acquiring the lock in many cases. And fundamentally, cs_main use isn't necessary for that once we decouple chainstate *pointer* management from cs_main.\r\n\r\n### These changes\r\n\r\n- make `ChainstateManager::m_active_chainstate` atomic to avoid requiring explicit locking (per @jnewbery's suggestion),\r\n- introduce `ChainstateManager::m_cs_chainstates` to relieve cs_main of guarding the internal chainstates managed by ChainstateManager,\r\n- remove the `cs_main` acquisitions in `::ChainstateActive()` and `ChainstateManager::ActiveChainstate()`, which are no longer necessary, and\r\n- annotate `CChainState::m_chain` as guarded by cs_main, which was an implicit requirement that I'm just making explicit here.",
