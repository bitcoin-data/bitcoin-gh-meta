Besides it looks outdated and unmaintained. May I ask you to confirm/deny my assumption?\r\n> \\<wumpus> hebasto: it is not used for anything, it exists to be able to edit the qt forms in qt designer nothing more\r\n> \\<wumpus> i'm not sure if it is even *necessary* for that, but it is why it is there\r\n> \\<hebasto> wumpus: thanks, qt designer does not need *.pro file at all\r\n> \\<hebasto> maybe qt creator does\r\n> \\<wumpus> feel free to create a PR to remove it, best way to find out if someone wants to keep it, you are right it hasn't been updated in a long time\r\n> \\<hebasto> ok\r\n> \\<wumpus> fwiw, the only question i get about it ever is why it exists\r\n> \\<hebasto> it was in use with `qmake` years ago (what I found digging into the repo history)\r\n> \\<wumpus> yes, that was the original reason, but when we switched to automake it was kept around for use w/ qt's GUI tools\r\n> \\<hebasto> I've noticed it in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blame/master/doc/translation_process.md#L25\r\n> \\<wumpus> what it says there is definitely not true anymore",
