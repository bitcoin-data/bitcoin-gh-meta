I don't understand why we test if `ToString()` output includes `%zone_index`: it clearly doesn't on some platforms, so we cannot rely on it anyways. Then why test it?\r\n> \r\n> 2.) And perhaps more fundamentally: why would we even _want_ to have `%zone_index` in our textual `ToString()` output? I think the expectation is to get say `fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a` (without zone index) and not say `fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a%eth2 ` or `fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a%3 `when doing `ipv6_addr.ToString()` :)",
