My second pull request doesn't stop the wobble, but it does reduce some cases where it would be revealed. The first pull request is the one I would suggest to stop the wobble altogether though.\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke  what are you objections to the first pull request please?  Why is it \"contraversial\"?  Where is the \"privacy loss\" that you claim it provides? And how it providing more privacy (which it does provide) not a \"significant benefit\"? Plus, reduced traffic also.",
