Reading though the discussion there, it seems that the way progress bars are animated changed in macOS 10.10. \r\nQt was patched [here (5.5+)](https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/112379/):\r\n> Disable progress bar animations on 10.10 Yosemite and higher - the native style does not animate them any more. Keep the indeterminate progress bar animation.\r\n\r\nGiven all of that, I don't think this is worth keeping around, as it would seem to only be useful in the case that a macOS user is compiling with a Qt < 5.5. That should be pretty unlikely, as we don't support downloaded Qt binaries, and brew currently provides [5.11.1](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/571b46213c70ca1573da6d0425b0bd6df34961ee/Formula/qt.rb).",
