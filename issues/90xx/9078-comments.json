I can identify the spent outputs via the address and amount.  The scriptPubKey may be correct as well.  It lists all my real unspent outputs as well, with correct txid and number of confirmations.  The sum of the unspent values from real transactions equals what getbalance reports without the argument, i.e. the real balance.

A rescan should correct the wallet inconsistencies (`bitcoind -rescan`; it will take a while). To prevent this kind of problem in the future, you should avoid sharing your wallet between bitcoin-core instances; you can transfer funds from one node to another with ordinary transactions. I also recommend finding an alternative to the built-in accounting system; it has been deprecated for some time and will be removed.\n",

Any 'account' that shows up as non-zero has a new deposit. I then 'move' that amount to the default account and process the deposit in my application (which tracks the balance).\n\nSo rather than thinking that people are looking for an accounting system, what if we were just wanting to know when a deposit arrived, and when it disappeared again due to a reorg?
