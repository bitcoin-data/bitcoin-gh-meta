If 10.7's C++11 libraries are broken, how can it?\n\nWe ran into something with Armory that sounds similar. IIRC, there was a C++11 call that was present in libc before 2.17 came out, at which point it was moved to librt. If you compiled in Ubuntu 12.04, the call would picked up in libc. (There were other issues, though, that made compilation on 12.04 impossible unless you used clang.) If you compiled it on 12.10 and beyond, the system expected the call to be in librt, which would cause it to fail due to dynamic linking falling apart. Our solution was to force a static link with a special call such that the relevant code would be included in the binary. This way, 12.04 users could run our binaries without issues. A bit ugly but it worked.\n",
