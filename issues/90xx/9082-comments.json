It is not acceptable to have the network topology suddenly change all at once time when segwit activates, due to the risk of creating partitioning (we can't fetch blocks from non-witness peers once segwit is active: so we need to be sure that we're connecting to witness peers before it activates).  The approach used in the codebase was intended to only have nodes behavior change when they are upgraded, so that the change would phase in gradually in the network (and if it caused problems users could revert to escape it).\r\n",

      "body" : "@gmaxwell  Thank you for reviewing this. I'm not sure I understand the partitioning risk you mention. With the currently implementation, I'd already call this partitioned in that 0.13.1 nodes that can make only  outbound connections rarely and only briefly are connecting to non-witness nodes, whereas with this change, only half would be forced to connect to witness nodes, and the other half would connected \"un-forced\" thereby being roughly related to the general distribution of the network (currently about 20% running with node_witness?) thereby for a configuration of 8 outbound connections, it would mean 5 out of those 8 are connected to Witness nodes, compared to 100% of outbound connections without this PR.\n\nThe current code behaves in a way that makes me wonder if it is doing what it was designed to do. It looks like it was designed to do similar to what this PR makes it do - i.e. force half the connections to connect to Witness nodes, and allow the other half to do as they wish, however, because it works by enforcing witness nodes once the connection count reaches half, and the number of nodes connected to, once a node is up and running, is very unlikely to suddenly lose half of its outbound connections, then as outbound connections from time to time are lost, those initial 4 connections which may have connected to non-witness nodes would be replaced by connections which can only connect to Witness nodes, meaning that after a short while 100% of the outbound connections are connected to witness nodes only with no ability (unless internet is lost long enough to disconnect all outbound connections) to connect to non-witness nodes.\n\nIs this current functionality what was intended?\n\nThe only change that happens when SegWit activates, with this PR, is that the minimum of 4 Witness nodes increases to 6 - I can remove this code though so that it stays at 4 - thereby achieving what I suspect the initial design intended to achieve.\n",

It forces a minimum of 4 connections to Witness nodes prior to SegWit activation, and after activation is makes the minimum 6. Therefore, the it is already doing the \"start preferring a while before\" that you mention. The current functionality (partly due to #8949), which I think may have been unintended, is to connect exclusively to witness nodes.\n\nDo you still want me to change it so that it stays at a minimum of 4 connections before and after activation (rather than 4 before and 6 after)? I thought 4 was a little low given the functionality is currently 100% (8 for default MaxOutbound), so I settled on 6 as a middle-road.\n\nI'm also making a fix so that rather than allowing fWitnessActive to be initialised as false, it's initialised in init.cpp to be true or false based on the active tip at initialization.\n",

To correctly write what you're trying to do here, you'd need to make fWitnessActive an `std::atomic<bool>` instead.\n- Having an fWitnessActive in the network code is a huge layer violation. The network code shouldn't need to know about such concepts.\n- As I've explained, we need the connectivity with witness nodes at the time the activation occurs - which means the preferential peering is most important _before_ the actual activation. The easiest way to accomplish that is by doing it always.\n",
