   "body" : "Hopefully this is the right place to post this....if not, simply leave a comment and I will place it somewhere else.\n\n**Why do we need a blockchain or miners?**\n\nWhy dont we simply create 21 million \"Bitcoins\" that cannot be duplicated? Some sort of ridiculously long hash key that a computer generates. Those millions of \"Bitcoins\" are then sold at auction online, immediate cash is generated to further fund the project.\n\nEveryone would agree to this hash, so all the coins could be VERIFIED with a computer code.\nAs long as no one can duplicate the coins, this model works, correct?\n\nInflation would not occur, only 21 million coins were issued. Works just like the Bitcoin model and you don't have to wait till 2032 or whatever!\n\nAlso transactions are now instant! PROBLEM SOLVED\n",
