The above commits were an attempt to push political activism into bitcoin code, and we shall not allow that to happen.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to get back to this issue, but I think it is very important to reaffirm basic bitcoin values and push back on political attacks as serious security issues.\r\n\r\nWe already spent some time around this issue, please allow the community to reevaluate. \r\n\r\nI retry the PR because of a typo in previous one. I won't try this again (sorry about that).\r\n",
