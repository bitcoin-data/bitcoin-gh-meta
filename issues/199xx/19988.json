   "body" : "This replaces the transaction request logic with an encapsulated class that maintains all the state surrounding it. By keeping it stand alone, it can be easily tested (using included unit tests and fuzz tests).\r\n\r\nThe major changes are:\r\n\r\n* Announcements from outbound (and whitelisted) peers are now always preferred over those from inbound peers. This used to be the case for the first request (by delaying the first request from inbound peers), and a bias afters. The 2s delay for requests from inbound peers still exists, but after that, if viable outbound peers remain for any given transaction, they will always be tried first.\r\n* No more hard cap of 100 in flight transactions per peer, as there is less need for it (memory usage is linear in the number of announcements, but independent from the number in flight, and CPU usage isn't affected by it). Furthermore, if only one peer announces a transaction, and it has over 100 in flight already, we still want to request it from them. The cap is replaced with a rule that announcements from such overloaded peers get an additional 2s delay (possibly combined with the existing 2s delays for inbound connections, and for txid peers when wtxid peers are available).\r\n* The limit of 100000 tracked announcements is reduced to 5000; this was excessive. This can be bypassed using the PF_RELAY permission (to accommodate locally dumping a batch of many transactions).\r\n\r\nThis replaces #19184, rebased on #18044 and with many small changes.",
