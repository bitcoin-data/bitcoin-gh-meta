However, this is open source software, and people work on what is important to them. At some point that may mean faster rescanning, but a situation with 151M keys seems so unrealistic that I doubt anyone will specifically target such a use case.\r\n\r\n> But in case Bitcoin Core is still in development,\r\n\r\nThat's not relevant. If you want someone to work on what feels important to you, you'll need convince them somehow, through financial means or otherwise. Starting off by insulting people who write software you're using for free and claiming their software is badly written is unlikely to help you with the latter, though.\r\n\r\n> here is no other way to scan such an amount of keys, because other apps are for private\r\n\r\nThere are tons of other open-source applications that can index the blockchain and query it, some of which are specifically written for that purpose.",
