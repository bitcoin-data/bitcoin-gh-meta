Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI am not sure if there is a RPC method available to directly get the onion address used so I checked it in `localaddresses` returned by `getnetworkinfo` https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/getnetworkinfo.html\r\n\r\nIt was also mentioned in debug.log file:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/92579623-0e367200-f2ab-11ea-9815-f549f3a3756e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI would love to see an onion address and maybe qr code in the wallet if it is listening on Tor similar to [ABCore](https://github.com/greenaddress/abcore/blob/cc629a854f3083cf4bd1a743de80a254c72aa8ea/app/src/main/java/com/greenaddress/abcore/RPCIntentService.java#L134):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/92579987-800ebb80-f2ab-11ea-9d02-fc8744a9c10c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nCheck the onion address in debug.log or `localaddresses` returned for `getnetworkinfo`\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nLinked to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19923 because if we add such option to check the onion address, it will have to be added in the [Tor documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tor.md).\r\n",
