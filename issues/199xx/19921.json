   "body" : "Earlier I was importing several thousands of private keys to Bitcoin Core and it took much time, especially rescan of the blockchain. Few hours, >3 surely.\r\n\r\nBut now, when I am importing 151M private keys (10 GB file with keys) the import process is now taking 2 days and I have 65% for now.\r\n\r\nHow badly Bitcoin Core is written is unbelivable. There is no other way to scan such an amount of keys, because other apps are for private, limited use and do not offer scanning the blockchain with such a large amount of keys.\r\n\r\nWill this be fixed or even rewritten?",
