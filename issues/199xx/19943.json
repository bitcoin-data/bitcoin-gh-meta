   "body" : "I'm trying the following setup with `bitcoind` 0.20.1 (in `regtest` currently, let me know if that behaves differently from `testnet`/`mainnet`):\r\n\r\n```\r\n                    +------------+\r\n         connect    |   Node2    |     addnode\r\nNode1 ------------->| blocksonly |<---------------- Node3\r\n                    | forcerelay |---------------->\r\n                    +------------+     addnode\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Node1 uses `connect` to Node2\r\n* Node2 is a `blocksonly` node, but it whitelists nodes 1 and 3 for `forcerelay` (`whitelist=noban,relay,forcerelay,mempool@<IPs>`)\r\n* Node3 is connected to the public network, and uses `addnode` to Node2\r\n\r\nMy expectation from the test added in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18530 was that when Node3 receives a transaction from the network, it would relay it to Node2, which would in turn relay it to Node1 (thanks to the whitelist). When testing that E2E on `regtest` though it doesn't work: the transaction appears in Node3's mempool, but not in Node1 and Node2's mempools.\r\n\r\n`bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo` on Node3 has `relaytxes: false` for the connections to Node2, which is the likely culprit. The `permissions` field sets `forcerelay` and `relay`, but I'm likely missing a different configuration to force tx-relay. Can someone please point me in the right direction? @MarcoFalke ",
