Please describe.**\r\nAs we all know the more TXes in a Bitcoin wallet the slower and slower it runs.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI had an idea (would be default off of course) where you could set like walletprune=X to whatever number you want and any spent entries in the wallet would be deleted after getting that many confirms. In theory this should greatly speed up wallet activity. This would be completely separate from blockchain pruning which could be on or off.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe main alternative here is rolling your own wallet system or using a service like BitGo for anything more than small projects.\r\n",
