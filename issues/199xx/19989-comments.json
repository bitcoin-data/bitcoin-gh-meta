But after a crash the node says it doesn't have that block. I then send a getblockchaininfo to the node and realize that it has fewers blocks than my database (2 blocks the time I did it but sometimes more blocks).\r\n\r\nAs my node is regtest, no other node sends the missing blocks so I am forced to delete the last blocks from my database (which is left in an inconsistent state with invalid transactions).\r\n\r\nWhere could I find node logs?\r\n\r\nThanks.",
