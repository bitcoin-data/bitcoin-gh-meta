      "body" : "Here is what I've been able to figure out with this issue so far.\r\n\r\n1. I don't think there's a travis caching problem. Travis passing on master but failing in the 726983595 build is just a result of travis job 726983595 above executing `mpgen` in the bitcoin build and current master not doing that. Any changes to `funcs.mk` changes are also reflected in build ids so if build ids are used correctly, there probably shouldn't be a caching issue.\r\n\r\n2. Confirmed setting LDFLAGS variable is the thing that causes RUNPATH not to be set. LDFLAGS environment value gets copied into CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS cached global value, which otherwise would be empty. So prior to #19685, LDFLAGS/CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS value was empty. After #19685 it is \"-L/home/russ/src/bitcoin/depends/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/native/lib\"\r\n\r\n3. So far I don't see a clean fix for this. Partially reverting #19685 and not passing LDFLAGS for native packages is probably not ideal. Overriding LDFLAGS for native_libmultiprocess in particular is hacky. I haven't figured out exactly how setting LDFLAGS does prevent mpgen RUNPATH from being set. MPGEN target has [`INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH`](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/4c599773923afe6829139ce682d723d769e335dc/CMakeLists.txt#L82) set to true. If LDFLAGS is empty or set to harmless value like `-lm` with no `-L` link path, RUNPATH is set. But as soon as `-L` is added, RUNPATH disappears. I think this might have to do with logic https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/blob/11425041f04fd0945480b8f9e9933d1549b93981/Source/cmComputeLinkInformation.cxx#L1720, but so far I don't understand it. I might experiment with LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, but even if this works it would need to be set for the native packages, unset for native packages, so would add unappealing complication. \r\n\r\n4. Fastest way to test this is to hardcode capnp package build id so it doesn't get rebuilt with every change to `funcs.mk`\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/depends/funcs.mk\r\n+++ b/depends/funcs.mk\r\n@@ -45,6 +45,7 @@ $(eval $(1)_all_dependencies:=$(call int_get_all_dependencies,$(1),$($($(1)_type\r\n $(foreach dep,$($(1)_all_dependencies),$(eval $(1)_build_id_deps+=$(dep)-$($(dep)_version)-$($(dep)_recipe_hash)))\r\n $(eval $(1)_build_id_long:=$(1)-$($(1)_version)-$($(1)_recipe_hash)-$(release_type) $($(1)_build_id_deps) $($($(1)_type)_id_string))\r\n $(eval $(1)_build_id:=$(shell echo -n \"$($(1)_build_id_long)\" | $(build_SHA256SUM) | cut -c-$(HASH_LENGTH)))\r\n+$(eval native_capnp_build_id:=f5a3acc1fc3)\r\n final_build_id_long+=$($(package)_build_id_long)\r\n \r\n #compute package-specific paths\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that resulting RUNPATH can be checked with:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nrm -rvf depends/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/native depends/work/staging depends/work/build\r\nmake -C depends MULTIPROCESS=1 native_libmultiprocess_staged\r\nfor f in `find -name mpgen`; do echo == $f ==; readelf -d $f | grep -i path; done\r\n```\r\n\r\nCMakeCache can be examined with:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nmake -C depends MULTIPROCESS=1 native_libmultiprocess_built\r\nfind -name CMakeCache.txt\r\n```",
