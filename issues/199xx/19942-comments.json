It's basically what I mentioned in my first post and except as an RPC call versus an automatic process. Erasing any TXes from the wallet where all the outputs to us are spent and confirmed at least X times.\r\n\r\nIt does seem to work in my testing but it does take multiple passes so I'm not sure if the IsMine() check is correct or something like that. The only issue I haven't figured out is while it seems to work fine while it's running when I shut down bitcoind and restart it comes back showing the wrong balance. I don't know if there are any other unforeseen issues I'm missing?",
