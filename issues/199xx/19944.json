   "body" : "This updates our src/secp256k1 subtree to the latest libsecp256k1 upstream version.\r\n\r\nAs it adds BIP340 support (see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/558), this is a prerequisite for #17977. In particular, it contains:\r\n* A few generic library improvements\r\n* Support for x-only public keys as used by BIP340.\r\n* Support for \"key pair\" objects, making signing more efficient by using a precomputed public key.\r\n* Signing support for BIP340 Schnorr (single-party) signatures.\r\n* Verification support for BIP340 Schnorr signatures.\r\n* Support for verifying tweaked x-only keys, as used by BIP341's Taproot construction.\r\n\r\nThings that are not included:\r\n* MuSig, nor any kind of multisignatures, threshold signatures, ... on top.\r\n* Batch verification.\r\n* Support for variable-length messages in BIP340 (which are still being discussed, but won't affect BIP341, or Bitcoin Core).\r\n* A few more generic improvements that are still in the pipeline, including faster modular inversions.",
