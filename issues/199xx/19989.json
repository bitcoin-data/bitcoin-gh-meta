   "body" : "Hi.\r\n\r\nEverything is working ok, bitcoin node records and notifies new txs and new blocks which I record in a database. But when I restart my laptop after a crash, my database has more blocks than the blockchain.This time a couple of extra blocks.\r\nIt happens almost everytime my computer crashes. \r\n\r\nWhat could be causing this? Maybe the latest blocks are not written to disk (kept in cache)?\r\nIf this happens with testnet and mainnet is not a problemn for my app cause any missing blocks on the node would be retrived from  the blockchain which is not the case in my solitary regtest. \r\n\r\nThanks.",
