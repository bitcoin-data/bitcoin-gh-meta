      "body" : "Thanks for the clear bug report! Agree this behavior is not good. I tend to think a simpler fix would be to just disallow relative -conf paths entirely, making specifying any relative -conf path an error, instead of interpreting relative -conf paths differently depending on the source of the -conf value (command line vs config file vs settings.json).\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of making specifying a relative -conf paths an error instead of changing the interpretation would be that that if someone is relying on current behavior and upgrades they can encounter an explicit error instead of a subtly broken configuration.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is too extreme though? @brianddk maybe you had a use-case for specifying a relative path instead of an absolute path?\r\n\r\nA compromise option instead of forbidding relative -conf paths outright, or interpretting relative -conf paths differently depending on where they are specified might be to only forbid relative -conf paths when a -datadir value is specified.",

I would think the more common answer is that relative paths in command-line parameters would be assumed relative to `$PWD`, which seems to be what most of the unix tool do.  This would be a move more to \"convention\" as opposed to fixing some weird use case.\r\n\r\nRelative paths within a config file have no real \"convention\" to hold to, so I see no need to change that behavior, assuming the two behaviors can be divorced from each other.",

But arguably there are uses cases for this behavior (like putting multiple `1.conf`, `2.conf` files in the default datadir location, and having them specify different options and different final datadir= paths internally, and so you can conveniently pass `-conf=1.conf` or `-conf=2.conf` options on the command line that will work regardless of the current working directory).",
