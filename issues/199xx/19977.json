   "body" : "I'm making a long article about the cryptocurrency forking, and currently, I have I problem:\r\n\r\nWherever I read, every time I find undefined assumptions about when exactly a blockchain diverges in two groups.\r\n\r\nSo, in this call to developers for strongly argumentative answers, I need to know these two basic questions:\r\n\r\n1. When exactly occurs a fork in the Bitcoin blockchain?\r\n2. When exactly does NOT occur a fork in the Bitcoin blockchain?\r\n\r\nSome information that the answer should have is:\r\n\r\nMajor articles mention that in the case _\"when half of the network says the block is OK and the other half says it is WRONG for a period of time, there could occur a fork\"\r\n- What \"period of time\" is it? Does it exist?\r\n- What is the exact percentage of disparity that can produce a fork?\r\n- Is that specified in the protocol or is something like _\"the block verification was sent to all my compatible pairs so a new blockchain was written \"_... And the same with the other side?\r\n\r\nIn a 2013 article from _arsTechnica.com_, [Major glitch in Bitcoin network sparks sell-off; price temporarily falls 23%](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/major-glitch-in-bitcoin-network-sparks-sell-off-price-temporarily-falls-23/), there was an affirmation:\r\n\r\n> It's essential for all miners to enforce exactly the same rules about what counts as a valid block. If a client announces a block that half the network accepts and the other half rejects, the result could be a fork in the network. Different nodes could disagree about which transactions have occurred, potentially producing chaos.\r\n\r\nAt the point where it says _\"`a fork in the network`\"_, it doesn't appear to be speaking about blockchain (the whole history of transactions), what makes me think: What kind of fork? Is this true? What kind of chaos?  \r\nThat's because, until I know, the Bitcoin protocol was designed to disconnect non-compatible nodes.\r\n\r\nI think this \"time\", \"disparity\" or other things are strongly related to the ~10 min rule and the moment in which the first block during-disparity should be written.  \r\nPlease, developers, gift me clarity on this topic to share real information. I will share with you my article when I finished this specific point on it. â I have read around 50 different articles with additional video consumption and there is no way. Just Bitcoins' developers can answer this.",
