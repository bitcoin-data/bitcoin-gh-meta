Issue applies to both 0.3.21 and 0.3.22-rc2. I can take screenshots if needed.\n\n_Examples_\n- In the 'Options' dialog, Nothing below the explanation of transaction fees can be seen, except for OK/Cancel/Apply. The transaction fee option itself, and any options below it, can not be seen. Window can not be resized.\n- In the \"Send Coins\" dialog, the 'Send' and 'Cancel' buttons are not initially visible. However, the window can be resized so that they can be seen.\n- In the 'About' dialog, the license declaration is mangled and cut off. It appears as follows:\n\n<pre>\nDistributed under the MIT/X11 software license, see the\naccompanying file\nlicense.txt or\n</pre>\n",
