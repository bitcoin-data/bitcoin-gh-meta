Otherwise, you wind up with a lot of code that doesn't do anything and may obscure what's _really_ going on. \n\nre: calls to SetKey mlocking -- if that's the case, then you _really_ don't need to copy it to vchKey. All that serves to do is increase the number of copies of keys you have in memory and increases your attack surface.\n\nSecurity-wise: careful, minimal code > paranoid code.

So it's much harder to parallelize an attack with, e.g., an ASIC, as you would need lots of RAM to do so.\n\nBut I agree with you: There have been much more reviews of the SSL code base, and so the chance of critical errors in OpenSSL is much lower compared to scrypt.\n",

This patch already uses the public key as the IV for the encryption of each private key so any kind of brute force/dictionary attack is already ridiculously difficult, I dont see a major advantage to adding a random salt to be used for a given wallet (and then stored in the wallet) as to brute force a wallet, you already need to know some of the information in the wallet (namely the public keys).  But maybe others disagree?\n\n@sysfrog OK, so its agreed then that OpenSSL key derivation is probably the best way to go?\n\n@dizzyd Still planning on updating with some of your original recommendations, but I'm on vacation atm and dont feel like doing much coding.\n",
