More importantly your airgapped wallet might be a dumb smart card.\r\n\r\nInstead the normal client should maintain your balances, create the transaction... but when it goes to sign it it will find out it doesn't have the private key.   So it creates a signing request, which you shuttle over to the secure wallet (somehow). The secure wallet asks you to approve the transactionsÃ¢ÂÂ showing you the outputs and values (perhaps supporting batches), then signs them all, and you shuttle them back over to the main client for injection into the network.\r\n\r\nAlsoÃ¢ÂÂ I described how to solve the running out of addresses problem here: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=19137.0  (the type-2 proposal)\r\n",

User dutifully carries data back to the computer where the trojan then runs off with the keys.\r\n\r\nFar out? A bitÃ¢ÂÂ but it's reduced to nothing not giving the airgap computer more non-trivial data than is required, which is just sound practice.  The block chain is a complicated data-structure which has has triggered vulnerabilities before.  I think of it this way: If someone did pull off this attack, would many people say (in retrospect) that it was obvious and your fault for not avoiding it?  I think so. :)\r\n\r\nAlso, lfm pointed out to me that you need to know the input transactions tooÃ¢ÂÂ otherwise you might be sending lots of money away in fees if your system was compromised.
