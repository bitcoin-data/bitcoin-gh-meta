Or, would we have a non-committed transaction that I could still query by txn ID?\n\nAlternatively, we could keep the estimate call, then include a \"max tx fee\" parameter on the send payment RPC, so it fails if the tx fee ends up over the given amount.  From my perspective, I'm always making these calls from inside a transaction, so I don't mind a later call failing, since it's easy for me to re-run the whole transaction.\n\nFinally, I'm new to git, how do I rebase?  Just create a new branch and make all the changes in one push?\n",
