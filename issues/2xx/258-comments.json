It causes the HD to click noisily all day (with brief pauses) and degrades performance of other applications - web browsing etc.  I keep Bitcoin terminated during the day when working and just run it at night.\n\nHow large is the address DB typically and is it expected to grow with network size? (mine is ~15MB).  If it remains of that order, perhaps an option to keep it in memory would be appropriate?\n\nI'm assuming the 'fsync' suggestion above involves modification of the code, but if there is any 'quick fix' available, that would be a useful temporary workaround for Mac users.  \n\nCheers (- everyones work is appreciated).\n",
