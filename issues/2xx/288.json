All wallet-related globals are turned into fields of CWallet, and one single global, pwalletMain, is added instead.\n\nIt consists of two commits: the first one adds the new source files, and moves as much there as possible without actually changing any code. The second commit adds the class definitions, and all other changes.\n\nForum thread is here: http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=9492.0\n",
