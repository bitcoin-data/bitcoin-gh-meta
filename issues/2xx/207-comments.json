The messages\ncan be suppressed by unchecking a box on the error message dialog and\nthen hitting the continue button.  The client then runs without a\nproblem.  I did install the wxwidgets from their site, but it didn't\nseem to include any extra fonts.  I gave up on the problem since the\nclient works fine and I can see all the text with no issues.  I would\nclassify it as a bug, but not a show stopper.  Will you enter it into\nthe bug tracking system?
