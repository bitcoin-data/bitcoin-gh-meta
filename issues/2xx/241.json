   "body" : "When i try to run bitcoin with -testnet and -datadir=someotherdir\nthings get stored as expected, in someotherdir/testnet\nbut if i try to run it with -server (or run bitcoind), it complains that it can't find rpcpassword, even though it is present in someotherdir/testnet. \n\nWarning: To use the \"-server\" option, you must set rpcpassword=<password>\nin the configuration file: someotherdir/testnet/bitcoin.conf\nIf the file does not exist, create it with owner-readable-only file permissions.\n\nthe file is of course quite present, and has correct permissions.\n\ni have tried copying the .conf file into stock ~/.bitcoin/testnet location, i have tried making a symlink from there to the whole dir - nothing helps. the only way to make it stop complaining is to stop using the -datadir argument, and let it store things in the default location.\n\nThis is a bug, and should be fixed. :)\n\nNote, I have thus far only tried it with -testnet, I do not know if this behavior is only present when using -testnet or not. This needs testing.\n",
