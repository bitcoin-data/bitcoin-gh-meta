   "body" : "Make feebumper methods static and remove stored state in the class.\r\n\r\nHaving the results of feebumper calls persist in an object makes process\r\nseparation between Qt and wallet awkward, because it means the feebumper object\r\neither has to be serialized back and forth between Qt and wallet processes\r\nbetween fee bump calls, or that the feebumper object needs to stay alive in the\r\nwallet process with an object reference passed back to Qt. It's simpler just to\r\nhave fee bumper calls return their results immediately instead of storing them\r\nin an object with an extended lifetime.\r\n\r\nIn addition to making feebumper methods static, also:\r\n\r\n- Move LOCK calls from Qt code to feebumper\r\n- Move TransactionCanBeBumped implementation from Qt code to feebumper\r\n- Rename CFeeBumper class to FeeBumper (every CFeeBumper reference had to be\r\n  updated in this PR anyway so this doesn't increase the size of the diff)\r\n\r\nThis change was originally part of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244",
