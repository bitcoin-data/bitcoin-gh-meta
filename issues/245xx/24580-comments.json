      "body" : "I was just looking into this user asking about a [transaction with 856 inputs](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/q/100437/5406) a few days ago. I'd be curious to see if we could still reproduce behavior like that on a wallet with a UTXO pool of only about 1,000. I think SRD would hopefully make that better, but I would say we could even go higher than 100 here. :)",

      "body" : "Actually I was trying to keep the number of small coins as a low as possible while still demonstrating some inefficiencies of coin selection.\r\n1) The more coins we have -> the more time the test takes.\r\n2) The more coins we have -> the harder it's to debug and to reason about.\r\n\r\nWhat is the test scenario that would be possible with 1000 coins, but not possible with 100 coins?\r\n\r\nP.S. I think we can definitely reproduce this scenario, I see no reasons why not? If utxo pool is equivalent to this test cases then even with SRD it will find better solution in ~856/1000 = 85%, which leaves 15% to a really bad knapsack alternative.",
