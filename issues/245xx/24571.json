   "body" : "The block index might contain stale blocks that are not part of the main chain. If a malicious peer is able to probe a node's block index for certain stale blocks then it can use this information to fingerprint the node.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving headers (either through a `cmpctblock` or `headers` messages)  a node will send `getheaders` if the predecessor of the first header does not exist. This leaks information from the block index if the predecessor of the header is a stale block because no `getheaders` will be sent in that case revealing that the stale block exists in the index.\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents this fingerprinting by sending `getheaders` if the predecessor does not exist or if a block request for the predecessor is not allowed. The logic for not allowing the download of stale blocks has been introduced in previous PRs that also addressed block index fingerprinting (#11113, #5820).\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7b83c7d609ba61c5726650208b53111eb11a4b0e/src/net_processing.cpp#L1454-L1461",
