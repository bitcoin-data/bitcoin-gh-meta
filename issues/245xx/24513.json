We especially hate cosmetic refactors. \r\n\r\nNobody knows better than I that changing broad swaths of code out from under our already-abused collaborators, only to send a cascade of rebase bankruptcies, is annoying at best and sadistic at worst. And for a rename! The indignation!\r\n\r\nBut just for a second, imagine yourself. Programming `bitcoin/bitcoin`, on a sandy beach beneath a lapis lazuli sky. You go to type the name of what is probably the most commonly used data structure in the codebase, and you *only hit shift once*. \r\n\r\nWhat could you do in such a world? You could do anything. [The only limit is yourself.](https://zombo.com/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo maybe you like the idea of this patch but really don't want to deal with rebasing. You're in luck! \r\n\r\nHere're the commands that will bail you out of rebase bankruptcy:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit rebase -i $(git merge-base HEAD master) \\\r\n  -x 'sed -i \"s/CChainState/Chainstate/g\" $(git ls-files | grep -E \".*\\.(py|cpp|h)$\") && git commit --amend --no-edit'\r\n# <commit changed?>\r\ngit add -u && git rebase --continue\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyway I'm not sure how serious I am about this, but I figured it was worth proposing.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can have nice things every once in a while?\r\n",
