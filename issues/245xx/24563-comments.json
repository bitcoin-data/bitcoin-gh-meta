      "body" : "Hmm, the psbt is supposed to \"[contain] the information necessary for a signer to produce signatures for the transaction\"; seems weird that you'd have to specify the sighash type via rpc, and the value in the psbt is only usable for error checking. (And I think the external signer stuff doesn't receive the rpc arg, so can only use the psbt value?) I also think this approach will make it impossible to sign a psbt that specifies an ALL signature on input 1 and a SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY signature on input 2, if the wallet happens to know both keys?\r\n\r\nAnyway, sounds like it's not a no-brainer fix, so will close this and leave to others to worry about.",
