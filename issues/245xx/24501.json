   "body" : "Umbrella issue for 23.0 testing. Please help testing on a wide variety of supported platforms, as well as interaction with different software.\r\n\r\nLet us know which version you tested on which operating system.\r\n\r\nIf you find an issue, please search Github for known issues first and then open a new Github issue. This meta issue should not be used to report bugs, as a single thread makes it impossible to track more than one topic.\r\n\r\n## What to test\r\n\r\nFor an idea what to test, see @stickies-v's [23.0 release candidate testing guide](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/23.0-Release-Candidate-Testing-Guide), or\r\n\r\n- See [Draft Release Notes](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/23.0-Release-Notes-draft) for a list of changes-\r\n- Also see testing reports for earlier releases ([v0.21.0](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20555) [v22.0](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/22634))\r\n\r\n## Known issues (as of rc5)\r\n\r\nOther known issues:\r\n- MacOS: SHA256 acceleration is not enabled on MacOS 11.x due to missing reporting of sysctl `hw.optional.arm.*`. Please upgrade to MacOS 12.x if this is important to you.\r\n\r\n## Known issues fixed (as of rc5)\r\n\r\n- [x] ~~Due to a naming conflict after adding support for the new MacOS architecture, we had to rename the following dmgs manually from `bitcoin-23.0rc2-osx-signed.dmg` during upload:~~\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-23.0rc2-arm64-apple-darwin.dmg\r\nbitcoin-23.0rc2-x86_64-apple-darwin.dmg\r\n```\r\n~~This may cause issues during verification because in the `SHA256SUMS.asc` they still have the old name.~~\r\n- [x] ~~MacOS: please postpone the Monterey 12.3.1 update until 23.0rc4 to test whether #23134 has been really fixed~~ (it's really fixed, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24501#issuecomment-1086857682)\r\n- [x] ~~#24726 bitcoind/-qt may silently fail on Windows when using AVX2 SHA256 implementation~~\r\n- [x] ~bitcoin-core/gui#571~~\r\n- [x] ~~Windows GUI crashes while rendering bandwidth graph: bitcoin-core/gui#582~~",
