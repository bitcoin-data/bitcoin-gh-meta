The reason/question is, are expressions/words like \"chain state\", \"fee rate\", and \"block hash\" each one word or two? For me, and maybe for people not closely familiar since years with Bitcoin development, they are two words--at least originally, which I guess is why there are classes in the codebase like CChainState and CFeeRate. I usually grep case-indifferently anyway, so this wouldn't change anything (if it doesn't break anything). Just one weakly held light opinion.",

I beg: give it a bit of a rest, we have so many other things that are crying for our attention and our resolve. We should try to find some initiatives that we all feel more excited about, success with them would make it easier to work on other things... but right now a big style change is just not a unifying effort.\r\n\r\nI don't have a strong enough opinion to NACK this PR but the above seems to add some historical context behind previous attempts to do renames like this which may be helpful for other reviewers.",

Not saying this PR is the best example, I\nagree that style changes aren't as productive, but trivial refactors and\nimprovements that improve code quality in non-consensus critical code\nshouldn't take years to merge.\n\nI get that we are being conservative, but I think the bigger factor to\nthe brain drain is the fact that people put in effort to do small code\nquality improvements just to wait years to even see it merged.\n\nNow people don't even bother to improve code quality because of this\nweird meme that refactors don't matter, and only new features matter.\nPerhaps I'm off base here since I'm not a fulltime core dev but that's\njust been my perspective watching core dev over the past decade.\n",

When there is a large or otherwise breaking code change, scripted-diff renames can be appended at minimal extra cost. Sometimes they are even the better choice, to create compile failures for silent merge conflicts that may otherwise sneak in unnoticed. They wouldn't increase the number of conflicts (as the code is touched anyway for other reasons) and the review spent on the scripted-diff is negligible compared to the review spent on the other changes.",
