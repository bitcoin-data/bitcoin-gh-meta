   "body" : "Self-compiled BDB was added to this job as opposed to using depends BDB [due to linking issues](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18288#discussion_r433189350), however the compiled BDB is not actually used. Remove it for now, given we don't actually lose any coverage (note that BDB is also not currently used in the naitve MSAN fuzz job or for [OSS Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/bitcoin-core/build.sh#L32) builds).\r\n\r\nIn future, we can use depends BDB, however introducing it now will cause false positives, which can be fixed by upgrading the versions of Clang / LLVM we use, however upgrading to those newer versions causes other issues, which appear in standard library code, and require more involved suppressing, which can be solved in a follow up or another PR i.e #23008.",
