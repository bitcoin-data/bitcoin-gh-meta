Based on review there, we thought it would be an improvement to merge `ScriptPubKeyToUniv` and `ScriptToUniv` into a single function, but this didn't seem to belong in that PR.\r\n\r\nThe only commit in this PR is 2aecd7d, others should be reviewed as part of #22650\r\n\r\ncc @jonatack - you had reviewed this commit before it got split out of the original PR. Although note: @MarcoFalke pointed out a few named arg comments were wrong after these functions were combined (in the previous PR review), so that has been fixed in 2aecd7d",
