These are just two different methods of \"internal\" serialization. I have been trying to get #10102 reviewed for years now, so my preference is to have less code in #10102 not more code.

And in that case, the existing serialization seemed broken so it did seem better remove. The serialization here seems perfectly simple and not broken, so I'm ask whether this serialization would be better not to remove. I am asking what problem removing serialization solves and whether different solution, like marking it internal and deprioritizing fuzzing that would solve the problem.

The issue is how much more custom serialization code has to be added #10102 making it more work to review. If there is one \"remove serialization\" PR. I don't care.

It could be stream serialization, it could be json serialization, it could be field-by-field capnp struct serialization. Using the standard steam serialization is just nice because it's one line of code and works out of the box with no need for any CFeeRate code in src/ipc/capnp.",
