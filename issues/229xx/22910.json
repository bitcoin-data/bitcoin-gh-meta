   "body" : "The asmap data is currently owned by addrman, but is used by both addrman and connman. #22791 made the data const and private (so that it can't be updated by other components), but it is still passed out of addrman as a reference to const, and used by `CNetAddress` to calculate the group and AS of the net address.\r\n\r\nThis RFC PR proposes to move all asmap data and logic into a new `NetGroupManager` component. This is initialized at startup, and the client components addrman and connman simply call `NetGroupManager::GetGroup(const CAddress&)` and `NetGroupManager::GetMappedAS(const CAddress&)` to get the net group and AS of an address.",
