Those are such wildly different scenarios that if we want it, the documentation should clearly explain what it means.

It is at least possible that a reviewer disagrees with the Concept, Approach (e.g. NACKed) but still wants to ensure there aren't bugs in the code and so does a code review.\r\n\r\n> what you could do is just decode that crACK means \"code review ack\", and then highlight that for all these aliases the meaning is rather ambiguous.\r\n\r\nI'd rather people just wrote `ACK BRANCH_COMMIT` with Code Review either before or after it plus optional additional details on exactly what the code review entailed. I don't think the time saved by using the shortened crACK is going to be material in the long run. No one seems to use cACK or aACK to save on typing :)",
