   "body" : "This allows an optional tx_invalid.json parameter at position 3 with the format:\r\n```json\r\n[{\"if_unset\": [\"A\", \"D\"], \"then_unset\": [\"B\", \"C\"]}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring the one-by-one flag mutation (patched in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22948 to be all combinations, hence the support of multiple) which checks that if disable required flags `[\"A\", \"D\"]` are all unset then the flags `[\"B\", \"C\"]` should become unset as well. The unsetting logic loops until the flags are unset (so rules like if_unset A then_unset B and if_unset B then_unset D end up with B and D unset if A is unset and B is set initially).\r\n\r\nThe current use case of this modification is:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[{\"if_unset\": [\"DEFAULT_CHECK_TEMPLATE_VERIFY_HASH\"], \"then_unset\": [\"DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS\"]}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows us to write use cases wherein we expect DEFAULT_CHECK_TEMPLATE_VERIFY_HASH to be enabled for the tx to be invalid, but desire for it to be valid (and not discouraged) when it is off. After activation of such a soft fork, we can remove such a rule.\r\n\r\nWe do not want to do this via a TrimFlags rule as it should not happen across all transactions, only the ones we specify.\r\n\r\nIt would also be possible to have a list of allowed unsettable flags (e.g., just DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS and other standardness rules), but it is not required. While the allowing of multiple rules is perhaps extra, this keeps the format flexible for future needs.",
