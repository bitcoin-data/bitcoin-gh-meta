So I am not sure how useful it would be to add to this repo, as the CI-runs are based on a minimal set of inputs that reach maximal coverage. (It would still be run by google OSS-Fuzz and my fuzzing servers when generating).\r\n\r\nHowever, I am also wondering how often the code would be modified. (The number of bugs found via fuzzing is correlated to the rate of changes made to the code). So maybe just implementing whatever you find easiest somewhere out-of-tree and then running it only once after the code is merged to master should be sufficient?\r\n\r\nOr what about just using the recommended list of unit test vectors (if there is one) which would hopefully already cover all logic paths without the need for any fuzzing?",
