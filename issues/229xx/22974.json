   "body" : "Currently, `CAddrman::Good()` is rather slow because the process of moving an addr from new to tried involves looping over the new tables twice:\r\n1) In `Good_()`, there is a loop searching for a new bucket the addr is currently in, but this information is never used except for aborting if it is not found anywhere (since [this commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/e6b343d880f50d52390c5af8623afa15fcbc65a2#diff-49d1faa58beca1ee1509a247e0331bb91f8604e30a483a7b2dea813e6cea02e2R263) it is no longer passed to `MakeTried`)\r\nThis is unnecessary because in a non-corrupted addrman, an address that is not in New must be either in Tried or not at all in addrman, both cases in which we'd return early in `Good_()` and never get to this point.\r\nI removed this loop (and left a check for `nRefCount` as a belt-and-suspenders check).\r\n\r\n2) In `MakeTried()`, which is called from `Good_()`, another loop removes all instances of this address from new. This can be spedup by stopping the search at  `nRefCount==0`. Further reductions in `nRefCount` would only lead to an assert anyway.\r\nMoreover, the search can be started at the bucket determined by the source of the addr for which `Good` was called, so that if it is present just once in New, no further buckets need to be checked.\r\n\r\nWhile calls to `Good()` are not that frequent normally, the performance gain is clearly seen in the fuzz target `addman_serdeser`, where, because of the slowness in creating a decently filled addrman, a shortcut was created that would directly populate the tried tables by reaching into addrman's internals, bypassing `Good()` (#21129). \r\nI removed this workaround in the second commit: Using `Good()` is still slower by a factor of 2 (down from a factor of ~60 before), but I think that this compensated by the advantages of not having to reach into the internal structures of addrman  (see https://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/pull/18#issuecomment-775218676).\r\n\r\n[Edit]: For benchmark results see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22974#issuecomment-919435266 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22974#issuecomment-920445700 - the benchmark `AddrManGood` shows a significant speedup by a factor >100.
