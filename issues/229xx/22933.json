   "body" : "I noticed that many node operators customize the version strings of their `bitoind`, usually by adding their nicknames after the `CLIENT_VERSION_BUILD`. This typically looks something like `70016/Satoshi:22.99.0(myalias)/` or `70016/Satoshi:22.99.0/myalias/`.\r\n\r\nGiven there are also other ways to personalize a node (e.g., by generating a vanity Tor / I2P address), I'm wondering if changing the version string is safe to do?\r\n\r\n1) Is adding an alias compliant with the specs?\r\n2) Does `bitcoind` check the version strings of its peers to decide whom to communicate with? If yes, which parts specifically are checked?\r\n3) If not, is it safe to remove the version string completely for privacy/security reasons? I see one node that just displays the protocol (`70016`), for example, and another one shows nothing at all.\r\n\r\n_(This is not a feature request, but I didn't know an easier place to find people who know the Bitcoin Core codebase ...)_\r\n",
