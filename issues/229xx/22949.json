   "body" : "When calculating the fee for a feerate, it is possible that the final calculation will have fractional satoshis. Currently those are ignored via truncation which results in the absolute fee being rounded down. Rounding down is problematic because it results in a feerate that is slightly lower than the feerate represented by the `CFeeRate` object. A slightly lower feerate particularly causes issues for coin selection as it can trigger an assertion error. To avoid potentially underpaying the feerate (and the assertion), always round up the calculated fee.\r\n\r\nA test is added for the assertion, along with a comment explaining what happens.\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely that a user can trigger this as it requires a very specific set of rounding errors to occur as well as the transaction not needing any change and being right on the lower bound of the exact match window. However I was able to trigger the assertion while running coin selection simulations, albeit after thousands of transactions and with some weird feerates.",
