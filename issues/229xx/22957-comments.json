      "body" : "I find it confusing actually - esp. as there's no documentation except the test code on what the format of any particular file is - and some files use more than one format!  I'm not saying an official schema is necessary - but a table - in the test source code - would be nice.  \r\n\r\nPlus, and this has bothered me - each test vector has only exactly the data needed for the particular test it is used in at the particular time the test was written _even though when **generating** the test vectors more data was available_.  That additional data could be used, later, to enhance the tests using them or to provide new tests, with additional validation on the _same test vectors_.  Which would be nice.  What I'm suggesting here is that as long as you're going to the trouble to generate useful _correct_ test vectors drop _all_ relevant information into the JSON for that test vector so that subsequent tests - that you haven't envisioned - can be more easily written.  (Oh, and another use for the additional data: developers investigating bitcoin techniques and algorithms (i.e., learning it, getting better understanding, thinking/trying enhancements) will have a useful data set with which to work in ways the test author, who is generating the test vectors, hasn't envisioned for the tests being written.",
