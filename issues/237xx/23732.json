   "body" : "Contributes to #21005.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to remove `gArgs` from database classes (i.e. `bdb.h` and `sqlite.h`) so that they can be tested without relying on `gArgs` in tests.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* My goal is to enable unit-testing without relying on `gArgs` as much as possible. Global variables are hard to reason about which in turn makes it slightly harder to contribute to this codebase. When the compiler does the heavy lifting for us and allows us only to construct an object (or call a method) with valid parameters, we may also save some time in code reviews. The cost for this is passing an argument which is not for free but the cost is very miniscule compared to benefits, I think.\r\n    * GUI code is an exception because it seems fine to have `gArgs` there so I don't plan to make changes in `src/qt` folder, for example.\r\n* My approach to removal of `gArgs` uses is moving from lower levels to upper ones and pass `ArgsManager` as an argument as needed. The approach is very similar to what #20158. ",
