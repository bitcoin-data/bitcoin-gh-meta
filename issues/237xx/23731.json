However, it seems inconsistent to special-case this one for a questionable privacy benefit, given that there are already potential privacy leaks with the other settings. Moreover, any potential privacy leak seems questionable, since `p2sh-witness` will later be revealed to be a wrapped witness spend on-chain. So I think we might as well use native witness to at least save the user some fees.",
