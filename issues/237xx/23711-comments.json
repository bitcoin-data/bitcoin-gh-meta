A transaction may conflict with multiple in-mempool\n+transactions.\n+\n+A transaction (\"replacement transaction\") may replace its directly conflicting\n+transactions and their in-mempool descendants (together, \"original transactions\") if, in addition to\n+passing all other consensus and policy rules, each of the following conditions are met:\n+\n+1. The directly conflicting transactions must all signal replaceability explicitly. A transaction is\n+   signaling replaceability if any of its inputs have an nSequence number less than (0xffffffff - 1).\n+\n+   *Rationale*: See [BIP125\n+   explanation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki#motivation).\n+\n+2. The replacement transaction may only include an unconfirmed input if that input was included in\n+   one of the original transactions. An unconfirmed input spends an output from a\n+   currently-unconfirmed transaction.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: When RBF was originally implemented, the mempool did not keep track of\n+   ancestor scores yet. This rule was suggested as a temporary restriction.\n+\n+3. The replacement transaction must pay an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original\n+   transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Only requiring the replacement transaction to have a higher feerate could allow an\n+   attacker to bypass node minimum relay feerate requirements and cause the network to repeatedly\n+   relay slightly smaller replacement transactions without adding any more fees.\n+\n+4. The additional fees (difference between absolute fee paid by the replacement transaction and the\n+   sum paid by the original transactions) must pay for the replacement transaction's bandwidth at or\n+   above the rate set by the node's incremental relay feerate. For example, if the incremental relay\n+   feerate is 1 satoshi/vB and the replacement transaction is 500 virtual bytes total, then the\n+   replacement must pay a fee at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the original transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Prevent a DoS attack where an attacker causes the network to repeatedly relay\n+   transactions each paying a tiny additional amount in fees, e.g. just 1 satoshi.\n+\n+5. The number of original transactions must not exceed 100. More precisely, the sum of all\n+   directly conflicting transactions' descendant counts (number of transactions inclusive of itself\n+   and its descendants) must not exceed 100.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Prevent a DoS attack where an attacker is able to easily occupy and flush out\n+   significant portions of the node's mempool using replacements.",

A transaction may conflict with multiple in-mempool\n+transactions.\n+\n+A transaction (\"replacement transaction\") may replace its directly conflicting\n+transactions and their in-mempool descendants (together, \"original transactions\") if, in addition to\n+passing all other consensus and policy rules, each of the following conditions are met:\n+\n+1. The directly conflicting transactions must all signal replaceability explicitly. A transaction is\n+   signaling replaceability if any of its inputs have an nSequence number less than (0xffffffff - 1).\n+\n+   *Rationale*: See [BIP125\n+   explanation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki#motivation).\n+\n+2. The replacement transaction may only include an unconfirmed input if that input was included in\n+   one of the original transactions. An unconfirmed input spends an output from a\n+   currently-unconfirmed transaction.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: When RBF was originally implemented, the mempool did not keep track of\n+   ancestor scores yet. This rule was suggested as a temporary restriction.\n+\n+3. The replacement transaction must pay an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original\n+   transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Only requiring the replacement transaction to have a higher feerate could allow an\n+   attacker to bypass node minimum relay feerate requirements and cause the network to repeatedly\n+   relay slightly smaller replacement transactions without adding any more fees.\n+\n+4. The additional fees (difference between absolute fee paid by the replacement transaction and the\n+   sum paid by the original transactions) must pay for the replacement transaction's bandwidth at or\n+   above the rate set by the node's incremental relay feerate. For example, if the incremental relay\n+   feerate is 1 satoshi/vB and the replacement transaction is 500 virtual bytes total, then the\n+   replacement must pay a fee at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the original transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Prevent a DoS attack where an attacker causes the network to repeatedly relay\n+   transactions each paying a tiny additional amount in fees, e.g. just 1 satoshi.\n+\n+5. The number of original transactions must not exceed 100. More precisely, the sum of all\n+   directly conflicting transactions' descendant counts (number of transactions inclusive of itself\n+   and its descendants) must not exceed 100.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Prevent a DoS attack where an attacker is able to easily occupy and flush out\n+   significant portions of the node's mempool using replacements.",

A transaction may conflict with multiple in-mempool\n+transactions.\n+\n+A transaction (\"replacement transaction\") may replace its directly conflicting transactions and\n+their in-mempool descendants (together, \"original transactions\") if, in addition to passing all\n+other consensus and policy rules, each of the following conditions are met:\n+\n+1. The directly conflicting transactions must all signal replaceability explicitly. A transaction is\n+   signaling replaceability if any of its inputs have an nSequence number less than (0xffffffff - 1).\n+\n+   *Rationale*: See [BIP125\n+   explanation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki#motivation).\n+\n+2. The replacement transaction may only include an unconfirmed input if that input was included in\n+   one of the directly conflicting transactions. An unconfirmed input spends an output from a\n+   currently-unconfirmed transaction.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: When RBF was originally implemented, the mempool did not keep track of\n+   ancestor scores yet. This rule was suggested as a temporary restriction.\n+\n+3. The replacement transaction must pay an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original\n+   transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Only requiring the replacement transaction to have a higher feerate could allow an\n+   attacker to bypass node minimum relay feerate requirements and cause the network to repeatedly\n+   relay slightly smaller replacement transactions without adding any more fees.\n+\n+4. The additional fees (difference between absolute fee paid by the replacement transaction and the\n+   sum paid by the original transactions) must pay for the replacement transaction's bandwidth at or\n+   above the rate set by the node's incremental relay feerate. For example, if the incremental relay\n+   feerate is 1 satoshi/vB and the replacement transaction is 500 virtual bytes total, then the\n+   replacement must pay a fee at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the original transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Try to attempt DoS attacks where an attacker causes the network to repeatedly relay\n+   transactions each paying a tiny additional amount in fees, e.g. just 1 satoshi.\n+\n+5. The number of original transactions must not exceed 100. More precisely, the sum of all\n+   directly conflicting transactions' descendant counts (number of transactions inclusive of itself\n+   and its descendants) must not exceed 100.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Try to prevent DoS attacks where an attacker is able to easily occupy and flush out\n+   significant portions of the node's mempool using replacements with multiple directly conflicting\n+   transactions, each with large descendant sets.\n+\n+This set of rules is similar but distinct from BIP125.",

The higher level might be nice as to describing what we want the policy to accomplish and then the concrete policy can be described separately.\r\n\r\nI like this framing: that we should (1) communicate our overall design philosophy in a resource for developers and (2) provide concrete/precise documentation of the code we're releasing to other devs/users.\r\n\r\n> Given mempool policy is directly consumed by downstream projects for a number of safety-critical operations, I believe its documentation correctness matters. I don't think we have, at least not yet (?), a consistent review process for the wiki.\r\n\r\nI agree with this. The high-level ideas fit well in the dev wiki (which we can all collaborate freely on) and the concrete documentation of our policy interface should be reviewed + packaged with the code.",

A transaction may conflict with multiple in-mempool\n+transactions.\n+\n+A transaction (\"replacement transaction\") may replace its directly conflicting transactions and\n+their in-mempool descendants (together, \"original transactions\") if, in addition to passing all\n+other consensus and policy rules, each of the following conditions are met:\n+\n+1. The directly conflicting transactions must all signal replaceability explicitly. A transaction is\n+   signaling replaceability if any of its inputs have an nSequence number less than (0xffffffff - 1).\n+\n+   *Rationale*: See [BIP125\n+   explanation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki#motivation).\n+\n+2. The replacement transaction may only include an unconfirmed input if that input was included in\n+   one of the directly conflicting transactions. An unconfirmed input spends an output from a\n+   currently-unconfirmed transaction.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: When RBF was originally implemented, the mempool did not keep track of\n+   ancestor scores yet. This rule was suggested as a temporary restriction.\n+\n+3. The replacement transaction must pay an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original\n+   transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Only requiring the replacement transaction to have a higher feerate could allow an\n+   attacker to bypass node minimum relay feerate requirements and cause the network to repeatedly\n+   relay slightly smaller replacement transactions without adding any more fees.\n+\n+4. The additional fees (difference between absolute fee paid by the replacement transaction and the\n+   sum paid by the original transactions) must pay for the replacement transaction's bandwidth at or\n+   above the rate set by the node's incremental relay feerate. For example, if the incremental relay\n+   feerate is 1 satoshi/vB and the replacement transaction is 500 virtual bytes total, then the\n+   replacement must pay a fee at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the original transactions.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Try to attempt DoS attacks where an attacker causes the network to repeatedly relay\n+   transactions each paying a tiny additional amount in fees, e.g. just 1 satoshi.\n+\n+5. The number of original transactions must not exceed 100. More precisely, the sum of all\n+   directly conflicting transactions' descendant counts (number of transactions inclusive of itself\n+   and its descendants) must not exceed 100.\n+\n+   *Rationale*: Try to prevent DoS attacks where an attacker is able to easily occupy and flush out\n+   significant portions of the node's mempool using replacements with multiple directly conflicting\n+   transactions, each with large descendant sets.\n+\n+This set of rules is similar but distinct from BIP125.",
