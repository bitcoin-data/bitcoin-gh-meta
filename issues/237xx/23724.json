   "body" : "There has been light conceptual agreement on including the Userspace, Statically Defined Tracing tracepoints in Bitcoin Core release builds. This, for example, enables user to hook into production deployments, if they need to. Binaries don't have to be switched out. This is possible because we don't do [expensive computations](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tracing.md#no-expensive-computations-for-tracepoints) only needed for the tracepoints. The tracepoints are NOPs when not used.\r\n\r\nSystemtap's `sys/sdt.h` header is required to build Bitcoin Core with USDT support. The header file defines the `DTRACE_PROBE` macros used in [`src/util/trace.h`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/util/trace.h). This PR adds Systemtap 4.5 (May 2021) as dependency. GUIX builds for Linux hosts now include the tracepoints.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23297.",
