Many people seem to support the idea of documenting our _current_ RBF policy as it stands today.\r\n\r\nAs the ancestor/descendant limit carve-out exemptions are very related to RBF, it seemed appropriate to group them with this PR.\r\n\r\nRelated to #22806 - it seems that these policies are the most confusing for people, or at least the most documentation-requested.",
