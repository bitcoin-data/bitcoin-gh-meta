   "body" : "In the current way in which GetScriptPubKeyMan is used, there are multiple places where it is expected to fail and return empty. When this happens, the function writes to the logs that the searched output type doesn't exist. Since this function is called in multiple places as part of a loop to search the output types which do exist, this logs gets outputted a lot, while it's really quite irrelevant and expected. In the current situation, it can sometimes practically spam the logs with this quite unclear and worrying message, while in fact it is completely expected and (at least mostly) irrelevant...\r\n\r\nI would suggest to either remove it or suppress it where it is used in a loop to search for the existing type.\r\nIf this makes sense I'd be happy to submit a PR for this.",
