   "body" : "# Motivation\r\nThe main motivation of this change and only behavior change noticeable by user is to allow running `coinstatsindex` on pruned nodes as has been requested [here for example](https://twitter.com/benthecarman/status/1388170854140452870?s=20).\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n`coinstatsindex` on pruned nodes can be enabled in a much simpler than it is done here but it comes with downside. The ability to run `blockfilterindex`on pruned nodes was added in #15946 but it also added the `blockfilterindex` as a dependency to `validation` and it introduced two new circular dependencies. Enabling `coinstatsindex` on pruned nodes in a similar way would add it as a dependency as well and introduce another circular dependency. \r\n\r\nInstead, this PR introduces a `m_prune_blockers` map to `BlockManager` as a flexible approach to block pruning. Entities like `blockfilterindex`, for example, can add a key and a height to block pruning over that height. These entities need to update that value to allow more pruning when they are ready.\r\n\r\n# Alternative approach\r\nUpon completing the first draft of this PR I found #19463 as an alternative that follows the same but follows a very different approach. I am listing the main differences here as I see them:\r\n- Usage of globals\r\n- Blocks pruning with a start and a stop height\r\n- Can persist blockers across restarts\r\n- Blockers can be set/unset via RPCs\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't think any of these are necessary to be added here but if the general approach or specific features are more appealing to reviewers I am happy to change to a solution based on that PR or port over specific parts of it here.",
