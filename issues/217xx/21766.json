Let's discuss and collate them here so that we don't lose track of them!\r\n\r\n1. `m_chain` methods should perhaps require holding `cs_main`\r\n    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21391#discussion_r613951719\r\n2. `Ensure*()` in src/rpc should be called at the top of functions to fail as early as possible\r\n    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21391#discussion_r613992845\r\n    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21391#discussion_r613942578\r\n    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21391#discussion_r613944794\r\n3. IncrementExtraNonce does not need `cs_main`, and the locking scope can be limited\r\n    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21391#discussion_r613967463\r\n4. `CoinsDB.Cursor()` passes ownership to caller and should return a `std::unique_ptr`\r\n    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21391#discussion_r614696860\r\n5. Call to `GetNetworkHashPS` in `getnetworkhashps` contains many operators, which may increase risk of precedence bugs\r\n    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21391#discussion_r613953875\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to comment here for extra ones I've missed!",
