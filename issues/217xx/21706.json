   "body" : "This is an alternative to #21603 in an attempt to solve #21559.\r\n\r\nExample for the approach in this PR: Location A logs excessively and logging gets suppressed for up to one hour. All logs from any other location will also be dropped during the suppression period. After ~one hour logging restarts and a message with a report on which locations have been suppressed is printed to the log.\r\n\r\nThe key difference to #21603 is that logging is suppressed globally instead of \"per source location\" when at least one source location is logging excessively. \r\n\r\nApproach review is probably the best next step to determine which of the two PRs to move forward with.",
