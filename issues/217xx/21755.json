Regtest and Signet can be ignored because the error message will become too long and both networks are mostly used by devs who are either aware of prefixes or understand errors or know the right place to ask questions if any doubt.\r\n\r\nWe have so many prefixes and networks that ideally such error should just have one link which user can open and check all the information about correct prefixes. Although this can also work for time being.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21741",
