I've only seen it happen like 2-3x before but since the blockchain backed up last Friday it's been worse and worse. We do have a fair amount of unconfirmed consolidation TXes from before the blockchain backed up with low fees set so I had kind of thought maybe it's ignoring TXes with too low of a fee rate or something like that?\r\n\r\nI did find this report and maybe it is the same or related? https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20943\r\n",
