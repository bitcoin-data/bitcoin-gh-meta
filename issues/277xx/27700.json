   "body" : "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nI'm testing v25.0rc2. Occasionally it becomes unresponsive. Simple requests like 'getblockcount' time out.\r\n\r\nI tried running in gdb to see where the code was getting hung up. It was loading the mempool.dat file, spending lots of time in `CTxMemPool::addUnchecked()`, running this line:\r\n\r\n```vTxHashes.emplace_back(tx.GetWitnessHash(), newit);```\r\n\r\nand also in `CTxMemPool::TrimToSize()`.\r\n\r\nI added some LogPrintf() calls. It took 2380 seconds to load just 26 tx from the mempool.dat. That's 91 seconds per tx. Here's the relevant section of the [debug.log](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/11510059/debug.log).\r\n\r\nThe issue only happens when the `maxmempool` value is reached, but that's not enough to trigger it. The only time I've seen the issue happen is with the default 300 MB mempool limit. I tried using a 200 MB limit, but this issue didn't happen. Then I set it back to the default 300 and now I can't reproduce the issue.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nI expect 'getblockcount' to be quick.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI'm not able to reproduce.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv25.0rc2\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nDebian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)\n\n### Machine specifications\n\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz\r\nSSL disk\r\nCable internet",
