   "body" : "The current procedure for building the block filter index involves processing filters one at a time;\r\nReading blocks, undo data, and previous headers from disk sequentially.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new mechanism that employs concurrent processing. Dividing the\r\nfilters generation workload among a pool of workers that can be configured by the user,\r\nsignificantly increasing the speed of the index construction process.\r\n\r\nThe new init flag that enables the parallelized sync behavior is `-blockfilterindexworkers=<n>`.\r\nWhere \"n\" is the number of worker threads that will be spawned to create ranges of\r\nblock filters during the initial sync process. Destroying the workers pool once the\r\ninitial sync completes.\r\nNote: by default, the parallelized sync process is not enabled.\r\n\r\nNow the juicy part:\r\nIn my computer, only with `-blockfilterindexworkers=4`, the block filter index generation\r\ntook less than an hour. While, in master, the sync took more than 7 hours.\r\n\r\nTO DO:\r\n* [Â ] Start up the node with a different chain is not supported yet, need to add a `Rewind` call.\r\n\r\nFootnote:\r\nThis is part of a larger project :).",
