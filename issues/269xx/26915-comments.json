These are the only ones potentially susceptible to this specific error, though it's unlikely to happen in normal use because they don't download the old releases by default (ie - `DOWNLOAD_PREVIOUS_RELEASES` isn't set). And it looks like `tidy` doesn't even run any tests.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if they use `--with-incompatible-bdb` just for convenience or whether there's another reason. If the former, then I guess this PR should be fully dropped and (optionally) a new one opened to just make those two use the canonical BDB. Otherwise, I think this PR ought to be reopened, as it could be valuable for those wishing to build Bitcoin with a semi-compatible BDB.",

I think the reason I am running into this more often locally is that the download folder is preserved between CI tasks and that the presence of the folder is enough to trigger the tests. (`git grep PREVIOUS_RELEASES_DIR`)\r\n\r\nSo I have several thoughts:\r\n\r\n1) The releases dir could be a volume, similar to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27033\r\n1) The releases dir could remain unset for the other tasks?\r\n1) `--with-incompatible-bdb` could be removed?\r\n\r\nCurrently I lean toward (1)",
