   "body" : "Adds a Dockerfile configuration ~~(originally written mostly by fanquake)~~ that allows straightforward running of linters with compatible versions locally. This removes a ton of annoyance when trying to appease CI, because many of the linter versions are quite old and difficult to maintain locally.\r\n\r\nI realize that people may not be thrilled to add more ancillary tooling to the repo, but I think this makes a lot of sense given the linter versions listed in this container configuration are dictated by this repo (within the CI configuration), so having these things live in two separate places is a recipe for version mismatches.\r\n\r\nEventually we can likely just use this container on CI directly to avoid any chance of inconsistencies between local dev experience and CI.\r\n\r\n",
