   "body" : "This PR adds a validation for the arguments `bitcoin-cli` and provides more information when during the execution of the [command described here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/692#issuecomment-1367470026), `bitcoin-cli `first tries to obtain a default wallet in order to execute different commands (including -generate) and that's the error we see and it's a bit confusing since the user specified `-rpcwallet.`\r\n\r\nReviewing [gui PR 692](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/692) stumpled upon with @RandyMcMilllan's [screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/152159/209985593-0fe468fc-038b-44d2-90fc-303ecc3944d4.png) and I've investigated also how ArgsManager handles and parses the command line arguments, it seems that it's implicit that arguments starting with \"-\" are ignored if they are after a non-optional argument (non-GNU option parsing, as we can see [in its code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/114c5eca77fc3d4b4af812358ed471e7e5166e9d/src/util/system.cpp#L316) and [in the tests](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/547a96362888d2fa02d496c192dcdb7ea7d72813/src/test/argsman_tests.cpp#L226-L228) covering it.\r\n\r\nSo, a user running `-generate -rpcwallet=XXX` would expect also to the command `-generate -3 -rpcwallet=XX` to work but `-rpcwallet` in the last command is ignored and the failure indicates that there's no wallet loaded in the node or there are more than 1, that's why I'm adding also the suggestion to use the command `bitcoin-cli listwallets` to verify that that's the case.\r\n\r\nIn order to reproduce the issue please follow the steps:\r\n\r\n1.- start a bitcoin node (easier to use regtest network): \r\n`$ bitcoind -regtest `\r\n\r\n2.- if you don't have any wallet created, create one, this will also load it into the node: \r\n```\r\n$ bitcoin-cli -regtest createwallet testWallet1\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"testWallet1\",\r\n  \"warning\": \"\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.- otherwise just load the wallet you already have:\r\n`$ bitcoin-cli -regtest loadwallet \"yourWalletName\"`\r\n\r\n4.- repeat steps 2 or 3 depending on your setup but make sure you have 2 or more wallets loaded into the node, verify that with the `listwallets` command:\r\n```\r\n$ bitcoin-cli -regtest listwallets\r\n[\r\n  \"testWallet2\",\r\n  \"testWallet1\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n5.- run the -generate command specifying the `-rpcwallet` you wish to generate:\r\n```\r\n$ bitcoin-cli -regtest -generate -rpcwallet=testWallet2\r\n{\r\n  \"address\": \"bcrt1qmdsy3xnuhcyf766avnjhvdg5ftx2whm7fwlgcu\",\r\n  \"blocks\": [\r\n    \"242a2d9072bdaf4c334989291bf7925d42b02b5b4ad14ec4b19b3738579538ef\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could also get a block generated if you run:\r\n`$ bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=testWallet2 -generate`\r\nor\r\n`$ bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=testWallet2 -generate 1`\r\n\r\nBut you will get an error if you run:\r\n```\r\n$ bitcoin-cli -regtest -generate 1 -rpcwallet=testWallet2\r\nerror code: -19\r\nerror message:\r\nWallet file not specified (must request wallet RPC through /wallet/<filename> uri-path).\r\nTry adding \"-rpcwallet=<filename>\" option to bitcoin-cli command line.\r\n```\r\nAfter the fix, you will get this output instead:\r\n```\r\n$ bitcoin-cli -regtest -generate 1 -rpcwallet=testWallet2\r\nerror: Error: this is not a valid cli-command argument \"-rcpwallet=xx\", please check the syntax of the \"-generate\" command.\r\n```\r\nIf you remove `-rpcwallet` from the command above you will get:\r\n```\r\n$ bitcoin-cli -regtest -generate 1\r\nerror code: -19\r\nerror message:\r\nMultiple wallets are loaded. Please specify a wallet to use by requesting the RPC through the /wallet/<filename> URI path. \r\nUsing \"bitcoin-cli\", add the \"-rpcwallet=<filename>\" option before the command.\r\nRun \"bitcoin-cli -h\" for help or \"bitcoin-cli listwallets\" to see which wallets are currently loaded.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst version of this PR was only validating `-generate` cli-command, but since reviewers @kouloumos and @jonatack  recommended a more generic approach, the validation was moved up at the beginning of the function `CommandLineRPC` and it performs 3 more checks that are [mentioned below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26990#issuecomment-1446919139), on top of that, new test cases that go around those checks were added into the functional tests.",
