This would be useful for users who want to know the total number of addresses the node knows about and can make connections to. \r\n\r\nCurrently, `-addrinfo` returns total number of addresses the node knows about after filtering them for quality + recency using [`isTerrible`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4b51290f719559b8506425177f7758abe66fe2c3/src/addrman.cpp#L808). However `isTerrible`addresses [don't matter](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26988#discussion_r1147725684) when selecting outbound peers to connect to. Total number of addresses the node knows about could be higher than what `-addrinfo` currently displays. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24370.",
