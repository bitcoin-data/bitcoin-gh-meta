Bumping by exactly `DEFAULT_INCREMENTAL_RELAY_FEE` might then cause the bumped transaction to not get relayed.\r\n\r\nIn addition, because the GUI doesn't let the user specify the new fee rate yet (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/647), it would be very annoying to have to bump 20 times to increment by 20 sat/vbyte.\r\n\r\nHowever, when you use the `bumpfee` RPC and manually specify `fee_rate` this is a needless restriction.
