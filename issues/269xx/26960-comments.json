Otherwise there seems to be the risk that an `Assert` will eat linear time at runtime in the length of the message, even if the assert is not hit.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly: because if we start using these helpers to take `string_view`, they'd have to calculate the length of the array at run-time every time `Assert`/`Assume` functions are called, and since those are called quite a lot and most of the time we expect them not to fail (i.e. the `string_view`s go completely unused), that would be a waste. With `consteval` (I [think](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/consteval) it's since C++20 already?) that run-time complexity would be avoided since everything is inlined and calculated at compile-time. \r\n\r\nIf so, nit: worth adding a little `// TODO` comment to document that with C++20 we can use `consteval` and `string_view`? Personally, I find those quite helpful.",
