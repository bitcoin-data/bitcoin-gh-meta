Minimize surprises: `nullptr` cannot be confused with an `int`. `nullptr` also has a well-specified (very restrictive) type, and thus works in more scenarios where type deduction might do the wrong thing on `NULL` or `0`.\r\n\r\nFound by compiling the project with `-Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant` and fixing where appropriate (skipping false positives).\r\n\r\n",
