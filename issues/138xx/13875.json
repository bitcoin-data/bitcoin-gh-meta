As the original source comment for `unsigned int  nChainTx` says, that should last until the year 2030.\r\n \r\nWith SegWit the smallest possible transaction is 60 bytes (potentially increased to 65 with a future soft fork, see #15482), without a witness:\r\n\r\n```\r\n4 bytes version\r\n    1 byte input count\r\n        36 bytes outpoint\r\n        1 byte scriptSigLen (0x00)\r\n        0 bytes scriptSig\r\n        4 bytes sequence\r\n    1 byte output count\r\n        8 bytes value\r\n        1 byte scriptPubKeyLen\r\n        1 byte scriptPubKey (OP_TRUE)\r\n    4 bytes locktime\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat puts the maximum number of transactions per block at 16,666 so we might have to deal with this as early as a block 827,450 in early 2024.\r\n\r\nGiven that it's a memory-only thing and we want to allow users many years to upgrade, I would suggest fixing this in v0.20 and back-porting it.",
