But perhaps I was thinking of [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/13526#issuecomment-400146643) at the time.\r\n\r\n> Anyway I think if it should not be possible. For instance, it's not possible to dynamically add more RPC users Ã¢ÂÂ should it be possible? Beside, we use PUB/SUB which means that once the publisher is configured it can have multiple subscribers.\r\n\r\nThe usecase I had in mind here are front-end applications that hook onto a Bitcoin Core daemon.  If they need (for their particular situation) some ZMQ notification (e.g. block hashes), then they would be able to ensure that the currently running daemon supplies these notifications.  Without that, those applications could just throw an error at the end user and ask them to manually update their `bitcoin.conf`.\r\n\r\nSo I think this is a different situation from dyanmically adding RPC users.  Also adding multiple subscribers won't help, since the main reason for this feature is enabling (or disabling) notifications that are not turned on in the first place.\r\n\r\nThat said, I've not really had a strong need for this myself since when I opened the issue.  So we can happily close it if that seems not like a useful feature to you and others.",
