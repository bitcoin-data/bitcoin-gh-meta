Updating the label as well was the original behavior of `ok`, but the code for that has been changed around a \"few\" times (#1092, #858, #1080, #840) so it might be a regression. It is really hard to keep up with peoples expectations with the current form format.\n\nMaybe it would be  better if the label and address were shown as one visual entity, for example email-ish `label [address]` instead of two separate fields. This would prevent confusion as to what the label refers to (#1168) and problems like this, as the entire field is replaced at once.\n\nThe \"Ok\" button on the address book would be better to be explicit \"Choose Address\" when eh, choosing addresses.\n",

No matter what, there will always be someone complaining that the behavior is unintuitive, should be different, etc. In the end, it comes down to taste and individual habit, and we cannot take that into account for everyone.\n\nAs I've also said before \"People get confused about this all the time. The current behavior is not a bug, but a result from differing expectations\".\n\nWhat you are proposing would bring back issue #840.\n\nThe most dangerous problem, selecting the first address book entry automatically, was resolved. So unless someone has a great and very clear idea for reorganizing address/label entry that doesn't confuse anyone, we can close this issue.\n",
