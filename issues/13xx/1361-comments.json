I'm not a big fan of the 'grid' layout, though your boxes with Xs look nice to me, simply because I think it's harder to scan (e.g. to see all the values) and would leave less horizontal room for larger labels, URLs, and addresses... and I suspect a more tabular view would be more functional, if not as attractive.\n",

The only thing that would be new is the layout, but if it's not practical I'll close this again...\n\nI'm not entirely sure what you mean by \"grid\" layout though. I kept the entries small on purpose, to make it _easier_ to scan, like the recipient list in an email program such as outlook. This also makes it easier for users to see them as objects, instead of long, annoying to handle strings. Larger labels and addresses would not be an essential problem, they'd just make the boxes larger...\n",
