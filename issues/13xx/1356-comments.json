In the GUI OTOH I tend to agree.\n\nPerhaps make the verify box an input field, and if it's correct it instead tells you what the address should have been in the sorry you lose box?   This way use case that don't need to know the address in advance can still get it, but users are still encouraged to let the machine do the comparison.\n",
