   "body" : "This change improves debug.log output in the following ways:-\n\nIt reduces some duplicate output, and no longer needed output (which was originally added for testing).\n\nIt reduces the verbosity of output during initial block download, so rather than showing every block requested, it summarises. Once caught up, the previously level of verbosity is restored.\n\nInformation about the nodes connected are shown, and additional information about errors (particularly rejected transactions) are shown, with the offending peer alongside.\n\nRecent changes which add many lines, such as address handling have been kept in as this code is still relatively new - I was tempted to comment out various lines such as the \"tried...\", etc.\n\nTimestamps is now enabled by default. -nologtimestamps or logtimestamps=0 will disable this.\n\nAlso, renamed AlreadyAskedFor to AlreadyWaitingFor (makes more sense, as can cease waiting, but cannot stop having done a past thing.)\n",
