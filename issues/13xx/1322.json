HelpMessageBox class, as tr() does not work that early in the code\n\nI was wondering, why for example the translation for \"Usage:\" did not work, althoug it was in the (in my example) de language file. I found out that using the _() function does it's job and so I added 2 new functions in init.cpp to be able to get the strings translated and the translations used.\n\nThis needs an additional bitcoinstrings.cpp update!\n",
