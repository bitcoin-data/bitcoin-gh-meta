Client software can format it to the user however they want.\n(we do this consistently in other places too; e.g. we even report timestamps as numbers, and don't bother formatting them as date-times)\n\nIt's certainly not worth breaking the interface for. Also realize that a client may need this value to process further, not to show to the user: e.g. bitwise-AND operations should be done on a number, not a string, so this change may mean doing an _extra_ conversion from hex to int on the client side.\n\nNo strong opposition to adding it as extra field, though I'd still say adding a field to avoid an extra hex conversion on the client side is too much hand-holding. This shouldn't set a precedent to add hex, octal, binary for every field.\n",

I figured I'd throw this out there and see what other people thought.\n",

It can't be complete, but it can show the known ones. Tons of options for the unknown ones, one would be to show them as 'unknownXX' where XX is the bit. E.g. in UpdateTip logging we issue a warning per block, see #7795.\n\nIMO where to coordinate the bits is completely offtopic here :) It shouldn't happen in our repository at all, but indeed in BIPs.\n\n@mruddy Sounds good to me.\n",

I wanted to avoid redundancy for the easy to ascertain version numbers that are definitely treated as integers.\n\nI was trying to avoid being too specific to BIP9 because it allows for two future mechanisms (top bits 010 and 011). I thought of using `>= VERSIONBITS_TOP_BITS`, but that ignores [5, 0x1fffffff] which I think could be re-purposed too. I don't see any rule limiting that range's use to only being simple integers.\n\nI should probably just keep it simple and always display `versionHex`. My redundancy limiting kinda feels like unnecessary optimization.\n",
