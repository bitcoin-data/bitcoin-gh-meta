On regtest this change was definitely helpful for my local testing. On testnet3, because standard-ness validation is the default for what I was testing in current nodes, it's kind of sterile. I was having trouble getting relay and I couldn't find good info on current testnet miner policies or where I could submit to a miner that accepted non-standard testnet transactions (which makes sense, but it was kind of a pain).\n",
