But I was reading over the code trying to figure out why the fee estimates in 0.12 are seemingly such over-estimates, and can't find in the logic anywhere it would ignore empty blocks?\n\nBy empty block, I mean something like:\nhttps://www.blocktrail.com/btc/block/404921\n\nwhich is probably pretty useless for fee estimation purposes, and contributing to the effect that bitcoin can never estimate the fees required for 1 confirmation.\n",
