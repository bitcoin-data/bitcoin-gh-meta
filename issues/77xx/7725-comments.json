Can you get more information on the \"closes unexpectedly\" problem you're encountering with 0.12?\n\n> And today, I tried to uninstall it and reinstall v0.11.2 (which did not suffer from this). But when I run it, Windows says that the program exited unexpectedly, with no other information useful for troubleshooting. \n\nDid you follow the downgrade instructions that specifically say you must run with -reindex?\n\n> Do you not want people to use bitcoin anymore?\n\nNone of the current Bitcoin Core developers (AFAIK) use Windows, and it gets tested mainly by users during the release-candidate stage. So until someone reports a Windows-specific issue, we probably won't know about it.\n",

That should've worked no matter what unless there are registry entries or other configuration files I'm not aware of that didn't get deleted by the v0.12.0 uninstall.\n\nI cannot get anymore information about the \"program has exited unexpectedly\" message from Windows.
