Note that bitcoin-cli links the client library, not the server one.\n\n(another reason that it doesn't belong server-side is that it doesn't act on univalue/JSON objects, but on command line strings. Wouldn't  want string parsing on the server side, as this makes the JSON-RPC API unclear, and introduces potential vulnerabilities and DoS possibilities etc)\n",

It is an interesting thought but that would be a completely different proposal, and I don't think it would share any code with this. I'd imagine it would work something akin to batching (but w/ nested structures), not by parsing/formatting expression strings. Seeing how little even simple batching is used, I'm also not sure there is enough demand for that kind of advanced behavior, but that aside.\n\nEdit: Looked it up a bit,  'nested remote function call' in RPC protocols is commonly implemented in the form of 'promise pipelining', a strategy to reduce round-trips. A call can return a handle, which is essentially a temporary variable, which can be passed as argument to other calls before the result is known. This allows more versatile manipulation than just nesting (e.g. a DAG instead of a tree). In any case this is something to be found in the more advanced RPC frameworks, I couldn't find anyone having bolted it into JSON-RPC. As said, an issue for another time :)\n\nEdit.2: Had a try at a proposal here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8457#issuecomment-239611262\n",
