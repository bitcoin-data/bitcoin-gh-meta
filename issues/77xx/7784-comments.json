They are not magic values but just the mechanical result of subtracting valueOut from valueIn.  They used to just be random values but then mining code was changed to depend on the value in CTxMemPoolEntry instead of calculating it itself, and so I figured it was safer to put the right calculation in there and avoid spurious test errors.  I've been meaning to create a helper class to generate CTxMemPoolEntry's in tests for some time.  \n",
