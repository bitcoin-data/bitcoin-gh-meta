There is already rpc and/or command-line parameters in place to tell the mempool (implicitly) to treat one or more transactions differently when doing a fee-sanity-check. As the node who wants to fingerprint you does not know which params you run, fingerprinting would be hard? Am I missing something?\n\nNonetheless, #6726 limits the scope of `REJECT_HIGHFEE` to raw transactions. Once this is merged, a follow up commit will remove the fee check from the mempool completely and place it in the rawrpcwallet code. Effectively, the mempool should then no longer distinguish p2p, raw and wallet txs.\n",

I was just referencing to your PR title (\"Mempool should not reject wallet created transactions\"). In a world where the wallet and the mempool/node is decoupled, this won't work (out of the box) and would require a different concept of \"privileged transaction\" in the mempool (which i'm not sure if this would even make sense).\n\nI agree that the `bool fRejectAbsurdFee`-check does not belog to the mempool and was very likely done that way because there is currently now way to check wether a transaction would get accepted or rejected (tx inputs check).\n",

If that were the case, then they might expect their wallet (which hopefully is using reasonable fee estimates) to generate transactions that should be relayable and mineable by others, even if they happen to run with a configuration that might cause their own mempool not to accept it.\n\nHowever I can see the tradeoff with potential fingerprinting, and that sounds pretty bad as a potential outcome if a user is generating stuff that is non-relayable by their peers.\n\nAny suggestions on how we should handle this?  It's not clear to me exactly what functionality we want, and what the wallet user experience should be like for either of these situations:\n- a wallet tx wouldn't qualify for entry into the user's own mempool\n- a wallet tx gets evicted from the user's mempool after being accepted\n",
