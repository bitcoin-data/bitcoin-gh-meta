But it would also require signal catching for the context menu (Right-Mouse-Button->Menu->Copy) as well as for some linux copy'n'pase behavior (middle mouse button?).\n\nNot sure if it's worth hacking down a such implementation.\n\nIf somebody has interest to go down this rabbit hole, here is a starting point: https://github.com/jonasschnelli/bitcoin/commit/6ca2dbf99b240fbf8567357815f60b9609c00f9b\n\nAlthough: JSON pretty print and a short cut for directly opening the rpc console window would be nice!\n",
