Is the Linux kernel also that ugly in terms of include ordering, silly new-lines, wrong header naming in the ifdefs or as header end comments, wrong or missing indentations, wrong style for functions (where brackets aren't in a new line) etc... at least I've lost my motivation to contribute to that \"mess\" as even simple GUI pulls take forever to get in :-/.\n",
