To be slightly pedantic, you could view raising it to 5000 so mempools don't blow up as changing the meaning of it.  1000 is perfectly sufficient as a **relay fee** for now.  Almost every transaction that has ever been transmitted with a fee over 1000 has been mined, so that implies it's almost too HIGH of a fee as a min relay fee.  But I like raising it to 5000 and then revisiting in the context of #6722, possibly even lowering it again in backports in the future.\n",

This is worse for us than a hard fork, because for the hardfork you only need to update the node.\n\nOne alternative is to hardcode the limit of \"Dust\" to what it was before, I think you are raising this limit temporary anyway. The worse is that it is temporary ! Which mean that we will again need to go through the pain soon. If it is temporary, can't you change the Dust in a hardcoded value temporarily as well ?\n\nThe dust also does not change a lot for spamming ! Because you can just send those 600 satoshi to yourself so it does not cost you anything.\nReally, this is causing us unnecessary pain for something temporary and which can be fixed very easily by a hard coded value in IsDust() that we can reverse later :(\n",

The trouble I see here is that it has to be communicated to users/integrators, but this seems like the lesser evil than requesting that all other Bitcoin Core users change their settings manually.\n\nI'm not too familiar with the others, and if hardcoded values are used, then it's rather unfortunally. Probably a good time to change that though.\n\n> we'll take the blow, not knowing when it will happens again\n\nI'd recommend not to assume that node policies (e.g. default fees, dust thresholds, standard scripts etc.) never change. #3737 or #5231 are probably good examples to name in this context.\n",

It would probably be best to either use a very high value, which is certainly over the limit, or continuously update the threshold.\n",

However, I think this is a band-aid and does not address the real problem, which is that mempools will keep getting filled by tx using the lowest allowed fees.\n\nThe right solution for this is to have near-dust transactions as \"Fill or Kill\". That is, if a transaction is not confirmed within n blocks (say 5), it is dropped from the mempool (for non-high priority). This will require the sender to re-send.\n\nThe number of blocks can be a function of the fee. i.e. 1 satoshi = 1 block, 10 satoshi = 2 blocks, 100 satoshi = 3 blocks, 1000 satoshi = 4 blocks. 4000 satoshi can be 1 day. \n\nAnything over 4000 can be treated 'business as usual'\n",

But UTXO size is negligible compared to the blocks.\n\nBut let's admit : \"Saying that dust is uneconomic to spend is untrue with colored coin protocols.\" is true. If that is the case, dust should not be bound with minRelayTxFee but with the current fee rate, whatever it is at the moment of broadcast. This would simplify the code a bit, and would be consistant with the goal of not having \"uneconomic output\" and spare us with yet another magic default which can have some dramatic impact. (yes, I know people should not rely on the default in theory, but they do in practice)\n\nAs I said this rushed decision have more impact than a hardfork for wallet. If you have a coin of X btc and the user wants to send (X - 1000 satoshi) BTC, then before your modification, the change of 1000 satoshi would be sent back to the user, but after your modification, the change would prevent the transaction from spreading. So it requires everyone to rebuild/redeploy all of our users.\n\nThe interesting thing to note is that it is impossible in theory to know if an output will be more costly than its value to spend, because the price to spend depends on the fee rate at the time of spending, which can't be predicted. But well, I guess this is not a better approximation to use the fee rate instead of minRelayTxFee for that. \n",

There was quite a bit of discussion, which may be interesting to read: #2351, #2577 (also discusses colored coins)\n\n> But UTXO size is negligible compared to the blocks.\n\nSorry, can you please clarify? Mined outputs, or blocks can be prunned, while you can't just remove entries from the UTXO, which makes UTXO space more \"expensive\" than block space.\n\n> But let's admit : \"Saying that dust is uneconomic to spend is untrue with colored coin protocols.\" is true.\n\nI agree, but I'm not sure if this could be generalized. It's an exceptional case.\n\n> dust should not be bound with minRelayTxFee but with the current fee rate but with the current fee rate, whatever it is at the moment of broadcast\n\nI see where you're going: since the economic value of an output, when spending, is affected by the transaction fees, this should be the basis to determine the economic value. As such, this sounds reasonable to me. It probably doesn't make sense, if the thresholds were based on the fees of the sending transaction (e.g. think about a transaction with very high fee for fast confirmation - how does this relate to the spender at all?), but instead based on the context when spending (e.g. mempool size etc.). It seems to overlap, once mempool space becomes limited based on transaction fees though.\n\n> I know people should not rely on the default in theory, but they do in practice\n\nYou may assume certain defaults (or widely used values), and leverage that, but relying on it doesn't seem solid, and breaks, once the values change, either locally, say when a single node has a different policy, or more global, if default values change, and a large part of the network uses the new default.\n\nSince your mostly concerned about OA, I'm actually wondering how this is an issue for you, which is \nnot meant to sound offending, as your point cover more than OA. OA isn't a pure colored coins protocol, which uses output values to represent asset amounts, but instead more like meta protocol, which uses outputs to track the flow of assets.\n\nLet's say there were a network wide default static transaction fees of 0.00001 BTC, and you built a wallet, which always sends transactions with 0.00001 BTC transaction fees. At some point the default fees are raised to a static value of 0.00005 BTC. Or let's say, at some point the default fees are no longer static, but instead floating. Wouldn'd you agree that a wallet that assumes transaction fees of 0.00001 BTC should be overhauled at this point? Your situation is similar in my opinion.\n",

Wouldn'd you agree that a wallet that assumes transaction fees of 0.00001 BTC should be overhauled at this point? Your situation is similar in my opinion.\n\nI agree on this point, but dynamic fee is something people had time to adapt to. (even faster thanks to the spam attacks) \nSo there is lots of service which provide reasonable feerate to use. (I am using blockcypher)\nThe MinTxRelay fee has always been static, and this change as been precipitated. I'll take you an example on how it breaks wallet, even without OA.\n\nSay you want to send 1000 satoshi to Alice, but have a coin of 2100 satoshi. A wallet with MinTxRelayFee of 1000 will send the 1100 satoshi of change.\nBut if you change the MinTxRelayFee abruptly to 5000 like that and I don't update the wallet software, now, the transaction will be ignored because the change is considered Dust.\n\nSo my point are the following : \n- Does the \"Dust\" concept is really useful to protect some kind of attack ?\n- If you think it is, the definition should be based on tx fee to be consistent with the rational of \"not creating an output uneconomical to spend\"\n\nThe fee rate is a widely available value nowadays contrary to MinTxRelayFee, and also has been largely tested.\n\n> But UTXO size is negligible compared to the blocks.\n> Sorry, can you please clarify? Mined outputs, or blocks can be prunned, while you can't just remove entries from the UTXO, which makes UTXO space more \"expensive\" than block space.\n\nI was talking about non-pruned node, where the UTXO can't be bigger than the block directory anyway.\n\nFor pruned one, this is a whole other discussion, but briefly with pruned node you can't download blocks or merkle blocks from them (the service bit Network is not set).\nAny services which depend on a bitcoin node will always use non pruned node. For now I see pruned node as a way to keep the node count up artificially by making them less useful. Which is why I disregard the \"you can prune blocks, but not the utxo\" argument. Note that I do not follow closely what is planned next for pruned nodes, but as they are now, they help no one but the person who just wants a wallet without SPV. Whether this should be enough reason to justify Dust is a question with no easy answer sadly.\n\n>  It probably doesn't make sense, if the thresholds were based on the fees of the sending transaction (e.g. think about a transaction with very high fee for fast confirmation - how does this relate to the spender at all?), but instead based on the context when spending (e.g. mempool size etc.)\n\nIf I understand what you mean, you are saying it makes sense to block the _spending_ of an uneconomical output. If that is so, I don't agree because spending an output always reduce UTXO size and should never be denied. (also you don't want user not knowing whether they will be able to spend their coins in the future)\n\nWhat I meant is really doing just like now : blocking at the creation of uneconomic output, except based on the fee of the transaction instead of MinTxRelayFee. So we don't have external state to get to know what the dust is, and the dust value evolve nicely with how much it would cost to spend the output. (you can't really know how much it will cost to spend in the future, but at least you have the best guess you can get by using the fee of the transaction)\n\nIt makes sense to use the transaction fee instead of the fee rate, because the decision whether the transaction was accepted or not is priory based on the fee rate.\n\n> There was quite a bit of discussion, which may be interesting to read: #2351, #2577 (also discusses colored coins)\n\nI will check that.\n",
