      "body" : "@Diapolo: code style is something that can be done by `clang-format` and co. and does therefore not get the main attention. Bitcoin core code gets cleaner and not uglier IMO.\n\nI appreciate your cleanup pulls. But you often mix code-style changes with functional changes. That makes it hard(er) to review. And if you are working on other PRs, you need to decide if you do review one of your code-cleanup-PR or work on scalability-, feature- or refactoring-PRs. I think contributors often decide for the later.\n\nI would appreciate keeping \"drama\"-issues on a minimum. Working on a project like Bitcoin-Core requires extrem patience and a total focus on \"emotion-free\" tech-debate/contribution and discussions.\n",

These that were clear and focused have been merged almost immediately.\n",
