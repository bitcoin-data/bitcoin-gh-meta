Otherwise we can keep creating 'also allow XX' pulls (yes, I'm guilty of this one) .\r\n\r\nI think the conceptual issue is that `SanitizeString` is used for two purposes: \r\n- to avoid formatting strings that are dangerous to pass to the shell, terminal or debug log, and\r\n- to filter characters for user agent\r\n\r\nSplitting of these two use-cases with a parameter was a great idea. Now we can make SanitizeString(SAFE_CHARS_UA_COMMENT) pass through all characters allowed per BIP14.\r\n\r\n**Unfortunately**  that BIP isn't clear on that. It says that `/` `:` `(` and `)` are reserved, but it doesn't make any statement about e.g. which character set is used, or even about control characters...",
