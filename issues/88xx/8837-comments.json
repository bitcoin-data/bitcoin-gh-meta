I was wondering why `01000000000100000000000000000000000000` was given as a test case at all, as it seems very specific.\n\nMy understanding was that you were out to implement a \"blank\" segwit transaction in that test, and I think `010000000001000000000000` is a better representation, because it's very similar to the non-segwit bank tx `01000000000000000000`, only with the addition of the marker and flag.\n\n[edit]\nI agree that `010000000001000000000000` currently fails parsing, but I think that it shouldn't. :)\n",

In places where raw transactions are expected that consume inputs that are not necessarily complete, ambiguity is possible. This is the case for the decoderawtransaction and fundrawtransaction RPCs, and for bitcoin-tx. Since inputs to those are usually in fact not signed, they should usually not have any witnesses at all, and thus (trying to) decode without seems like a reasonable default.\n\nI do agree it's undesirable to have ambiguity in the first place, but I think a longer term solution will include a separate encoding for incomplete transactions. We may need that anyway for more complex signing such as for MAST and Schnorr, where the communication between the participants may include (primarily) information that does not end up in the final transaction.\n",

However, as @sipa notes above: \"those are usually in fact not signed, they should usually not have any witnesses at all, and thus (trying to) decode without seems like a reasonable default.\"\n- `decoderawtransaction` was updated to attempt to parse partial transactions here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/7030d9eb47254499bba14f1c00abc6bf493efd91#diff-01aa7d1d32f1b9e5a836c9c411978918L490 . `bitcoin-tx` was not updated at the same time.\n- this PR makes the same change to `bitcoin-tx` as was made to `decoderawtransaction` and adds test cases. This restores the pre-v0.13.1 behaviour and brings `bitcoin-tx` in line with `decoderawtransaction`\n",
