They can be written by copying the file `./test/functional/feature_backwards_compatibility.py` and modifying it to create a wallet with an older version, then check that it can be upgraded with a new version.\r\n\r\n#### Useful skills:\r\n\r\nExperience with the Bitcoin Core wallet and functional test suite.\r\n\r\n#### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this.
