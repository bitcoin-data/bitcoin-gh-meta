   "body" : "Catalina SDK clang stopped automatically searching the SDK include paths when invoked without `--sysroot`:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16367#issuecomment-594600985\r\n- https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/45061\r\n\r\nThis hasn't been a problem for current native depends packages because are passing their own `--sysroot` values, and hasn't been a problem for current host packages because they use `darwin_` commands instead of `build_darwin_` commands.  But the current `build_darwin_CC` and `build_darwin_CXX` commands are still unnecessarily fragile, and incompatible with new native depends packages added in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18677.\r\n\r\nCory Fields (theuni) suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16367#issuecomment-595393546 switching compiler from SDK clang to native clang (from $PATH) to avoid this problem. This is easy and makes a certain amount of sense for building native packages, as opposed to host packages. But Michael (fanquake) pointed out in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18677#discussion_r409934309 that it would be inconsistent to switch to non-SDK compilers while still using other SDK tools like `ranlib` and `install_name_tool`. So simplest, minimal fix seems to be just adding the missing `--sysroot` option.",
