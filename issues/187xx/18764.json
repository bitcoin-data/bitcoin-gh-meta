   "body" : "Many functional tests still use magic numbers for inventory types, either passed to the `CInv` constructor or for comparing the `type` member of `CInv`. This PR replaces all of those by constants in the module `test_framework.messages` that have been introduced in commit c32cf9f62285b5cd18a5064aee91f0802f0f87a8: `MSG_TX` (1) or `MSG_BLOCK` (2).\r\n\r\nIt also introduces a new constant `MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK` (naming as in `src/protocol.h`) and uses it to replace the remaining magic numbers.\r\n\r\nThe occurences of the magic numbers were identified through `grep`ing for `CInv(` and `type ==`. The idea was first to create a scripted-diff, but since also adding missing `import`s is needed, this would be non-trivial. Besides, also some unneeded comments like `# 2 == \"Block\"` could be removed.",
