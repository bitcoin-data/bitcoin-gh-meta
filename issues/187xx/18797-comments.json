      "body" : "Updated with only exporting a simple `verify_script_standard_with_amount` method, without flags passing, therefore making standard opaque to caller.\r\n\r\nI'm making the point again that this export isn't only useful for testing cases but also for production. Time-sensitive protocols like LN or Coinswap rely on confirming onchain transaction before some time-lock expiration. Doing so means they need to guarantee that these transactions broadcast smoothly on the currently deployed network, therefore have a higher concern with regards to policy. A flaw to adhere to standardness hinders their security.\r\n\r\nIt has been made the argument during the IRC meeting, that for these protocols, they have well-defined transactions format and also witnessScript, which is true. But standard rules don't scope themselves only on this in scriptPubKey validation, they may cover witness element not part of the script and not known before production. A rule like SCRIPT_VERIFY_WITNESS_PUBKEYTYPE  concerning pubkeys in witness v0 is such example.\r\n\r\nThese witness elements, unknown before protocol running, may be provided by a counterparty while a _cooperative_ witness construction to allow a spend of a multisig output. If this spent is time-sensitive, and therefore its good propagation a requirement, this counterparty input must be sanitized. A counterparty may have interest in your transaction not confirming.\r\n\r\nThat's where having a function like `verify_script_standard` is useful for applications. It's a better remedy than developers directly copy-pasting standard flags (like https://github.com/ACINQ/bitcoin-lib/blob/master/src/main/scala/fr/acinq/bitcoin/Script.scala), and taking the risk of non-updating for conformity at policy upgrade.\r\n\r\nA call to `testmempoolaccept` wouldn't fit for different reasons, given that an offchain transaction you're verifying may have an offchain parent too, and would be considered as an orphan by the mempool hindering other policy rule violation you're interested too. Fees is another issue as a minimal transaction feerate may be pre-agreed between parties and planned to be unilaterally RBF/CPFP'ed at broadcast.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I think enabling standardness verification at the script level make sense, as its correctness, disentangled from more-dynamic policy rules like packages size or fees, already avoid some issues for this class of applications.",

Not harder by re-implementing checks from Core, and still ensuring to byte-to-byte correctness. How can you optionally check expected future rules if they are not defined somewhere ? Do you think it's good software engineering practice to steal function from Core directly to achieve this like c-lightning is doing : https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/4302afd9a58f0c455bb812b63e9cdf377ebb74d4/bitcoin/signature.c#L214 ?\r\n\r\n> Sounds like an argument for enabling a chain of txs in testmempoolaccept :)\r\n\r\nI don't think policy/standard can be seen as a monolithic set of rules but instead can be dissociated, you do have adjustable local node policies (`-minrelaytxfee, -bytespersigop`, ...), per-release implementation transaction standards (minimal transaction size, scripts elements, ...), mempool DoS limits (BIP 125). AFAIK some of those checks are stateful, i.e depend of previous transactions seen by your mempool. Static rules compliance check shouldn't be blurred with dynamic ones and that's not what `testmempoolaccept` offer. Further how can you prevent your mempool to be sybilled and thus maliciously fail transaction verification ?\r\n\r\n> Test the highest-fee variant?\r\n\r\nWhat does mean highest-fee variant for a transaction which may be broadcast at an unknown time in the future ? Further testing the highest-fee variant means for a cooperative transactions you have signatures from both parties, how can you prevent a counterparty you don't trust to not broadcast the highest-fee variant ?\r\n\r\nTo resume, \r\n1) LN security model relies on confirmation of time-sensitive transaction those not _propagating_ through the network is a user fund risk.\r\n2) Propagating is ensured by compliance to _standard_ rules, as enforced by a high chunk of your local tx-relay topology through miner mempools. Given short timelock delay (< 10 blocks) you can't expect node operator intervention to modify transactions defaulting to conform to standard.\r\n3) Assuming these standard rules are well-defined (which I think it's not), higher-layer protocols should incorporate them in their specs. Applications should check their transactions compliance to these rules, both in their testing framework and in production when compliance can't be known ahead of time (like a witness element provided by counterparty). This evaluation should be fine-grained to avoid a dynamic rule evaluation being blurred with a static one.\r\n4) Dynamic rule compliance (like mempool min fee) should be anticipated by applications, i.e reacting to a poor-feerate by RBF/CPFP'ing their transaction after few blocks when they see their transactions not confirming.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit sad to say that but base layer \"standard\" rules are somehow part of LN \"consensus\" rules. Is this a design flaw ? Maybe, but ignoring this would mean to redesign significantly multi-party offchain protocols or any scaling solution. Is Lightning security model well-understood by the LN community itself ? Well that's work in progress. \r\n\r\nI would be glad to have discussion in another meeting if you think there are points we can't agree on or need to shed more lights on.",

It tells you nothing about the rest of the networks' policies.\r\n\r\n> Static rules compliance check shouldn't be blurred with dynamic ones\r\n\r\nThat's my point. All policy is dynamic. The only static rules are consensus rules (although even those can change with some conditions met).\r\n\r\n> What does mean highest-fee variant for a transaction which may be broadcast at an unknown time in the future ? Further testing the highest-fee variant means for a cooperative transactions you have signatures from both parties, how can you prevent a counterparty you don't trust to not broadcast the highest-fee variant ?\r\n\r\nIf you don't have the signatures, you can't ensure you can broadcast it later...?\r\n",

The material content of such rules is\r\nactually what is implemented by Core for a given release. Some of them are standardized in BIPs (but not all of them, like\r\nMINIMALIF). A lot of them can't be changed by user configuration like the script interpreter ones. For the ones which aren't\r\ndependent of a node operator and dynamic network conditions (like mempool feerate) an application should be able to test\r\nits transactions compliance with regards to a given version of Core. If you expect a high-level of Core nodes running\r\non the network, that would give you a reasonable expectation on the effective _propagability_ of your transactions.\r\n\r\nNow why do we have as standard BIP 125 or BIP 146 and not other Core policy rules ?\r\n\r\n> That's my point. All policy is dynamic. The only static rules are consensus rules (although even those can change with some conditions met).\r\n\r\nDynamic with regards to which context ?
