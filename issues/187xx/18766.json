   "body" : "If the `blocksonly` mode is turned on after running with transaction\r\nrelay enabled for a while, the fee estimation will serve outdated data\r\nto both the internal wallet and to external applications that might be\r\nfeerate-sensitive and make use of `estimatesmartfee` (for example a\r\nLightning Network node).\r\n\r\nThis has already caused issues (for example https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16840 (C-lightning), or https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/2562 (LND)) and it seems prudent to fail rather than to give inaccurate values.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #16840, and closes #16890 which tried to fix the symptoms (RPC) but not the cause as mentioned by sdaftuar :\r\n> If this is a substantial problem, then I would think we should take action to protect our own wallet users as well (rather than hide the results of what our fee estimation would do!).",
