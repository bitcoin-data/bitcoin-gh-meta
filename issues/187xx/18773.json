Please describe.\r\n\r\nAs a new contributor, I was confused thinking that the build_msvc folder was the only source of build setup instructions.\r\n\r\nDescribe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI think that moving the build_msvc README.md and related file set to the doc folder would make the setup process much clearer with all the options in one place.\r\n\r\nDescribe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nInstead of moving build_msvc, retitling the doc folder to make it visually explicit that it contains build instructions would also be effective.\r\n\r\nAdditional context",
