   "body" : "Short version:\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we could render \"disk fill via logging\" vulnerabilities unexploitable by introducing a mitigation like the one suggested in the \"up for grabs\" PR #19995. That PR was Concept ACK:ed by @naumenkogs, @laanwj and @jnewbery, but unfortunately closed due to lack of time. Volunteers welcome!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLong version:\r\n\r\nA disk fill attack is an attack where an untrusted party (such as a peer) is able to cheaply make your node log to disk excessively. The excessive logging may fill your disk and thus make your node crash either cleanly (best case: if disk fill rate is relatively slow) or uncleanly (worst case: if disk fill rate is relatively fast).\r\n\r\nIt is easy to accidentally introduce a disk fill vulnerability: all it takes is a `LogPrintf` in a code path which is easily and cheaply triggered by a remote attacker.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we could kill this vulnerability bug class by introducing a general mitigation mechanism which would remove the ability exploit such such a misplaced `LogPrintf`. (Our first line of defence would obviously be to never misplace a `LogPrintf`, but realistically logging mistakes happen and that's where mitigations kick in as a _second_ line of defence.)\r\n\r\nOne possible mitigation was suggested in PR #19995 which received Concept ACKs from @naumenkogs, @laanwj and @jnewbery. The reviewers came up with some good ideas for improvements which need to be implemented. Unfortunately I don't have time to implement those changes myself, but if someone is looking for \"up for grabs\" PRs then #19995 would be a very good choice. It is seldom one gets the chance to kill an entire vulnerability bug class :) I'd be glad to review and help out.\r\n\r\nThe solution suggested in the referenced PR is one of many possible solutions, but regardless of which solution we choose I think we need _some_ disk fill attack mitigation to kill this bug class once and for all :)",
