Please refer to these two to understand the design. My talk is [here](https://youtu.be/YxsjdIl0034?t=670) .\r\n\r\nThis PR supersedes the previous [one](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261), because that one got too much review comments (I tried to resolve all of them for this version), and also it was much refactored since then.\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\n\r\nErlay uses both flooding (announcing using INV messages to all peers) and reconciliation to announce transactions. Flooding is expensive, so Erlay seeks to use it sparingly and in strategic locations - only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections. Since every unreachable node is directly connected to several reachable nodes, this policy ensures that a transaction is quickly propagated to be within one hop from most of the nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nAll transactions not propagated through flooding are propagated through efficient set reconciliation. To do this, every node keeps a reconciliation set for each peer, in which transactions are placed which would have been announced using INV messages absent this protocol. Every 2 seconds every node chooses a peer from its outbound connections in a predetermined order to reconcile with, resulting in both sides learning the transactions known to the other side. After every reconciliation round, the corresponding reconciliation set is cleared.\r\n\r\nI think both paper and the BIP motives the changes, but Iâll mention them briefly once again here:\r\n* save 40% of the bandwidth consumed by a node\r\n* increase network connectivity for almost no bandwidth or latency cost\r\n* improves privacy as a side-effect\r\n\r\n### How to review\r\n\r\nI suggest reviewing in the following chunks:\r\n0. Minisketch (you can ignore this for now, a separate PR for that is coming)\r\n1. Registering for reconciliation (from âAdd helper to see tx relay support by conn typeâ to  âAssign some outbound peers we reconcile with for floodingâ)\r\n2. Populating reconciliation sets (from âTrack tx announcement protocol\r\nâ to ââReduce tx broadcast interval)\r\n3. Initial reconciliation phase (from âAdd peers to reconciliation queue on negotiationâ to âHandle reconciliation sketch and successful decodingâ )\r\n4. Extension phase (from âRequest extension if decoding failed\r\nâ to âHandle sketch extension)\r\n5. Finalization (from âAdd a function to get wtxids by shortidsâ to the end)",
