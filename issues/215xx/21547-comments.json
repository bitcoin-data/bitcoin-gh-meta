      "body" : "This is expected behavior. Bitcoin Core is not including a lot of addresses in the PSBT. It is including an entire previous transaction which happens to be enormous. Due to the way that signing works currently, many airgapped/offline/hardware signers need the entire previous transaction for each input in order to verify the correctness of amounts before they sign the transaction. As such, PSBT includes entire previous transactions. Sometimes this results in very large PSBTs when previous transactions are themselves large. In this case, the previous transaction for the input in this transaction is very large - it is 131953 bytes. You can see this in the `non_witness_utxo` field of the input.",
