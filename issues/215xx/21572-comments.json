      "body" : "> Nothing stops you from setting the\r\n> JSONRPCRequest member variable \"context\" to \"m_context\" instead of \"&m_context\" and you have exactly the same problem...\r\n\r\nIt's true the new code in #21574 doesn't stop you from writing `request.context = whatever` where _whatever_ could be any type. But that's just how std::any works. The reason I think #21574 would prevent this type of bug is just that it switches to clearly assigning an rpc request context, instead of passing an context argument to an intermediate function which could be accepting any type or value. Also the change would have required an update to the `#ifdef ENABLE_EXTERNAL_SIGNER` code block that was overlooked in the original PR because the old code still compiled even after it was no longer correct.\r\n\r\nAny case, thanks for reviewing this bugfix and feel free to post any concerns about #21574 in the thread there if there are problems with that cleanup or ways to improve it.\r\n",
