   "body" : "Look at my pretty harrmer, watch as I make everything into a nail!\r\n\r\nThis de-duplicates the NotifyBlockTip/BlockTipChanged callbacks by removing the NotifyBlockTip callback from ui_interface, cleaning up a few things along the way. It does, however, add a good bit of overhead where there was previously none - instead of a simple boost::signal things are now being called on the scheduler background thread. Still, I think its worth it because a) background-threading this stuff makes us less vulnerable to latency spikes in different subsystems because some other subsystem takes forever (at least once validationitnerface is parallel across different clients) and b) avoids lockorder issues creeping in due to cs_main complexity.",
