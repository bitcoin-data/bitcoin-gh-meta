Thats at least how I compiled everything on my Pi and my cheap servers.\r\n`fallocate -l 4G /swapfile && chmod 600 /swapfile && mkswap /swapfile && swapon /swapfile && swapon --show`\r\nAfter you've rebooted your system once, the swap will be gone again. You could make it permanent, but I think that cheap nodes usually dont have a lot of disk space aswell, so you should probably do it that way.\r\nHappy compiling!",
