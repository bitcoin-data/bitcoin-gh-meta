So therefore the final estimates should also be monotonically decreasing.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is the possibility that one of the sub-estimates is unable to return an estimate because there is no fee rate that is high enough to meet the threshold.  The algorithm was designed to just return the max of the other sub-estimates in this case with the reasoning being that it is better to give some estimate rather than give up and revert to the fallback fee or have a potentially computationally expensive search for the lowest target which is able to return all sub-estimates.   The downside of this is that if a higher target can return that sub-estimate, it might actually be higher than either of the other sub-estimates at the lower target and cause a final estimate which is actually greater for the higher target.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's not ideal, I think this falls in the category of \"won't fix\".  What is really happening in this edge case is that the estimate for the lower target is perhaps not as high as it should be.  But in analyzing a proper fix, I think that time would be better spent either doing a wholesale improvement to fee estimation, or working on better RBF or CPFP tools.\r\n\r\nI believe that given current fee markets this should be very unlikely on mainnet, and that if conditions were to arise that made this more likely, we probably need a better fee estimation algorithm anyway.  Also the raw data is accessible through estimaterawfee which could allow anyone to make their own more complicated combination of sub-estimates if they really care.\r\n\r\n",
