   "body" : "Sometime during normal operation, my node crashed (possibly due to this issue, but I do not know) and I had to perform a reindex. During this reindex, I noticed that it was consuming upwards of 26 GB of memory and constantly consuming more. Unfortunately this caused my computer to lock up and I had to reboot it to fix that. Starting Core again resulted in a reindex and the same behavior again.\r\n\r\nI am using a build of the current master branch on commit 00d25e90db06149fa456b0a8f15b7b68005ff9c5\r\n\r\nMachine info:\r\nUbuntu 17.10\r\n32 GB RAM\r\n\r\nI was going to run it in valgrind but it was taking too long to get anywhere remotely past initialization to the part where the memory leak was happening, so I killed that.\r\n\r\nNow I am doing `git bisect` to find where the leak was introduced. AFAIK this leak is not present in 0.15.1.\r\n\r\nI believe that @sipa experienced the same issue on his odroid but was not able to reproduce the problem.",
