I disagree with the [view](https://github.com/#issuecomment-4991036) that itâs worse to fail to start than start with a wrong wallet or with âfake rescanâ(or whatever else is passed and appears to work whereas it doesnât at all). \r\n\r\nThe above example illustrates how a fake rescan of a wrong (new) wallet results in no funds found, ie after your daemon starts you conclude that your old otherWallet.dat can be deleted because itâs empty.\r\n\r\nWhy put convenience before correctness when it comes to daemon startup options?\r\nNo one who didnât mess with their settings will have a problem starting service, and those who did shouldnât succeed to start it if they passed syntactically wrong options. \r\n\r\nI am okay if the maintainers close this because itâs a duplicate.\r\n \r\n",
