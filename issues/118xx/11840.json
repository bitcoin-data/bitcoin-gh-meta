   "body" : "I noticed while testing #11403 that there was no desktop notification (OSX) upon receiving a transaction. This is occasionally happening on master as well. I'm trying to find a reliable way to reproduce.\r\n\r\nSteps to (sometimes???) reproduce on master 497d0e014:\r\n1. launch QT a fresh (testnet) wallet\r\n2. generate receive address\r\n3. navigate to Overview tab\r\n4. use another wallet to send funds\r\n5. notice the transaction appears in the list\r\n6. notice no popup notification appears\r\n\r\nI'm not getting notifications for `v0.15.1` anymore either, both mainnet and testnet.\r\n\r\nRebooting OSX made this issue go away both on v0.15.1 as well as the SegWit WIP. So at least we can rule out that this has anything to do with #11403. Unfortunately I can't reproduce the issue after this reboot, so I'll continue debugging next time it happens.",
