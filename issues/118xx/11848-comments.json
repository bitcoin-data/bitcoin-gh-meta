      "body" : "Hi,\r\nyep I am using getmempoolentry/RPC after getting ZMQ message now in my app. Found a few days ago that I can do it that way. That is why I changed the description of the issue. It works well (still get some timeouts though).\r\n\r\nIs it not easier to expose that fee in a ZMQ event rather than do an RPC for every tx? I had cases when RPC-ing kileld bitcoind -> #11368. I beleive the whole point of ZMQ being in core is to minimize RPC where possible - but I can be wrong here.\r\n\r\nI am asking, as I do not know the answer here ...\r\n\r\nUsecases that I can think of:\r\n\r\n- bitcoin-qt to show average fee using ZMQ messages, basically without blocking bitcoind - but perhaps it has a way of doing it another way\r\n\r\n- it could make showing real-time fees easier for other services, like block explorers, etc. \r\n\r\n- e.g. electrumx server could use ZMQ to get those changing fees and perhaps let the clients directly listen to them, again helping to see the underlying market in action, without much of a hastle as ZMQ is really lightweight and can leave processing for the clients (doing averages, etc. , even letting new estimation algorithms to be implemented on non core wallets)\r\n\r\nI am not sure why we do not see more of services showing transactions and their fees in real-time, but perhaps doing ZMQ + RPC to get the information is one of the reasons (or just cause no body cares). I think one of the problems with high fees is that people do not really look at the price, they do not \"feel\" it is a changing thing. If we expose that to people, they can see the fees are dynamically changing and there is a market. Perhaps it could motivate them to not just blindly follow the calculation of wallets (lot of them advise too high fees), but check for them selves at a real-time fee showing service to have an idea what are the fees per TX. (Ideal would be to see that in their own wallet)\r\n\r\nRight now the fee market is not as affective as it could be, as the users mostly do not know of the underlying market. Perhaps, because it is not visible, they are used to real-time price updates from stock markets, etc. Could be an easy way to show them the market exists without doing much education.",
