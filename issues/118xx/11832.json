AFAIK a new block is created about every 10 minutes. No wonder that the syncing \"never\" finishes. This is going on for over a week now.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is some kind of DOS attack from malicious peer nodes?!?\r\nOr there is some multithreading related /(and/or ARM related) bug in the code; because CPU and network load is very low; yet the system makes little progress and is never the less VERY unresponsive.\r\n\r\nWhatever the reason, this is as it is, not usable at all. \r\n\r\nAre you guys testing your software on ARM SBC? This is what I'm using, it's $50:\r\n(ODROID HC1; 8 cores, 2GB RAM, SATA interface)\r\nhttp://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G150229074080\r\n",
