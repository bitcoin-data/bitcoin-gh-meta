What is your operating system and its version? If Linux, what is your desktop environment and graphical shell? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n\r\nIt can be reliable reproducible without any extra steps\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution**\r\nReturning the genesis block hash when target_confirmations exceeds the current block count\r\n\r\nNote: This is particularly useful on regtest, as on mainnet  you would need to call with \"640645\" (as of now) to get the described issue, but on a pristine regtest even using a value as low as 2 makes the returned value unsuitable for next calls.",
