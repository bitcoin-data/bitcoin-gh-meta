   "body" : "While reviewing #17204 I noticed that the errors in `input_errors` from `::SignTransaction` where being overridden by `CWallet::SignTransaction`. For example, a Script related error led to incomplete signature data which led to `CWallet::SignTransaction` reporting that keys were missing, which was a less precise error than the original one. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the error `\"Input not found or already spent\"` is [duplicated in `sign.cpp`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c7b4968552c704f1e2e9a046911e1207f5af5fe0/src/script/sign.cpp#L481), so the error here is redundant at the moment. So technically the whole error block could be removed, I think. However, this code is affected by the ongoing work on the wallet so there might be a reason why these errors are here. But even if there is a reason to keep them, I don't think existing, potentially more precise errors should be overridden here unless we want to hide them from the users. I am looking for feedback if this is a work in progress state where these errors could be more useful in the future or if they can be removed.\r\n\r\nOn testing: even though [the errors in `CWallet` are covered](https://marcofalke.github.io/btc_cov/total.coverage/src/wallet/wallet.cpp.gcov.html), all tests still pass after removing them. I am not sure if there is a desire to cover these specific error messages, tests in `test/functional/rpc_signrawtransaction.py` seem to aim for a more generic approach.",
