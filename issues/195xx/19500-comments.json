      "body" : "The downside of this request as phrased is that you end up with an additional end user tunable with no particular guidance on how to use it.  There is nothing wrong with it otherwise, but I think sumbtc's issue is more a symptom of the eviction logic being tor blind when it shouldn't be.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly concerning because tor peers are latency and reliability disadvantaged so on a mixed network host they're not likely to win at any of the anti-eviction criteria.  That's an oversight.\r\n\r\nI think that at a minimum the eviction logic should be made onion-aware by adding a step before the size()/2 longest uptime peers that protects the size()/4 longest uptime localhost peers, and then subtracts what it protected from the number of longest uptime peers it protects... so still half longest uptime, but up to half of those from localhost even if they weren't the longest uptime overall.\r\n\r\nOne could go further and split other criteria the same way, but I doubt its worth the complexity to go that far, maybe just the blocks criteria if someone wanted to go further.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Things are looking good now.  For default values (125 max connections) the possible eviction kicks-in at 114 inbound peers and onion peers are well protected. I now see up to 125 connections of which around 21 are inbound onion peers. However, at the moment my testing capabilities are limited because sometimes I have problems with my external internet cable (oxidation and leakage which will be repaired September 25). I expect more in depth analyses from your side with the `-netinfo` dashboard but from what I've seen the issue is resolved and can be closed. Suggestion: maybe this a good opportunity to also think about what happens to outbound onion peers?\r\n",

While writing a patch, I found myself gated on how to write functional tests before proposing the change, which is why I opened #19731 in addition to #19643. Until the test coverage groundwork is done or possibly just the patch proposed in #19670 is merged, it may be fine to leave this issue open? Looking forward to hearing more feedback from you over time.",
