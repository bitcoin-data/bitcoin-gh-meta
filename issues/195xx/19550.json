I think this can be helpful for many users, especially since there are some new index candidates coming up (#14053, #18000) that can give a quick overview without the user having to parse the logs.\r\n\r\nFeature summary:\r\n- Adds new RPC `listindices` (placed in Util section)\r\n- That RPC only lists the actively running indices\r\n- For each index it gives the name, whether it is synced and up to which block height it is synced\r\n",
