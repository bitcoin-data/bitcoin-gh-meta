   "body" : "The [libtapi we build in depends](https://github.com/tpoechtrager/apple-libtapi) builds a ClangBasic target. This is currently LLVM Clang 6.0.1, as that repository has a copy of Apples swift-clang repository at this commit: https://github.com/apple/swift-clang/commit/3c8cb332b1fed69f67aecfd56675b0ff297f2a01. You'll also see in our depends build output:\r\n```bash\r\n-- Looking for sys/resource.h\r\n-- Looking for sys/resource.h - found\r\n-- Clang version: 6.0.1\r\n-- Performing Test CXX_SUPPORTS_NO_NESTED_ANON_TYPES_FLAG\r\n-- Performing Test CXX_SUPPORTS_NO_NESTED_ANON_TYPES_FLAG - Success\r\n-- TAPI version: 10.0.0\r\n-- Supported Architectures: i386;x86_64;x86_64h;armv4t;armv6;armv5;armv7;armv7s;armv7k;armv6m;armv7m;armv7em;arm64\r\n-- Performing Test LINKER_SUPPORTS_NO_INITS\r\n-- Performing Test LINKER_SUPPORTS_NO_INITS - Failed\r\n-- Configuring done\r\n-- Generating done\r\n-- Build files have been written to: /bitcoin/depends/work/build/x86_64-apple-darwin16/native_cctools/55562e4073dea0fbfd0b20e0bf69ffe6390c7f97-8eb3b80cace/libtapi/build\r\n\r\n## Building clangBasic ##\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that we've just moved to Clang 8.0.0 in depends for macOS builds, and generally we like to keep all these things \"in sync\", we should check if anything needs to be done here. Updating this would require upstream to reintegrate it's repo with a newer LLVM,  which should be https://github.com/apple/llvm-project, given Apple has deprecated swift-clang.\r\n\r\nOpening an issue to remind myself but if anyone else wants to take a look please do.",
