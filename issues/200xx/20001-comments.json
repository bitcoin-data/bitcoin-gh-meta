I don't have any strong opinion.\r\n\r\nI'm happy as long as we fix this privacy gotcha :)\r\n\r\n> There is no such thing as a \"default proxy server\".\r\n\r\nTechnically you're right of course, but I'd assume that >95% of our users use `-proxy=127.0.0.1` (which is equivalent to `-proxy=127.0.0.1:9050`).\r\n\r\nFWIW, we already have a default proxy port (9050).",
