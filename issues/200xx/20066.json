   "body" : "Appveyor builds started failing about 20 hours ago for no reason I can discern.\r\n\r\nI cannot replicate the failures on my Windows 10 machine. I am able to install the vcpkg dependencies from scratch and successfully build Bitcoin Core using the `msvc` build config.\r\n\r\nI am attempting to replicate the issue in the appveyor job on my Bitcoin Core fork but as yet have not been able to narrow it down.\r\n\r\nIf anyone reads this with admin privileges for appveyor could you use the **RE-BUILD COMMIT** option on the [last successful](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/DrahtBot/bitcoin/builds/35532413) appveyor job. If that job now also fails it would point to something changing in the appveyor environment.",
