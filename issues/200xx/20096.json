   "body" : "We never have multiple threads making able to multiple `WalletBatch`s due to the extensive use of `cs_wallet`, `cs_KeyStore, and `cs_desc_man`, so the use of refcounting to handle the case where that may happen is unnecessary. Thus we can use an assert to enforce that only one `BerkeleyBatch` is accessing the `BerkeleyDatabase` at a time. The only instances where multiple `BerkeleyBatch`s were being created were where one was made in a caller function, and then the called function created another for itself. For those cases, we instead either pass in the caller's `WalletBatch` or limit the scope of the caller's `WalletBatch` so that there are no overlaps.\r\n\r\nThe refcounting in `BerkeleyDatabase` is kept because it did more than just count the number of `BerkeleyBatch`s, it also indicated when the database was flushed. However the `AddRef` and `RemoveRef` functions have been removed from `WalletDatabase`.",
