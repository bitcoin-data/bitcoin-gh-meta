It synced up to 6% and now says: \"Error: A fatal internal error occurred, see debug.log for details\"\r\n\r\nI don't know anything about coding so if some one can guide me through the process step by step it would be great.\r\n\r\nAlso I already transferred money into the wallet while it was syncing but now i cannot recover it and it never was even fully synced! Can someone please help me?",
