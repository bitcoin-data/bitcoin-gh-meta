   "body" : "    Previously, we did not persist the $PATH env var between bitcoin's\r\n    configure-phase and its make-phase.\r\n\r\n    This meant that when configuring with $CONFIG_SITE set to one generated\r\n    by depends, we would be configuring with $depends_prefix/native/bin\r\n    prepended to $PATH, as described in depends/config.site.in.\r\n\r\n    However, when make-ing, the $PATH would be set to whatever the caller's\r\n    environment is, which didn't include $depends_prefix/native/bin.\r\n\r\n    To work around this, we:\r\n\r\n    1. Prepended $depends_prefix/native/bin to our CC, CXX, AR, RANLIB,\r\n       NM, and STRIP in order to invoke them with a full path as argv[0].\r\n    2. Manually prepended $depends_prefix/native/bin to $PATH in our\r\n       Gitian/Guix builds.\r\n\r\n    These workarounds are not ideal, and there is a better way. Essentially\r\n    we want to make sure that what we feature-test at configure-time _is_\r\n    what we will run at make-time.\r\n\r\n    -----\r\n\r\n    Using AC_ARG_VAR we ensure the following properties:\r\n\r\n    0. We no longer need the 2 workarounds described above. (They are\r\n       dropped in later commits)\r\n    1. By default and without any overrides, whatever $PATH is at\r\n       configure-time, is whatever $PATH is at make-time.\r\n    2. When configuring with depends' CONFIG_SITE, the\r\n       $depends_prefix/native/bin prepend to $PATH stays there unless\r\n       overridden manually by a ./configure PATH=... or make PATH=...\r\n\r\n    I believe that this makes using our depends system and our build system\r\n    much more consistent, and still allows overrides to be easily made by\r\n    those who need it.",
