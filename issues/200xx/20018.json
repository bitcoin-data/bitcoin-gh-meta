   "body" : "If the user runs: `bitcoind -connect=X -seednode=Y`, I _think_ it is safe to ignore `-seednode`. A more populated `addrman` (via `getaddr` calls to peers in `-seednode`) is not useful in this configuration: `addrman` entries are used to initiate new outbound connections when slots are open, or to open feeler connections and keep `addrman` from getting stale. This is all done in a part of `ThreadOpenConnections` (below [this line](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net.cpp#L1803)) which is never executed when `-connect` is supplied. With `-connect`, `ThreadOpenConnections` will run [this loop](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net.cpp#L1785) and exit thread execution when interrupted.\r\n\r\nReviewers may also find it relevant that when `-connect` is used, we [soft disable](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/init.cpp#L800) `-dnsseed` in init.cpp perhaps for the same reason i.e. seeding is not useful with `-connect`.\r\n\r\nRunning `ProcessAddrFetch` does not seem to have downside except developer confusion AFAICT. I was confused by this and felt it might affect other new bitcoiners too. If there is strong preference to not remove the line, I'd also be happy to just leave a comment there mentioning `ADDR_FETCH`/`-seednode` is irrelevant when used with `-connect`.\r\n\r\nIf this change is accepted, the node will still make `getaddr` calls to peers in `-connect` and expand `addrman`. However, disabling those `getaddr` calls would leak information about the node's configuration.",
