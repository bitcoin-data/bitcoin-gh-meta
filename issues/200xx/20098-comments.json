If the icon is changed for bitcoin-core https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/100 and not here both icons would be black, which would be confusing from a brand perspective. \r\n\r\nWhat is the reasoning behind having the bitcoin, bips libbase58 and libblkmaker repos separate from the bitcoin-core account? Apologies, I am probably missing some context here. ",

The reason bitcoin/bitcoin hasn't been moved to bitcoin-core is that some external services/scripts might depend on it living under bitcoin/bitcoin.
