      "body" : "@MarcoFalke I found it much easier for reasoning and for rebases to have each commit focus on one function and do mechanical changes for its callers because:\r\n\r\n1. Say that the function in focus references `BlockManager`, we may think that the function's caller only needs `BlockManager` right now, but it may turn out that the caller calls another function which references `::ChainstateActive()` that we haven't pruned yet and we won't know what the caller actually needs until we've pruned _everything_ under the caller.\r\n1. Doing mechanical changes allows us to express more of the changeset as scripted-diffs. Which, for a large, mostly move-only project like this one, will make review and rebases a lot easier.\r\n    - A scripted-diff example of `implicit global -> g_chainman`: [`0e101a0` (#20050)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20050/commits/0e101a01832f8f799326faba27ffc97d73f8b434)\r\n\t- A scripted-diff example of `g_chainman -> m_chainman`: This is unpublished but I do something similar to the below for `rest.cpp`, `rpc/`, `tests/`, `interfaces/node.cpp`, `interfaces/chain.cpp`, etc.\r\n\t```\r\n\t-BEGIN VERIFY SCRIPT-\r\n    sed -i -e 's/g_chainman/EnsureChainman(context)/g' -- src/rest.cpp\r\n    sed -i -e 's/::Chain\\(state\\|\\)Active()/EnsureChainman(context).ActiveChain\\1()/g' -- src/rest.cpp\r\n    -END VERIFY SCRIPT-\r\n\t```\r\n\tNote that each \"module\" (`rest`/`rpc`/`tests`/etc) in our codebase may reference `ChainstateManager`/`CChainState`/etc slightly differently. So even though doing the caller changes mechanically may look ugly in intermediary commits, they:\r\n\t1. Are easier to reason about w/re correctness\r\n\t2. Delay having to think about the \"module-specific\" way to reference objects until we've pruned up to said module, whereby they will 100% be cleaned up and in a lot of cases we can apply a \"module-specific\" `scripted-diff` like above.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that, the above is just my personal take on how to bring some sanity to this unruly call graph (~40 commits just to clean up `validation`). I do understand that at the end of the day, what matters is what is clearer for reviewers, so if the benefits I described above do not sound worthwhile, I'd be happy to go with whatever reviewers think is best! :relaxed: ",

To me, ease-of-review and correctness is the most important thing, even if intermediary commits look a bit ugly, and especially when that ugliness will go away in followups. At the same time, it is super important to me that I'm not doing anything that makes review harder, so I very much value your honest feedback!\r\n\r\nIn order for me to better understand your thinking, perhaps we can go through a concrete example: the commits where I \"prune a leaf\" by moving `LookupBlockIndex` to `BlockManager` in #20050. Namely: ace764fdb0e749d47d8e6bb500f3bb96f45a9d28 and 0e101a01832f8f799326faba27ffc97d73f8b434. What I think you're proposing is that instead of leaving the \"use the right local reference\" work until we prune up to the caller, we should either add on to the first commit ace764fdb0e749d47d8e6bb500f3bb96f45a9d28 or have an additional commit which uses local references to `ChainstateManager` as soon as possible like so:\r\n\r\n1. For `src/rpc` calls to `LookupBlockIndex`\r\n\t1. Insert a `ChainstateManager chainman = EnsureChainman(request.context)` at the beginning of each lambda I touch if not already there\r\n\t1. Use the inserted chainman for `LookupBlockIndex` like: `chainman.m_blockman.LookupBlockIndex(...)`\r\n1. For `src/interfaces` calls to `LookupBlockIndex`\r\n\t1. Use `m_node.chainman->m_blockman` for `LookupBlockIndex` like: `m_node.chainman->m_blockman.LookupBlockIndex(...)`\r\n1. For `src/net_processing.cpp` `PeerManager` methods that call `LookupBlockIndex`\r\n\t1. Use `m_chainman` for for `LookupBlockIndex` like: `m_chainman.m_blockman.LookupBlockIndex(...)`\r\n1. For `src/test` calls to `LookupBlockIndex`\r\n\t1. Use `m_node.chainman->m_blockman` for `LookupBlockIndex` like: `m_node.chainman->m_blockman.LookupBlockIndex(...)`\r\n\r\nI also want to know what you mean by:\r\n\r\n> if there is a class that simply depends on the chainstate or block tree (like `BaseIndex` or `PeerManager` or ...) it might be best to pass it a reference to the chainstatemanager as early as possible\r\n\r\nRight now, I add an `m_chainstate` member to `BaseIndex` once I've pruned everything underneath it. It seems that you would like for that member to be added as early as possible, and I'm guessing it's so we can use it while pruning `LookupBlockIndex` like so:\r\n\r\n1. For `src/index` calls to `LookupBlockIndex`\r\n\t1. Use `m_chainstate.m_blockman` for `LookupBlockIndex` like: `m_chainstate.m_blockman.LookupBlockIndex(...)`\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I'm understanding you correctly, and thank you for your patience with me :sweat_smile: ",
