The reason I'm convinced of this is that, every day when I turn the machine back on, Bitcoin Core (and only that program) appears to have been uncleanly shut down/killed suddenly, as it keeps having to resync the last several days. (Perhaps just verifying the local data rather than actually downloading it.)\r\n\r\nI even tried keeping the Bitcoin Core GUI window open while shutting down one day, and I noticed that it didn't say the usual \"Shutting down\" text.\r\n\r\nWhether this is Bitcoin Core's fault, Windows 10's fault, or a combination, the fact remains that this happens every single time now, and it's very annoying and worrying.\r\n\r\nIs this issue known? Is it being worked on? What could be causing it? Would MS really change something fundamental about how applications are signaled when shutting down the OS in a minor update? (Not unthinkable.)\r\n",
