   "body" : "Even after #17458, we still deal with setting fees of an `OutputGroup` and filtering the `OutputGroup` outside of the struct. We currently make all of the `OutputGroup`s in `SelectCoins` and then copy and modify them within each `SelectCoinsMinConf` scenario. This PR changes this to constructing the `OutputGroup`s within the `SelectCoinsMinConf` so that the scenario can be taken into account during the group construction. Furthermore, setting of fees and filtering for effective value is moved into `OutputGroup::Insert` itself so that we don't add undesirable outputs to an `OutputGroup` rather than deleting them afterwards.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate fee calculation and effective value filtering during `OutputGroup::Insert`, `OutputGroup` now takes the feerates in its constructor and computes the fees and effective value for each output during `Insert`.\r\n\r\nWhile removing `OutputGroup`s in accordance with the `CoinEligibilityFilter` still requires creating the `OutputGroup`s first, we can do that within the function that makes them - `GroupOutput`s.",
