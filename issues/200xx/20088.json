   "body" : "Having different fuzz targets is useful to give the fuzzer a specific and well defined task to work on. This makes it also easier for developers to see what an individual fuzz test/target is doing. Moreover, the fuzzer might be more performant in finding new inputs because the input directory as well as the search space is smaller.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are also several downsides:\r\n\r\n* Limiting the overall search space the fuzzer can explore will make it impossible to reach coverage for the code paths that have been excluded.\r\n* Building numerous small fuzz targets, instrumenting them and linking them with debug symbols is costly in CPU time and disk space. A quick build is not only important for devs, but also for CI.\r\n\r\nSimilar to how the unit tests are compiled and linked into one binary, we could look into linking the fuzz targets into one binary. Individual targets could be selected with some kind of runtime argument.",
