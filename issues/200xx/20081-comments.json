      "body" : "I'm sorry, I guess I wasn't clear as to why I believe this is happening. Bitcoin-QT is trying to find any local wallets. Default setting created wallets beyond the initial wallet are stored in folders in the Data Directory. When I try to open a different wallet, Bitcoin-QT searches the Data Directory for folders with possible wallets in them, and it finds the System Volume Information folder, and tries to access it, then it crashes. At least without a dive into the code, that is what it looks like is happening. This only happens when the Data Directory is set to the Root of a Hard Drive because that is where the System Volume Information folder is. All I had to do was move the Data Directory into a folder a step up from the Root of the Drive and this was no longer an issue. I guess a fix would be for Bitcoin-QT to recognize that any folder named System Volume Information is off limits, or at least stop trying to access it if it fails. By the way, this also happens when just running bitcoind.exe and bitcoin-cli.exe getwalletdir, so it isn't just Bitcoin-QT that is affected.\r\nHere is my bitcoin.conf if that helps.  \r\n`server=1\r\ntxindex=1\r\ndaemon=0\r\nzmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332\r\nzmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:28333\r\nassumevalid=0`",
