   "body" : "It appears that there is a bug in certain GCC releases (in the version 9 and 10 series) where an optimization step breaks correctness of `memcmp` when at least one of the arguments is a compile-time constant array that contains at least one zero byte.\r\n\r\nGCC bug is here: https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=95189. It was stumbled upon by @roconnor-blockstream in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/822. It is being tracked for libsecp256k1 in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/823.\r\n\r\nI have verified that in some instances it also affects C++, and may even affect `std::lexicographical_compare`.\r\n\r\nThis may be relevant in some of our code (in particular, the `CNetAddr` IP range checking does comparisons with constants that contain zeroes, but perhaps more).\r\n\r\nSolutions:\r\n* Build with `-fno-builtin-memcmp`, but we should measure performance impact.\r\n* Very carefully inspect the codebase for potential cases, and use a custom memcmp for those.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [ ] Verify if compiler-generated memcmp calls may be affected as well",
