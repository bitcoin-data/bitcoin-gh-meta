The external port would still appear as `XXXXXXXXX.onion:8333`, however internally it would redirect to a that port.\n\nIn the case of `torcontrol` this would be easy to set up automatically. It could add a new (localhost) binding port automatically and this code would have to be changed:\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/torcontrol.cpp#L441\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/torcontrol.cpp#L477\n",
