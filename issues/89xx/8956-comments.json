In general, if we can't get sufficient testnet nodes due to scaling issues, that's a warning sign for Bitcoin as well.\n\nHaving said that, I do agree that in general we want to ensure that testnet coins remain valueless; a special \"faucet\" output that isn't removed from the UTXO set after spending it may be a good solution here.\n",
