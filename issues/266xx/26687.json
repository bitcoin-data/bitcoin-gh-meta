   "body" : "A user reported to me that they are unable to create a PSBT with a legacy watchonly wallet when they use the GUI. They get an error \"The amount exceeds your balance\".\r\n\r\nI think the issue is that the GUI will retrieve the wallet's balance via `AvailableCoins` before calling `CreateTransaction`. This call to `AvailableCoins` is resulting in fewer coins being returned with recent changes to how `AvailableCoins` works, particularly with additional filtering of spendable coins and preset coins.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nNote that this does not effect descriptor wallets. A workaround for this issue is to switch to using descriptor wallets. An existing legacy wallet can be turned into a descriptor wallet using the `migratewallet` RPC. However many watchonly legacy wallets are likely the result of importing descriptors via `importmulti`. For such wallets, I recommend creating a new descriptor wallet and re-importing the descriptors.",
