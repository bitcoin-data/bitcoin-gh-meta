   "body" : "Fixes #18603 \r\n\r\nChecks that generated files with special compilation units do not contain disallowed sections. Special instructions and disallowed sections are defined in the script and include `SSE42`, `SSE41`, `AVX`, `AVX2`, `SHANI`, and `.text.startup`, respectively. \r\n\r\nThe script uses `glob` to search and `lief` to parse files. If any disallowed sections are found in a file the script will print an error to `stderr` and exit with a non-zero exit code. Otherwise, the script will exit with a zero exit code indicating success.\r\n\r\nI also have another version on [this branch](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...willcl-ark:bitcoin:18603_si_check_test) which more closely mimics the interface of `symbol-check.py` (accepting a list of files as arguments), along with including a test which can be used to check that the script itself is working, but as it's quite a lot more code overall, I thought this branch might be preferable...",
