Rather than tagging a 24.1, which would give the false impression of a more stable point release, containing a number of bug fixes after months of 24.0 running in production, it's more appropritate to incorporate these additional fixes into 24.x, essentially consider 24.0 DOA, and tag a 24.0.1.\r\n\r\n> Or is the wallet bug less severe than thought?\r\n\r\nEverything I've seen, and been told, is that the wallet issue is significant enough to warrant a 24.0.1.",

Or is the wallet bug less severe than thought?\r\n\r\nit's pretty severe in that it affects users doing manual input selection, either in the GUI via coin control or via the RPC, which I think warrants nuking v24.0. \r\n\r\n> I don't see why that would involve going back to X.Y.Z versions. The way things stand, this should be v24.1, while v24.0 gets deleted (or not; irrelevant to the next version number).\r\n\r\nI'm not super familiar with semantic versioning, but v24.0.1 feels more appropriate as this isn't really a major update and more just replacing v24.0 with a bugfix",
