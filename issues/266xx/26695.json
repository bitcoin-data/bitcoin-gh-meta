   "body" : "Performance of block template building matters as miners likely want to be able to start mining on a block with transactions asap after a block is found. We would want to know if a mempool PR accidentally caused, for example, a 100x slowdown. An `AssembleBlock()` bench exists, but it operates on a mempool with 101 transactions, each with 0 ancestors or descendants and with the same fee. Adding a bench with a more complex mempool is useful because (1) it's more realistic (2) updating packages can potentially cause the algorithm to take a long time.",
