   "body" : "This PR fixes a bug and improves the mempool accept interface to return information more predictably.\r\n\r\nBug: In package validation, we first try the transactions individually (see doc/policy/packages.md for more explanation) and, if they all failed for missing inputs and policy-related (i.e. fee) reasons, we'll try package validation. Otherwise, we'll just \"quit early\" since, for example, if a transaction had an invalid signature, adding a child will not help make it valid. Currently, when we quit early, we're not setting the `package_state` to be invalid, so the caller might think it succeeded. Also, we're returning no results - it makes more sense to return the individual transaction failure. Thanks instagibbs for catching https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038#discussion_r1013293248!\r\n\r\nAlso, make the package results interface generally more useful/predictable:\r\n- Always return the feerate at which a transaction was considered for `CheckFeeRate` in `MempoolAcceptResult::m_effective_feerate` when it was successful. This can replace the current `PackageMempoolAcceptResult::m_package_feerate`, which only sometimes exists.\r\n- Always provide an entry for every transaction in `PackageMempoolAcceptResult::m_tx_results` when the error is `PCKG_TX`.",
