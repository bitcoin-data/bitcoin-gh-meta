   "body" : "## The Problem\r\nIf you run `test/get_previous_releases.py -b` on an M1 or M2 mac, you'll get an unsigned v23.0 binary in the arm64 tarball. macOS [sets stricter requirements on ARM binaries](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26996578) so the unsigned arm64 binary is apparently completely unusable without being signed/notarized(?).\r\n\r\nThis means that any test that depends on a previous release (e.g. `wallet_backwards_compatibility.py`) will fail because the v23.0 node cannot launch:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTestFramework (ERROR): Assertion failed\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/kdmukai/dev/bitcoin-core/test/functional/test_framework/test_framework.py\", line 563, in start_nodes\r\n    node.wait_for_rpc_connection()\r\n  File \"/Users/kdmukai/dev/bitcoin-core/test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py\", line 231, in wait_for_rpc_connection\r\n    raise FailedToStartError(self._node_msg(\r\ntest_framework.test_node.FailedToStartError: [node 2] bitcoind exited with status -9 during initialization\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can also be confirmed by downloading bitcoin-23.0-arm64-apple-darwin.tar.gz (https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-23.0/) and trying to run any of the binaries manually on an M1 or M2 mac.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution in this PR\r\n(UPDATED) Per @ hebasto, we can self-sign the arm64 binaries. This PR checks each binary in the previous release's \"bin/\" and verifies if the arm64 binary is signed. If not, attempt to self-sign and confirm success.\r\n\r\n(note: an earlier version of this PR downloaded the x86_64 binary as a workaround but this approach has been discarded)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Longer term solution\r\nIf possible, produce signed arm64 binaries in a future v23.x tarball?\r\n\r\nNote that this same problem affects the new v24.0.1 arm64 tarball so perhaps a signed v24.x.x tarball would also be ideal?\r\n\r\nThat being said, this PR will check all current and future arm64 binaries and self-sign as needed, so perhaps we need not worry about pre-signing the tarball binaries. And I did test a version of `get_previous_releases.py` that includes the new v24.0.1 binaries and it successfully self-signed both v23.0 and v24.0.1, as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Further info:\r\nSomewhat related to: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15774#issuecomment-1265164753\r\n\r\nAnd @ fanquake noted on IRC that you can confirm which binaries are or are not signed via:\r\n```\r\n$ codesign -v -d bitcoin-qt\r\nbitcoin-qt: code object is not signed at all\r\n```\r\n",
