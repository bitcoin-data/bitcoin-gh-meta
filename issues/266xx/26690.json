   "body" : "Instead of having database cursors be tied to a particular `DatabaseBatch` object and requiring its setup and teardown be separate functions in that batch, we can have cursors be separate RAII classes. This makes it easier to create and destroy cursors as well as having cursors that have slightly different behaviors.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since reading data from a cursor is a tri-state, this PR changes the return value of the `Next` function (formerly `ReadAtCursor`) to return an Enum rather than the current system of 2 booleans. This greatly simplifies and unifies the code that deals with cursors as now there is no confusion as to what the function returns when there are no records left to be read.\r\n\r\nExtracted from #24914",
