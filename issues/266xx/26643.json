   "body" : "Currently the fee underpayment check occurs right after we calculate what the transaction's fee should be. However the fee paid by the transaction at that time does not always match. Notably, when doing SFFO, the fee paid at that time will almost always be less than the fee required, which then required having a bypass of the underpayment check that results in SFFO payments going through when they should not.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the underpayment check to after fees have been finalized so that we always check whether the fee is being underpaid. This removes the exception for SFFO and unifies this behavior for both SFFO and non-SFFO txs.\r\n\r\nBased on #26611 for the error changes made there.",
