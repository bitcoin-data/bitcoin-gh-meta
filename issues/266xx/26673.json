   "body" : "Drop `UniValue::getBool` method because it is easy to confuse with the `UniValue::get_bool` method, and could potentially cause bugs. Unlike `get_bool`, `getBool` doesn't ensure that the value is a boolean and returns false for all integer, string, array, and object values instead of throwing an exception.\r\n\r\nThe `getBool` method is also redundant because it is an alias for `isTrue`. There were only 5 `getBool()` calls in the codebase, so this commit replaces them with `isTrue()` or `get_bool()` calls as appropriate.\r\n\r\nThese changes were originally made by MarcoFalke in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26213 but were dropped to limit the scope of that PR.",
