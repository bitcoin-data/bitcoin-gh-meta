The binaries have not been _removed_ in any case, as they are not actually downloadable from the GH release. The Github release only contains links to the same tagged source code (which is still available), and a pointer to bitcoincore.org, which is the only place that binaries are available for download.\r\n\r\nVisiting https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/ lists Bitcoin Core 23.0 for download and not 24.0. I however understand that 24.0.1 is tagged and will be available soon with its binaries, wouldn't it be good to have version 24.0 listed on Bitcoincore.org's download page if not on the Github releases? Is there a way to create a request to have release 24.0 listed there for easy download and access? \r\n\r\nThe same applies for the Blog https://bitcoincore.org/en/blog/. I am unable to currently find an entry showing an update for 24.0 'Bitcoin Core 24.0 released'. I'm not sure if this was not published or not.\r\n\r\nAfter some digging I was able to find https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-24.0/ where the Binaries are available thanks to my browsers history.
