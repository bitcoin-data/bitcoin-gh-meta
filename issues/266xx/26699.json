   "body" : "The previous behavior for `getAvailableBalance`, when the coin control had selected coins, was to return the sum of them. Instead, we are currently returning the wallet's available total balance minus the selected coins total amount.\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nMissed to update the `GetAvailableBalance` function to include the coin control selected coins on #25685.\r\n\r\nContext:\r\nSince #25685 we skip the selected coins inside `AvailableCoins`, the reason is that there is no need to waste resources walking through the entire wallet's txes map just to get coins that could have gotten by just doing a simple `mapWallet.find`).\r\n\r\nPlaces Where This Generates Issues:\r\n1) The GUI balance check prior the transaction creation process.\r\n2) The GUI \"useAvailableBalance\" functionality.\r\n\r\nNote 1:\r\nAs the GUI uses a balance cache since https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/598, this issue does not affect the regular spending process. Only arises when the user manually select coins.\r\n\r\nNote 2:\r\nAdded test coverage for the `useAvailableBalance` functionality.",
