However, it does manage to get to the redownload phase so i thought it is better then not having fuzzing at all.\r\n\r\nIt would also be nice to fuzz the p2p logic that is using `HeadersSyncState` (e.g. `TryLowWorkHeadersSync`, `IsContinuationOfLowWorkHeadersSync`) but that likely requires some more work (refactoringð»).",
