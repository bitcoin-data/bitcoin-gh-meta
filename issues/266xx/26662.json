   "body" : "This adds a fuzz target for the `HeadersSyncState` class.\r\n\r\nI am unsure how well this is able to cover the logic since it is just processing unserialized CBlockHeaders straight from the fuzz input (headers are sometimes made continuous). However, it does manage to get to the redownload phase so i thought it is better then not having fuzzing at all.\r\n\r\nIt would also be nice to fuzz the p2p logic that is using `HeadersSyncState` (e.g. `TryLowWorkHeadersSync`, `IsContinuationOfLowWorkHeadersSync`) but that likely requires some more work (refactoringð»).",
