   "body" : "- Since seed lines comes with `str` type, comparing `good` column directly with **0** (`int` type) in the if statement was not working at all. This is fixed by casting `int` type to the values in the `good` column of seeds text file.\r\n- Lines that starts with comment in the seeds text file are now ignored.\r\n- If statement for checking bad seeds are moved to the top of the `parseline` function as if a seed is bad; there is no point of going forward from there.\r\n\r\nSince this bug-fix eliminates bad seeds over **550k** in the first place, in my case; particular job for parsing all seeds speed is up by **600%** and whole script's speed is up by **%30**.\r\n\r\nNote that **stats** in the terminal are not going to include bad seeds after this fix, which would be the same if this bug were never there before.",
