Unfortunately I don't think it'll be possible for me to reproduce this, even with all the (detailed!) info you've provided, and I would be surprised if anyone can learn anything from that `dmesg` line.\r\n\r\nOn that basis I don't know whether it's worth keeping this issue open at all, as I don't see how it can be addressed. If it is closed then will still be searchable via the repo in the case that we get a second report of it.\r\n\r\nSorry not to be more help.",
