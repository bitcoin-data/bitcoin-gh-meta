   "body" : "Inspired by MarcoFalke's [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26506#discussion_r1036149426). Main purpose of this PR is to minimize copying (potentially large) RPC named arguments when calling `.substr()` by using `std::string_view` instead of `std::string`. Furthermore, cleans up the code by removing unnecessary complexity in `ParseNonRFCJSONValue()` (done first to avoid refactoring required to concatenate `string` and `string_view`), updates some naming and adds a few test cases. Should not introduce any behaviour change.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n- ~Was there actually any merit to `ParseNonRFCJSONValue()` surrounding the value with brackets and then parsing it as an array? I don't see it, and the new approach doesn't fail any tests. Still a bit suspicious about it though.~\r\n  - Cleared up by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26506#pullrequestreview-1211984059\r\n  - If there are no objections to 7727603e44f8f674e0fc8389e78047e2b56e6052, I think we should follow up with a PR to rename `ParseNonRFCJSONValue()` to a local `Parse()` helper function (that throws if invalid), remove it from `client.h` and merge the test coverage we currently have on `ParseNonRFCJSONValue()` with the coverage we have on `UniValue::read()`.",
