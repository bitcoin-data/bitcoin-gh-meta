This can be especially useful for Raspberry Pi based full nodes, which often experience power outages or similar issues which can corrupt data.\r\n\r\nIt allows full node operators to make Bitcoin Core reindex automatically, without having to worry about removing the reindex flag again. (Which isn't much effort, but can be annoying to forget).\r\n\r\nIn case this error message is printed, pretty much nothing else except a reindex can be done, so adding this feature would make user experience slightly better.\r\n\r\nRebased version of #22072.",
