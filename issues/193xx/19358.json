   "body" : "While fiddling around with torcontrol and other tor proxy settings,\r\nI noticed that the node tried to connect over the default 9050 port and ignored my settings. \r\n\r\nThat was the case when the node try's to create a default hidden ephemeral tor service at startup.\r\n\r\nSo ,when we define our own proxy settings in conf, we don't want this to be skipped\r\nby the default proxy creation that we setup while creating the\r\nephemeral hidden onion service.\r\nNote; When -torcontrol and -proxy is defined in conf, we should *not*\r\noverride this with the default settings 127.0.0.1:9050.\r\nSince the proxy ip and port might for good reasons have been set to other values.\r\n\r\nBefore this fix default settings could override conf and you could end\r\nup not to be able to connect to .onion nodes or connect over the wrong proxy.\r\n\r\nAlso fixes #14722 some years ago noticed by qubenix \r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nWhile check more options I wondered what PR  #14425 is about?\r\nAnd indeed the -onlynet flags are clearly disregarded  in respect to onions\r\nsince #7553. We could merge #14425 or adapt the tor.md doku to the actual\r\nbehavior.  Here my suggestion, with some *British* humor. :woman_shrugging:\r\nMy guess the consumption of the Catch22 movie, had influence when parts of\r\nthe option logic where implemented in the first place. \r\n \r\nedit saibato\r\nThe Tor doc change laanwj  mentioned later in review had moved to #20091 \r\nThis PR now also fixes #13378 and is replacement for the fix from wodry #14425\r\n",
