   "body" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nWhen running `make` while there are other pre-existing builds, there can be errors that don't clearly suggest using `make clean`. This step may be obvious to experienced developers, but is confusing to many bitcoin users without a background in C/Make. Currently, [`build-unix.md`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md) does not mention using `make clean`. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA simple fix would be to include a hint in the \"[To build](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md#to-build)\" section of `build-unix.md`. I'd be happy to make the change myself, but wanted to get feedback first to avoid wasting reviewers' time.\r\n\r\n**Other changes**\r\n[build-osx.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md#build-bitcoin-core) also uses `make`, as does the[ Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md#build-bitcoin-core) instructions. Those could be updated with the same note. I'm not familiar with the BSD systems, but the docs say they use `gmake`, which also appears to have a `gmake clean` option.\r\n\r\n**Related issue**\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16479\r\n",
