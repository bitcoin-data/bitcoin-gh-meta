   "body" : "`BerkeleyBatch` and `BerkeleyDatabase` are kind of messy. The goal of this is to clean up them up so that they are logically separated.\r\n\r\n`BerkeleyBatch` currently handles the creation of the `BerkeleyDatabase`'s `Db` handle. This is instead moved into `BerkeleyDatabase` and is called by `BerkeleyBatch`.\r\n\r\nInstead of having `BerkeleyEnvironment` track each database's usage, have `BerkeleyDatabase` track this usage itself with the `m_refcount` variable that is present in `WalletDatabase`.\r\n\r\nLastly, instead of having each `BerkeleyEnvironment` store the fileids of the databases open in it, have a global `g_fileids` to track those fileids. We were already checking fileid uniqueness globally (by checking the fileids in every environment when opening a database) so it's cleaner to do this with a global variable.\r\n\r\nAll of these changes allow us to make `BerkeleyBatch` and `BerkeleyDatabase` no longer be friend classes.\r\n\r\nThe diff of this PR is currently the same as in ##18971\r\n\r\nRequires #19334",
