(I am prepared to defend my argument that BDB_CFLAGS is wrong here, and BDB_CPPFLAGS is right, but this could bite anybody who has gotten in the habit of -- or scripted -- setting the former.)~~\r\n\r\nOk, I have been convinced that I was too clever with the refactor and I have removed it. Now it's just the tiny change to fix the build on my local machine.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn OS X, when searching Homebrew keg-only packages for BDB 4.8, if we find it,\r\nuse BDB_CPPFLAGS and BDB_LIBS instead of CFLAGS and LIBS for the result. This\r\nis (1) more correct, and (2) necessary in order to give this location\r\npriority over other directories in the include search path, which may include\r\nsystem include directories with other versions of BDB.\r\n",
