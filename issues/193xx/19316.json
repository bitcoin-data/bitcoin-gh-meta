   "body" : "**This is part 1 of #19315, which enables the ability to test `outbound` and `block-relay-only` connections from the functional tests.** Please see that PR for more information of overall functionality.\r\n\r\n**This PR simplifies how we manage different connection types.** It introduces an enum with the various types of connections so we can explicitly define the connection type. The existing system relies on a series of independent flags, then has asserts scattered around to ensure that conflicting flags are not enabled at the same time. I find this approach to be both brittle and confusing. While making these changes, I found a small bug due to the silent assumptions. \r\n\r\nThis PR also proposes a rename from `OneShot` to `AddrFetch`. I find the name `OneShot` to be very confusing, especially when we also have `onetry` manual connections. Everyone I've talked to offline has agreed that the name is confusing, so I propose a potential alternative. I think this is a good opportunity for a rename since I'm creating an enum to explicitly define the connection types. \r\n(some context for the unfamiliar: `oneshot` or `addrfetch` connections are short-lived connections created on startup. They connect to the seed peers, send a `getaddr` to solicit addresses, then close the connection.)\r\n\r\nOverview of this PR: \r\n* rename `oneshot` to `addrfetch`\r\n* introduce `ConnectionType` enum \r\n* one by one, add different connection types to the enum \r\n* expose the `conn_type` on CNode, and use this to reduce reliance on flags (& asserts) \r\n* fix the bug in counting different type of connections \r\n* some additional cleanup to simplify logic and make expectations explicit/inclusive rather than implicit/exclusive. \r\n",
