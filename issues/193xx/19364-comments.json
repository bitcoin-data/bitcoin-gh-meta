In effect this means that the set is emptied very quickly. Even if the peer that provided the parent (which previously would have held the object in its `orphan_work_set`), the object will very quickly be processed from `g_orphan_work_set`.\r\n\r\nThese entries can't persist for long in the set. I could refactor `ProcessOrphanTx()` to make it more obvious that we'll always empty this set quickly, but I wanted to keep the diff small for this PR. Perhaps I could do that in a follow-up.\r\n\r\nLonger term, it might make sense to consolidate all orphan logic into a module, similar to how #19184 overhauls request logic.",

It's not so much of a concern here because the size of `orphan_work_set` is limited by the size of the orphan set, and we'll always clear `orphan_work_set` very quickly.\r\n\r\nI have a branch here: https://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/tree/2020-06-global-orphans2 that refactors `ProcessOrphanTx()` and makes it very obvious that `g_orphan_work_set` is emptied very quickly. I'm not sure whether it's worth opening that as a follow-up after this is merged.",

This makes the behavior observationally equivalent (from the perspective of any single peer) to recursively processing all orphans immediately as soon as the \"missing link\" transaction is received.\r\n\r\nWith this change that is no longer the case - P2P messages from the peer that provides the missing link can and will be processed and responded to before processing the dependent orphans. I'm not sure that anything depends on that behavior, but I also can't guarantee that there isn't.\r\n\r\nI don't think code cleanup is a sufficient justification for such a fundamental P2P change.",

How were you able to satisfy yourself that that change was safe, but this one isn't? Is there a specific scenario you're thinking of here which you're worried about?\r\n\r\nI can't think of any problems this might cause. If a peer announces a tx that conflicts with an orphan and also provides the parent, then in master, the orphan will be accepted into the mempool, but in this branch the conflicting tx may be accepted first. I don't think that's an issue since in the case of two conflicting txs we never guarantee which one will make it into the mempool. Are there other scenarios we should be considering?\r\n\r\nGenerally, if we're worried about behaviour changes we try to reason about them and satisfy ourselves that they're safe, and include tests if we have any doubts. I don't see why this PR should be different.",

      "body" : "This PR intended to do two things:\r\n\r\n1. Don't do orphan reconsideration in the context of an individual peer\r\n2. Move orphan_work_set data from net into net_processing.\r\n\r\nI think both changes are good. If everyone agreed, I don't think it'd be a problem to do both in this PR, but since this is controversial and @sipa has concerns that (1) is correct, it makes sense to split them out and consider them separately.\r\n\r\nThe branch at https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commits/202007_orphan_work_set_to_np seems fine, but I hope we'll soon have a `PeerState` struct in net_processing that isn't guarded by cs_main. That'd be a more natural place for this. See https://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/tree/2020-06-cs-main-split for a demonstration. No harm in moving it to `CNodeState` first, but it might be duplicate work if we're going to move it again shortly afterwards.",
