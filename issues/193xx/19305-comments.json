In other words, happy to wait for 0.22. Regardless, I look forward to the 0.21.0 branch-off.\r\n\r\n> Bump Qt from 5.9.x (no c++17 mode) to, likely, 5.15.x (LTS)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately QT retroactively dropped LTS for 5.15 (see #18580), i.e. it's commercial support only. But as @MarcoFalke pointed out:\r\n\r\n> I don't think we have a choice. Now that they dropped LTS, all we can do is follow their latest open source release\r\n\r\nIt's certainly doesn't seem like a reason to stick to a c++11 version of QT, since those aren't maintained at all, making it mostly an orthogonal concern.",
