Even if a settings file is truncated to size 0 and the old settings are completely lost (as opposed to partially corrupted), I still think the safest thing for `bitcoind` to do is refuse to start until the corrupt file is cleared away. It would unsafe to assume no important settings were saved before the corruption happened and just start anyway, because there could have been critical settings affecting security (sandbox settings) or privacy (tor settings, wallet settings) or performance (pruning, coins cache size) that would be important not to ignore before starting. So I don't think it would be good to treat a size 0 settings.json file differently than any other corrupt settings.json file.\r\n\r\nI also don't know of a way of avoiding corruption when writing to a full disk that would work better then the current approach of renaming a new file over the old one. Maybe bitcoin should generally shutdown or avoid writing things if disk space gets too low, though.\r\n\r\nI think since `bitcoind` is non-interactive, the best thing it can do on startup when settings are corrupt is show an error about the corruption, and exit like it is currently doing. Since `bitcoin-qt` is interactive, I think the change in bitcoin-core/gui#379 adding a dialog button to reset settings provides a decent way to recover there, and resolves this issue as well as we can for now\r\n\r\n![new-read-error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7133040/124977636-b669b400-dffe-11eb-8d35-02eda95f48c0.png)\r\n",
