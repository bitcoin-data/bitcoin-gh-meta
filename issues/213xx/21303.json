Then I opened it up on Feb 4th and it would not sync up.  Now everyday it still won't load and the progress percentage just keeps falling behind.  I've tried to delete and redownload but it just picks up where it left off the previous time.  Attached it a screenshot of the issue.  I am curious if I'm not deleting it properly? I cannot seem to get it completely deleted off the Mac hard drive?  Am help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. \r\n<img width=\"1434\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-02-26 at 10 44 04 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77411692/109321775-8c69df00-781f-11eb-9334-29a7728daa37.png\">\r\n",
