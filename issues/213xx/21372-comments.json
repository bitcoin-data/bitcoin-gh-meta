For sufficiently long-running nodes, in practice this is very often the case. As soon as there is at least one transaction missing, a roundtrip is needed which effectively triples the block relay time on each hop (CMPCTBLOCK-GETBLOCKTXN-BLOCKTXN instead of just CMPCTBLOCK).\r\n\r\nSo generally, adding transactions to your own blocks without even (trying to) relay them to the network is a bad idea for the network, and for the miner personally, as they have an incentive to get their blocks propagated as swiftly as possible to other miners.",
