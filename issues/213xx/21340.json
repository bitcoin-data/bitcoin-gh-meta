The solution was obvious in retrospect: delete it. But not everyone is going to figure this out by themselves.\r\n\r\nShould this error be fatal at all? Could it be ignored and logged? Or is a warning then deleting it better (at least in the GUI, that's harder to do for the daemon).\r\n\r\nAnother thing to look into might be to write the file atomically so that this doesn't occur.",
