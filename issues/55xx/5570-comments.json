It may look a little weird with just one, but that has always been the case.\n- \"Transaction fee\"-dialog squeezes \"pay to\"-dialog (screenshot 2)\n\nRight, the main window should be resized to compensate for the additional UI elements shown. Too bad this doesn't happen automatically. (@laanwj Any ideas for this?)\n- More intuitive order of dialogs would be pay to - coin control - transaction fee\n\nI agree on this one here ;).\n",
