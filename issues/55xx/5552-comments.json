      "body" : "Thats expected, but I also thought that this will probably confuse people.\nThe thing is that the priority calucation is based on the slider, because\nin order to get a fast free-transaction, you need a higher priority than to\nget a normal-fast-free-transaction. And the priority label getting red means\n\"You cant get a free transaction for the confirmation target you selected with the slider\".\n\nBut maybe we should change this. So that the priority calucation is always based on confirmation\ntarget of 25 (as if slider=normal). But the label becoming red could be based on the target, so that\nyou still know from the color, whether or not a free transaction is possible.\n",
