So this argument doesn't really go either way. I'm pretty sure its easy to set up the Travis CI to do this automatically for you.\n\nIn the cherry-pick strategy I have seen many projects (opensource or at my work) run into problems. For instance because its hard to keep track of which things are backported already. You can forget commits that need to be on the stable branch. There is also no way to mark a bugfix as \"meant for stable\" in the pull request.\n\nNext to that a cherry-pick is a manual operation that can introduce errors and, worse, it allows for tampering. A 2 line fix is easy to proof-read, but a larger bugfix can easily be changed and end up with an exploit in the release branch.  The original submitter would never find out.\n\nWhich comes back to signing your commits; as Bitcoin grows the need to be certain about code origin grows. Now you made two commits in my name where you were able to change anything if you wanted to. Which essentially means there is no trust model. Well, we have to trust you :)\n\nSigning a commit would be much better trust model, and I would argue that bitcoin core will grow in importance (accountability wise) faster than the Linux kernel did. Which does have a signing policy as you know.\n\nAll I wrote here is the more verbose version of explaining why cherry-pick is not something you should do, you can probably find many more if you go to the kernel ML or other big open source projects.\n\n> In the cherry-picked commit a back-reference is made to the original commit(s) and pull requests, so this doesn't prevent auditing of any kind.\n\nAs explained above; there is no way to do automatic auditing because you manually committed those changes. There is no guarantee it is even the same patch, and it doesn't have to be. You even changed the commit message so any hash-based checking is impossible too.\nAll you can do is manually compare the two commits in the two branches to see if they are mostly the same.\n",
