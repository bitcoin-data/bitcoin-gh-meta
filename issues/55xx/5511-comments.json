This depends on whether other nodes received the transactions (and ultimately the miners).\r\n\r\nThere is also a chance that other nodes received the unconfirmed transactions, but your local client doesn't know anything about them after zapping, so please wait some time, ideally a few blocks, until you resend the transactions, which didn't go through.",
