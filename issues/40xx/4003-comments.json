      "body" : "The first time I noticed the error was shortly after using rsync to copy my whole home directory over to a new laptop.  The one I was copying from was running bitcoin-qt at the time.  I figured that was a bad idea, so went to shut bitcoin-qt down and re-run the sync, and it was then that I saw the error message.  I was wondering if the problem could have been caused by rsync reading the wallet file while it was open.  But as I say, the laptop had frozen on resume shortly before this as well.\n\nI restarted bitcoin, it came up just fine, but again when I went to shut it down, I saw the same error again.\n\nAnd interestingly, even after copying everything over to the new laptop, I saw the same error on the new laptop the first time I ran it.  But just this morning I was able to shut it down without the error, so it looks like the problem eventually resolved itself.\n\nHere's a screenshot I took the first time the error happened.  Both dialogs are on the screen at the same time.\n\n![screenshot - 14-04-04 - 07 15 45 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/573356/2623414/1089aaea-bced-11e3-8d11-40d46c9de99b.png)\n\nI should probably mention that I'm using libdb5.3++-dev and had to use a ./configure flag for non-compatible wallets, but I've been using that for a long time.\n\nRunning the dump/load commands completes without error (on the new laptop where the problem is already apparently fixed), and makes the wallet considerably smaller:\n\n```\n$ cp ~/.bitcoin/wallet.dat wallet.dat.before\n$ db5.3_dump wallet.dat.before | db5.3_load wallet.dat.after\n$ ls -lh wallet.dat*\n-rw-r--r-- 1 chris chris 140M Apr  5 11:11 wallet.dat.after\n-rw------- 1 chris chris 151M Apr  5 11:10 wallet.dat.before\n$ \n```\n\nI'll try it on the old laptop where the error presumably still happens.\n",
