I'm pretty sure that some people will click it.\n\nThe larger problem is how to divide the money, and who does it. I don't believe bounties per commit have much usefulness beyond sparking people's initial interest. It also gives a distorted incentive.\n",

      "body" : "@laanwj You had mentioned in the about dialog, although I am interested if this could be made more dynamic than something that would appear in that dialog.  I've been very interested lately in the concept of options that can be more easily generated by users or groups of users, such as the [concepts shown here](https://github.com/spesmilo/sx/tree/master/tools) in what is described as the charity donations section.  I see this as less of a 'charity donations' concept and more of a way in which there would be more flexibility afforded to the user.  @gmaxwell mentioned that one possibility could be a feature that would process small change and tiny txouts to user specified donation targets, my thinking here is that there could be a process where this is incentivized.  Those who are running full nodes (running Bitcoin Core all the time) and are processing their change and txouts through Core are provided incentives (potentially, mining / pools could have lottery established such that all participants who are running nodes and donating no matter how infrequently will be entered in a lottery, the amounts would vary from small to large btc amounts depending).  I know that the lottery concept is frequently raised, but I feel it would help incentivize both the issue of declining nodes as well as encouraging giving and microdonations.  This ties in directly to this open issue because at the same time the option could still be provided in the transactions area to contribute to help bitcoin core development for those that are setting up change and txouts for donations.  edit: Not sure if lottery concept is supportable or not after reading [this](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/253), but maybe?\nanother edit: Thinking about how much time / energy people devote to running a node and how is that determined and rewarded? (example of [analysis relating to Tor](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7r4osQgWVqKTHdxTlowUVpsVmJRcjF3Y3dtcTVscFhEaW5F/view?sle=true))\nFinal edit to this comment:  It occurred to me that there could be some confusion between this lottery idea and other reward concepts already in use, including block reward.  To clarify any confusion, I want to add that the lottery would occur in addition to existing block reward processes.\nThoughts on this?\n",

      "body" : "The basic question is how bitcoin core developers (or any other group) can get a stake in the money flow.  I am unable to separate this issue from micropayments conceptually.  It occurs to me then that many other situations are not so different.  \n\nExample, we need a road from point A to B.  So we create a government structure to force people to give it money which we then spend on the road.  Over time (hopefully) everyone benefits.  Why was this method in place?  Because micropayments were did not exist - if they had, history of road building might be completely different.  But now we have the rudiments of micropayments using bitcoin as the backbone.  NOT well developed, implemented and spread to the diverse user communities, though.\n\nIf micropayments were well understood and embedded in practice, to the level that they were actionable on mobile devices that most people owned, would this matter be solvable in that context?  Would the matter exist as a subject of discussion and / or development, and how would it be phrased?  I say this because I am wondering if we ask the right question at the wrong time, such as asking \"how to get to the moon\", when the highest velocity chemical rocket was gunpowder.  Right question, wrong time.\n",

I tend to like the WhisperSystems / Bithub model (linked in issue description) precisely because it allows for opt in / out and for those who opt in, provides them with a certain amount based on commit. One of the things that I think (on the microdonations side) that this concept would need, is the development and circulation of a Process BIP (specific kind of bitcoin improvement proposal).  On the one hand there is the incorporation into wallet technology and in the case of this issue the emphasis is on Bitcoin Core, but a Process BIP would also help.  There are elements of this open issue that could conceivably be implemented by developers quickly (examples being the parts that involve ways to help fund activities of developers) without any further study.  However, there are various aspects of this which are complex, all of which could be handled by wallet technology (in many wallet types), but which for the purposes of incentivizing the running of full node (Bitcoin Core) and addressing the substance of this open issue, appear to need a lengthy review through bitcoin development processes so as to flesh out a process and path forward.  Rather than an issue of 'wrong time,' the issue is timely, but simply requires further review and comment.\n",

I'd rather it remained open, due to that I'd like to get more discussion going on the issue (as modified, see description) from bitcoin development list and other sources.  I also don't concur that the concepts presented are too abstract to take action on. In fact @gmaxwell and @laanwj have added thoughts in comments that have made me consider that some of the concepts may be actionable more quickly (such as how to provide option for donation to bitcoin development) whereas other concepts would require more in-depth level of review.  Essentially for these reasons, I'd like this to remain open.  Either way, I will continue to advance these concepts and suggest them through bitcoin development list and such processes that would enable additional community discussion, development focused commentary, and so forth.

For example, here's the one I'm working on:\n\nhttp://blog.vinumeris.com/2014/05/17/lighthouse/\n\nIn the past we've found that donations and bounties don't work well. Donations raise very little money. Bounties don't attract quality work due to the winner-takes-all setup they use. I'm hoping assurance contracts will be different, but we'll have to try it to find out.\n\nW.R.T. micropayments for full nodes, that's a large and complex project that I doubt anyone working on Core will have the time for anytime soon. Also, right now there are lots of people giving away node services for free, so the cost would be zero. And we hardly want fees to go even higher than they are: bitcoin transactions are already absurdly expensive relative to their actual cost due to a broken fees market. So although Matt and I partly implemented micropayment channels in bitcoinj with this use case in mind, it's going to be a long time before that's really needed IMHO.\n",

      "body" : "@mikehearn Thanks for elaborating on this. I've been watching with interest the announcement(s) related to lighthouse.  Those are great ideas.  The micropayment, peer to peer and smart property elements are bleeding edge stuff... I'm guessing you have poked around the openbazaar repository at https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar (incredible stuff by @drwasho and others), there are things about the lighthouse and the openbazaar that are very similar, maybe some collaboration betweent the two possible?\n\nBut back to this issue, I agree that the micropayment / incentive system described to incentivize more people to run full nodes is indeed large and complex and I appreciate you taking the time to note that it would likely be a long time before this sort of notion would be given much development attention (and fees are an issue too as you noted)  I've thrown it over to the bitcoin development mailing list, and every so often will nudge it gently with a little stick.  I won't give up on this sort of concept eventually gaining traction in some form or another and I hope that it inspires other, related solutions.  Meanwhile, back to the wallet side ~ [http://abis.io](http://abis.io) project, where my attentions are really focused.\nIncentivizing giving and providing options for doing so is vital ~ our notions of what transactions are need to change, our vision of a financial future should gear towards a framework in which giving is a natural and uninhibited part of everything.\n",
