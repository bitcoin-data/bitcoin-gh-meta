But I think that one is pretty self-explanatory.\n\nAs for the c++ ones, they have a specific purpose, just that the definitions were moved from the header to the binary implementation. I think it's safe to say that the purpose of those functions won't change. The only danger I can imagine is that they could (for example) change the side-effects of an internal function that we call.\n\nFor example, imagine that we need to implement list::insert. We call some of their internal methods like operator[] and iterator++, then we change some internal variables. It's possible that in the future, they could change those variables in the internal functions, so that we've actually changed them twice.\n\nBut I don't think that's a very reasonable concern. If you look at what's actually implemented, you'll see that it's so low-level that there's really only one way to handle the function.\n\nAnyway, let's enumerate here so we can narrow down the concern:\n\n__fdelt_warn: Checks for overflows in FD_ functions. This can be hit (read: this forces a crash) on:\n\n```\nfd_set rfds;\nFD_ZERO(&rfds);\nFD_SET(FD_SETSIZE+1, &rfds); //BOOM!\n```\n\nI initially had a unit-test for this, but the problem is that we actually _want_ it to crash, and boost tests don't play nice with the idea of a program abort being a passing test. Plus, it spews a really nasty backtrace.\n\nbad_alloc/bad_cast/bad_exception:\nThese are cosmetic, used for debugging or logging. If they end up displaying new messages in the future, that's no problem. Anything comparing these strings would be horribly broken already.\n\n_List_node_base:\nThese are related to list->insert or so. They were broken out of the headers and moved into the binary implementation, I believe as part of the c++11 split. These were taken as obvious from upstream, and it's hard to imagine that their meanings could change.\n\nostream/istream templates: These just force on new templates that are declared 'extern template' in the headers. Seems strange that those worked without c++11 anway. gnu extension, i guess?\n\nout_of_range: This one I'll admit I don't know much about.\nI found that another project received permission to copy glibc's implementation verbatim, so I did the same.\n\nIf there's any interest in seeing what pulls in a symbol, you can trace it at link-time using -Wl,--trace-symbol.\n\nAlso, as to the concern about accidentally introducing new symbols, it would be very easy to teach pull-tester to check for that. Though, obviously, it'd need to be using the same libc/libstdc++ as the release compiler.\n",

For example, _M_unhook() is called by _M_erase(). If _M_erase were present in the libstdc++ shared lib, it would call whichever unhook implementation was hard-coded into it. But, as far as I can see, all of our replaced functions are used by inlined callers, so the effect is that it always will use our stubs.\n\nYou do seem to have a misconception about how our code uses these stubs, though. Keep in mind that we don't include definitions for these functions. \"Our\" code never sees them or has any idea  that they exist. We just ends up getting routed to them from inside of libstdc++ at runtime.\n",

If bitcoind starts up successfully and runs for a few seconds, I don't believe any problems would be likely to surface afterward.\n\nIf anyone is uncomfortable with that response, I can look into adding some tests, but they're low level enough that the tests would be something like:\n\n```\nstd::list<int> foo, bar;\nfoo.push_back(1); foo.push_back(2); foo.pop_back();\nbar.push_back(1); bar.push_back(2); bar.pop_back();\nassert(foo == bar);\n```\n\nPoint being that if that failed, it'd be pretty obvious even without the test.\n\nEssentially, we just need to decide if this is the favored approach, and if so, set some sort of policy to deal with changes in the future.\n",

The example above wasn't abstract, that would be the actual test-case for list_node.\n\nAs for _M_widen_init(), this is all it takes is this to bring it in:\n\n``` c++\n#include <iostream>\nint main()\n{\n  for(int i=0; i != 2; i++)\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n}\n```\n\nYou can verify that by doing a quick compile and grep:\n\n``` bash\ncory@cory-i7:~/dev/bitcoin/src(libc-compat)$ g++ test.cpp -O1 -o test && objdump -TC test | grep _M_widen_init\n0000000000000000      DF *UND*  0000000000000000  GLIBCXX_3.4.11 std::ctype<char>::_M_widen_init() const\n```\n\nSo cout (among many other things) would be broken with a borked version of that function. I'm not sure there's really anything to test for that wouldn't be 100% obvious in the resulting binary.\n\nI'm not trying to be difficult on this, I hope it doesn't seem that way. But since we've lifted the definitions of these from upstream, it really does seem (to me, anyway) to be all or nothing.\n\nAny suggestions for alternate tests, or alternative ways of testing?\n",
