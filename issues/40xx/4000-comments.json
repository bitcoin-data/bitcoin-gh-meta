That probability is strictly greated than a block hash collision (because \"all hashes ever\" is a superset of \"all hashes used in blocks\").\n\nUsing the well known approximation we can [get how many hashes to generate before to get a one percent chance of a collision](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F100+%3D+1-e**%28%28-k*%28k-1%29%29%2F%282*%282**256%29%29%29). Works out to about 2**125 (rounding down).\n\nHow many hashes is 2**125? A double hash (like used in bitcoin) requires 3375 integer operations, and each word has 32 bits, so approximately 108000 \\* 2**125 bit flips. At the maximum achievable efficiency possible at room temperature, computing that many bit flips requires [a third of the world's fossil fuel reserves](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=108000+*+2**125+*+0.0178+eV) to be burned just to compute them. And that's at a theoretical optimum efficiency. Use realistic figures and you'll get 10,000 times that energy cost.\n\nLong before any of this is even remotely likely, we'll have to deal with SHA2 being broken the old-fashionned way, [by mathematicians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Cryptanalysis_and_validation).\n",
