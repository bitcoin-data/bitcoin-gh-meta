   "body" : "For 0.9 we want to avoid the situation from 0.8 where it was impossible to get updated translations into latter 0.8 versions. The reason that this was no longer possible is that the messages that changed in master relative to 0.8 were (automatically) removed from the translation files.\n\nFor this reason I would like to change the translation process a bit. \n\nThe first step would be to create a script to combine `master` and `0.9` English translation files (`bitcoin_en.ts`). This script would add messages from both, and merge duplicate messages intelligently [1]. This avoids that the 0.9 variants of messages get pruned.\n\nThe result of this script would then be committed either to master or a new branch created specifically for Transifex to fetch from. The overall effect will be that translators can translate messages from both branches with minimal overhead.\n\nThe resulting translations can then be imported and used for both future 0.9 releases and during development of master.\n\nGeneral guidelines:\n- Try to keep as much as possible consistency between `0.9` and `master` mesages.\n  - This means: message changes (for typos or clarification) should be merged into both 0.9 and 0.10.\n  - Some message changes cannot be merged into both branches because they accompany functionality changes. This is fine.\n\n[1] For example, merge messages that are exactly the same and that appear in the same file.\n",
