The protocol already has features such as multisig that can help here.\n\nIn general, github is not for vague proposals for bitcoin, but for concrete changes to the implementation \"Bitcoin Core\". Hence I suggest moving this elsewhere, like the forums. But first do a thorough Google search - as said, this has been discussed many times.\n",

By directly returning the coins to mining miners are incentivized to refuse to mine near-expiration transactions in the hopes that they won't make it in in-time and will expireÃ¢ÂÂ \"near\" doesn't have a bright line distinction, it's just whatever they can get away with. As a result I don't think this proposal would be very advisable in any crypto-currency, not just Bitcoin.\n\nOne problem with the \"market will just price the loss in\" is that the market currently can't distinguish loss from just inactivity, so that creates growing uncertainty about the supply. This could be answered by the simpler approach of just making long unmoved coins unmovable, which has less incentive problemsÃ¢ÂÂ though it's still probably completely Bitcoin incompatible.\n",

You have an OP_IF and in the branch you have a timelock verify and a different set of keys to sign for the coin. Though its a bit inefficient to always have to sign including that data.\n\nAnother alternative for 'inheritance keys' is to simply always create timelocked spends of your coins whenever you receive them. I've thought this might be an interesting wallet feature, to automatically create timelocked spends of your coin so that if you don't spend them by a certain time they'll go to selected friends/family/charities. (Friends/family having an advantage that perhaps they can give them back to you if you're still around and merely lost your wallet).\n",

      "body" : "I am not a Coder, but a committed investor and Trader in crypto currencies, mainly as a hedge against other investments - since Bitcoin parity with gold in February / March 2017. I have no loyalty to any main Holder of Value coin, or Altcoin, But would like to see BTC become the main Holder of Value which it deserves to be, because of its White Paper (motives of Satoshi Nakamoto holding a lot of Bitcoin are not explicitly considered here).\r\n\r\nI think @AndyCapeTown raises an incredibly important issue which is critical to mainstream adoption for a Holder of Value crypto. I imagine it is relatively easy for a fork of Bitcoin, to ensure full Monetary Supply control, via the recycling of dead wallets. A fork that does this may be the prerequisite for all Blockchains in the future. I think BTC is vulnerable to being \"outforked\". We have the technology to have full Monetary Supply control, it seems crazy not to use it.\r\n\r\nI am not factoring general improvements of usability through cold storage wallets, or other USPs such as fully private blockchains, which also could make BTC vulnerable to a more competitive Holder of Value. \r\n\r\nBenefits of Dead Wallet Recycling:\r\na) 2 year lag on unverified wallets - Monetary Supply will be assured \r\n(physically accessing a wallet could be enough to ping verification within 2 years of first balance?)\r\n\r\nb) Estate Management workarounds have to be arranged by Crypto Holders in the event of death\r\n(Could a decentralised register of Births and Deaths be used so that a SMART contract triggers the \r\nmovement of wallet funds as per Will Instructions?)\r\n\r\nc) Recycling of dead wallets could be an economic tool to fairly redistribute wealth to all individuals\r\n(there is a lot of evidence that the 1% (fraction of the 1%?) are just getting richer in real terms since the high mark of Social Mobility in the 1970s in the UK at least, and neo liberal economics of the 1980s which have just increased \"Rent Seeking\" in multiple markets, which distributed ledgers can correct to 0-1% - the current legacy system is biased, see certified Cognitive Biases on Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)\r\n\r\nd i) Pre Mined Fork with 90% of satoshis could be allocated to all individuals fairly\r\n(A United Nations Coin, UN Coin, could fork off Bitcoin and do this?)\r\nd ii) Immense Market Accumulation by Whales would be prevented \r\n(early BTC adopter wealth may not be tolerated by the majority that are not in Crypto)\r\n\r\nf) Geopolitical stability assured through decentralised global finance management era \r\n(immense financial volatility as legacy system and debt needs to be accounted in decentralised alternatives[would it be written off?], if Cryptos go past 50% of total Money Supply on an S-Curve. This implies that there will only be 1 Holder of Value that succeeds? The problem of Quantitative Easing / Printing Money by Central Banks and becoming Whales in Crypto needs considering).\r\n\r\nWell done to Andrew van der Nest for raising such a critical point so many years ago, it is sad to see it being dismissed as a Forum discussion. Perhaps the Bitcoin Developers need to employ economists to advise them? I would not be surprised if the Main Holder of Value mantle moves to another coin via outforking BTC.\r\n\r\nIn terms of usability of Crypto, I think there are a few more iterations needed for hardware wallets until they are ready for main stream adoption - too many software updates at the moment, and some are almost unusable.\r\n\r\nThe problem of theft / hostaging holders needs some thought regarding securing funds, point d) above would remove this as an issue.",
