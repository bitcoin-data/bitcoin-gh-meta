I tried putting this statement inside `EnsureWalletIsUnlocked();`, but that would complicate the API considerably since the caller would have to receive the lock object and then make sure to unlock it appropriately afterwards.\n\nI also refactored `walletlock` to simply call `LockWallet()` since this looked like duplicate code to me (well, two lines are swapped in order, but that shouldn't matter).\n\nThe changes are here, but I have not been able to get `make check` to work, so I'm still looking into that.\n\n https://github.com/MattFaus/bitcoin/commits/wallet_lock2\n",
