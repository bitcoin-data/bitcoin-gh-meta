I'm not sure about this though - balance is computed in multiple ways.\n\nto which laanwj [responded](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3654#issuecomment-34812183):\n\n> Agreed. I think if the wallet is fixed to remove/hide duplicated (due to malleability) unconfirmed transactions, the balance will be fixed too, and we don't need to do anything else.\n\nRegardless of how altered transactions should be handled, I think it's important _never_ to try to hide reality.\n\nJust show the user _both_ the confirmed and unconfirmed balances, particularly when they differ (and particularly when unconfirmed change has been set to be treated as truly unconfirmed).\n",

But since you keep repeating it...   Part of the entire purpose of the software's front end is to make the software usable to humans by taking care of and reducing the visibility of complicated details which would over load the user.  It is essential that the software abstract away all sorts of details in order to make it comprehensible at all.  A totally non-hidden interface would be something like listunspent and wouldn't even present a balanceâ a balance is a fiction, coins are not really fungibleâ.  In any case, you run into problems when you've chosen the wrong abstractions or provided an incomplete set of them.\n\nWhat the balance is showing is coins the software believes it can safely spend. It is \"intuitively obvious\" that your own change is safe to spent, except the intuition is made incorrect by the fact that malleability can invalidate the children of a mutated transaction.  The software does, however, only spend them as a last resort when the only other option would be to reject the transaction.\n",

If you don't use terms that a user finds familiar, there's nothing to base the interaction metaphor on. To that end we use \"wallet\" as it's a concept the user finds familiar, you put coins in your wallet and that makes a reasonable amount of sense without explanation. The term \"keyring\" makes sense with something like GPG/PGP where the user is actively managing private and public keys themselves, but Bitcoin operates a layer above this where we attempt to completely hide the fact that public/private keys even exist to the non-technical user. \n\nThe fact that we have people messing with importing and exporting keypairs shows that we just haven't enforced the wallet abstraction enough. People using blockchain.info as a source of information is extremely unfortunate in this regard, I would personally have preferred much of this to have stayed hidden as much as possible from the eyes of the general user. Blockchain.info unfortunately enforces the notion that \"address\" == \"wallet\", which is incorrect and undesirable in many ways.\n\nThis is of course completely off topic as far as this PR goes.\n",

Why when a user makes a transaction does all or some of the funds in a vault disappear and move to one that's completely unrelated? If we are to avoid explaining inputs and change addresses to people, we've got to be higher leveled than that. Presently we have a \"wallet\" which stores funds, which has an unlimited number of \"receiving addresses\" (note, never \"sending address\", they don't exist), and that's pretty much it. \n\nWith Bitcoin don't need to have levels of abstraction for the whole network's infinitesimal details.  Private keys, keypairs, change addresses; it's just information overload for all of these to be visible when a typical user has absolutely no need to know that they exist. We certainly shouldn't be encouraging users to ever come in contact with private keys, so it's best to just avoid them in the interface layer entirely. I believe @sipa (or somebody else) made a comment late last year that the `importprivkey` command should be entirely removed with a similar reasoning.\n\nIt's more difficult to explain blocks and confirmations without dipping into the technical side of things, but we must be able to in order to have semi-coherent, semi-usable software outside of those who have developed with it or who want to have a detailed understanding. \n",

Tell them that the bank's transaction slips don't have a spot to fill in for how much to take out when spending a vault box's contents.  You have to empty the whole thing, so any change goes to another box.  Your wallet software actually makes a change box for you, amazingly, without any cooperation from the bank, until the bank processes the transaction.  The vault boxes also have deposit slots, so anyone can add to their balance without the key.\n\nI just think maybe this isn't complex enough to justify telling users something else.  Something false.\n",
