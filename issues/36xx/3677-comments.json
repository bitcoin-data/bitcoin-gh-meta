This would cause all kinds of confusion.\n\nI would always create a new transaction that tries to use the same inputs than the old one.\nIf parent is conflicted try to use the parent variants. There could be a chain of \nunconfirmed transactions. So the parent is not always conflicted. Maybe some grand-grand-parent.\nIf not enough Inputs randomly choose other inputs. Then the old transaction is marked as \"reissued\", this field contains the hash of the new one. The GUI could hide the old invalid transaction. So the user wouldnt notice. We could also hide them in RPC Listtransaction.\nThe rpc call reissue returns the hash of the new transaction.\n\nAlso I think we should check \"How many confirmations has the parent variant?\".\nOr the parent-parent-variant if a chain of transactions.\nOnly if >= 6 confirmations we create a new similar transaction. Otherwise we return some errorcode.\n",
