Nevertheless I would like to ask you to consider following question:\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that if a miner uses a particular coinbase address then already this address is offsetting the computation to a whole different set of resultsâ¦ Can someone, mathematically speaking, gain anything from watching what others compute given that every pool or solo-miner is computing in their own interest, their own corner of computation universe?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nPS: Just stumbled upon this issue while looking for something else.
