I wouldnt expect it there either, but it works for me.\n\nIn the addressbookpage.cpp, we have set ResizeToContents on the last column, to ensure its contents are always visible. I think this might be a good idea for the new receive-tab and also the transactions-tab too. So unless there is any other very important reason, why someone would want to resize the last column, I would rather say we consider this as an upstream qt problem.\n",

You can now grab in between the last two columns an resize from there. It responds also to window resizing, etc. \n\nIf you build this branch you'll see that it works flawlessly now, as you'd expect.\n\nI also thought of ResizeToContents but that would've been too easy (and wouldn't reflect what the user might want, perhaps they want that last column really big for some reason)\n\nI want to do it for the transactions tab as well and see if there's a pattern I can abstract, so I can then refactor from an abstraction of either QTableWidget or QHeaderView that we can reuse everywhere.\n",

It is possible but I don't know by heart.\n\nIdeally, you do `git pull --rebase` or `git rebase upstream/master` instead of merges while working on a feature branch so that you don't get merges.\n\nBut it's too late for that now :) \n\nWhat you could do is create one commit from the diff between your feature branch and the last master branch that you merged.\n\n```\n# create a new branch to do this in, based on this one\ngit checkout QT-issue-2862-last-coumn-cannot-be-resized\ngit checkout -b new_feature_branch\n# reset HEAD to last merged version of master\ngit reset --soft b19bcb7\n# make one commit with all the changes\ngit commit\n# push it to github on this issue\ngit push origin new_feature_branch:QT-issue-2862-last-coumn-cannot-be-resized\n```\n\nThis is basically a sledge-hammer approach but it should work. And you keep your old branch as `QT-issue-2862-last-coumn-cannot-be-resized` locally in case it goes wrong.\n\nAfter this you could rebase to the new master. Don't do any merges :)\n",
