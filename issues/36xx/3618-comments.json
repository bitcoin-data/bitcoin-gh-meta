It also made the whole (Bitcoin) program very slow at times of high resource contention. (although that might be better if only one thread was running at low IO priority). I don't think this feature was designed with programs with constant IO in mind, it turns off read ahead (and does various other things) so it can stop HD reading at a moment's notice and not impact other programs. I witnessed significant blocking (in the programming sense) when syncing the block chain, the TCP window was almost always full while downloading slowly. Back to normal IO (relaunch) -- 50x faster.\n\nBut for a high IO program like Bitcoin low IO priority makes the HD thrash like crazy. It didn't make the _computer_ slower than bitcoin with normal IO even with all that thrashing (IO priority works great. [Thanks Win7!]). I don't think this is a good idea to use for bitcoin.\n",

Others don't care about sync speed and rather have it slow in the background.\n\nWe have been _avoiding_ those kind of automatic settings on other platforms like Mac (app nap). In which case people complain about it slowing down bitcoin sync.\n\nThere is already a setting to make bitcoin use fewer cores: -par=, or in the 0.9 GUI \"Number of script validation threads\". If you set that to 1, for example, it will only use one thread instead of the default, one per core.\n\nSure there may be reasons to change the IO priority instead, but I also don't think this should happen automatically.\n",

But by default it creates a thread for every core, which during initial sync will have a high load (if you have a fast sync node / bootstrap) so understandably can hold up other processes. Scaling down the number of threads is the most straightforward way to avoid this.\n",
