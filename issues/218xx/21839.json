   "body" : "#19260 was merged, which now causes older nodes to not receive TXs when they ask for them. the feefilter message was established as a way for nodes to request TXs after IBD. It was not only used for bloom filters.\r\n\r\nThere's no benefit in having it disabled, and it breaks things by disabling it as it risks older nodes not receiving TXs from newer nodes.\r\n\r\nIt was claimed in #19260 that feefilters are a better way to block TXs from being sent, but this seem to go on the assumption that all nodes are running the feefilter logic, which old nodes would not be.\r\n\r\nSo perhaps this raises the question - should we be forcing people to update their node software, or should we be trying to ensure that older nodes are respected?",
