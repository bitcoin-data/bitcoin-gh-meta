Most likely due to the pre-compiled Qt binaries that are used.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem worth the effort to try and support VS2017, which would most likely require additional Qt binaries, or lengthy instructions on how to build static Qt binaries on Windows (which is very error prone and tedious).\r\n",
