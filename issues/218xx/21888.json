   "body" : "As noticed in #21135, `main` in our macOS and Windows `test_bitcoin` binaries doesn't contain control flow instrumentation. This is because `main` for those binaries is provided by Boost, and when we compile Boost in depends, we don't build with `-fcf-protection=full`, like we do [in configure](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5925f1e652768a9502831b9ccf78d16cf3c37d29/configure.ac#L883). The reason the Linux `test_bitcoin` binaries contain instrumentation is because the GCC used to build them is patched by Ubuntu to enable `-fcf-protection=full` by default.\r\n\r\nFixing this isn't as simple as building Boost in depends with `-fcf-protection=full`, because we still support compilers that don't support that option, and we don't currently have a way to test-before-using in depends. However, given that this only affects `test_bitcoin`, and only macOS and Windows, we can probably just do the following:\r\n\r\nFor macOS, we can actually just build Boost with `-fcf-protection=full`, as our cross-compiler (LLVM Clang 10) supports this option, and any Apple Clang we'd expected to be used for building depends should also support it.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, the `x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++` in Bionic in based off GCC 7.3.0, and therefore doesn't support `-fcf-protection` (introduced in GCC 8). Given we'd expect users to be cross-compiling for Windows on Bionic for a while longer yet, we can just implement the control flow checks, but skip it for test_bitcoin.\r\n\r\nFor Linux, we don't need to do anything build wise, just add the instrumentation checks. I would probably prefer to do this when we are using LIEF for Linux.",
