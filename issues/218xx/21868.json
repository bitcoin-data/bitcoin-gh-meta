   "body" : "Do you have experience recovering private keys corresponding to an address in the keypool of a corrupted Dogecoin wallet.dat from end 2013 (non-HD). There is a change address which I cannot generate after the Client tried to salvage the wallet. \n\nBalance is visibile on the blockchain which was found by dumping the database using pywallet.py but without success finding the corresponding private key. Then used tool provided by BerkeleyDB db_dump with less aggressive salvage to dump the wallet it just doesn't generate the addresses private key.\n\ni tried loading to litecoinqt and bitcoinqt regtest too it has time stamps for address but no key\n\n\nAttempt to getnewaddress in Dogecoin Core leads to error: \"ReseveKeyFromKeyPool: unknown key in key pool (code -1)\"\n\nThis is an analogous issue with bitcoin: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7463\n\nCan provide further information if you have had any success with this before.\n\n\ni will not send the wallet but you can reach me on linkedin @ linkedin.com/in/in-\n\n__Originally posted by @etherx-dev in https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1879__",
