It might be better to allow devs to write some non-production code in rust. For example, let them write the unit tests in rust if they wish to do so. This wouldn't be much different than the option to write tests today in either C++ or Python.\r\n\r\nI understand that your goal is to make the newly added code optional by effectively duplicating it, but the more-than-doubling of the review and maintenance burden is reason enough to Approach NACK this pull. Wasn't one of the suggestions last time this came up to have a separate net-processing module written in rust that speaks with Bitcoin Core to give it blocks (completely separate from the existing C++ net-processing)?",

If that's a direction people want to go in, integration of a existing, functioning, library with a limited interface is probably one of the better places to start. As @MarcoFalke says, something test-only at first might be even better.\n\nRegarding cuckoo filters... they're great, and there are really nice ways of using them for rolling probabilistic data structures.\n\nI don't think this library is really what we want though. As I understand it, it deletes random elements when they overflow. That implies that there is basically 0 minimal retaining time for elements in the filter. For m_addr_known I don't think that matters very much, but we have half a dozen other RollingBloomFilters, and for some of them the guaranteed time of retaining matters.\n\nI'm a bit biased here of course; @gmaxwell and I have done some research on constructing a rolling cuckoo filter, and found a way to build one with pretty good properties. I have a old branch, but it may be a while before I get it picked up again.",
