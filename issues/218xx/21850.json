   "body" : "This PR is a follow up PR to #21244. The PR attempts to move us an inch towards the [goal](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21244#discussion_r615307465) by removing `GetDataDir(net_specific)` and replacing it by `gArgs.GetDataDir(net_specific)` calls. \r\n\r\nThe approach of this PR attempts to be similar to the one chosen in \"De-globalize ChainstateManager\" (#20158). The goal is to pass `ArgsManager` to functions (or ideally to have `ArgsManager` as a member of a class where needed; inspiration from here: #21789) instead of having it as a global variable (i.e. `gArgs`).\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n* First commit makes `m_cached_blocks_path` `mutable` as was suggested [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21244#discussion_r615274095) but not fully applied in #21244. (`m_cached_datadir_path` and `m_cached_network_datadir_path` were marked as `mutable` in #21244) This commit can be in a separate PR too.\r\n* Other commits deal with removing of `GetDataDir(net_specific)` function.\r\n    * This was originally part of #21244 but it was [left]((https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21244#pullrequestreview-633779754)) for a follow up PR.\r\n* I think that the proposed changes show nicely where there is reliance on `gArgs` which is IMO a good thing.\r\n\r\nIf you know about a better approach how to do this, please share it here.",
