      "body" : "So the problem here (I think) is that the Core repo and the GUI repo have to share the same issue templates. As @MarcoFalke states [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/321#issuecomment-833371003) the GUI repo is a monotree. So any change made to the issue templates in the main repo must also be somewhat effective for the GUI repo. And vice versa, any change made to the issue templates in the GUI repo must be somewhat effective for the main repo.\r\n\r\nI agree that having an issue template referring to the GUI in addition to other templates not referring to the GUI in the GUI repo is suboptimal. But (I think) how it is currently set up is as good as we can get due to the monotree setup. The most important thing is that people know to go from the main repo to the GUI repo to open a GUI issue without prompting from reviewers. I think this is as clear as we can get with the current setup without worsening the issue opening experience further on one of the two repos.\r\n\r\nThanks for trying to improve this experience. I'm happy to be corrected if you find a way of improving the issue opening experience on one repo without worsening the issue opening experience on the other repo :)",
