I found that most bugs fall into one of the categories:\r\n* Silent merge conflict (forgetting to update the fuzz target after code changes)\r\n* A bug in the fuzz target itself\r\n* A recently introduced critical (exploitable) bug, but only present in the `master` main developement branch\r\n* A minor (non-exploitable) bug, potentially present in previous releases\r\n\r\nI believe none of the previously found bugs would warrant an extended disclosure timeline. However, it is not possible to exclude that such a bug may be found. For the hopefully extremely rare case, we may opt to hide a bug report for longer than 90 days. See https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/739#issuecomment-614831028 for an example where a longer deadline would be needed.",

Maybe there could be a bigger document about what considerations go into disclosures that this could link to later.\r\n\r\nI don't know all the details but my understanding of google's policy and our arrangement with google is that we (presumably contacts from https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/pull/5699) just have control over what shows up in the dashboard. We plan to follow google's policies and disclose as much as possible as quickly as possible, but google's policies allow exceptions in \"extreme circumstances\" (https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/02/feedback-and-data-driven-updates-to.html), and in our case where we are concerned about the health of a live network where updates happen over time, and effects from non-updated nodes can spill over to updated nodes, we're just trying to be straightforward about the fact that exceptions may be a little more likely for our application than some other ones, and that the existence of the dashboard doesn't imply automated or guaranteed disclosure. Disclosure is going to continue to be imperfect process where people are going to try to use their intuition and judgement, the same way they always have. It's good to have policies and to document policies, but I don't think anybody thinks we are or should be trapped by some policy.",
