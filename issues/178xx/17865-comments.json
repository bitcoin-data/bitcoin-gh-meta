This is to avoid timeouts in case you out of the machine :) I was looking for another way but thats all I got to keep it multiplatform. On the other hand - you don't want to change the timeout, for security reasons. Again, Im not a fan of extra lines as well, but thats all I could get to keep it across all platforms. Just retrograding.",
