   "body" : "Not the most important optimization, as these functions aren't used much, but came across this when reviewing #17808 and as I had this already implemented years ago when developing my own embedded / real-time libc, decided why not to send a PR here.\r\n\r\nASCII was designed clever enough so that you can convert from lowercase to uppercase and vice versa by just flipping a single bit instead of doing addition and subtraction. Maybe some comment could be added about this, but I think it's a well known bit hack. In addition, adding `const` to parameter will not hurt, at least in my tests it made code smaller.\r\n\r\nAlso noticed that `ToUpper()` is only used in unit tests and nowhere else, but it makes sense to keep both functions, probably it will be useful someday in future.",
