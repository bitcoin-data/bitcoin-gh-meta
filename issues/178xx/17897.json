   "body" : "Replaces https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17852.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the latest index state may not be committed to disk on shutdown. The state is committed on `ChainStateFlushed` callbacks and the current init order unregisters the indexes as validation interfaces before the final `ChainStateFlushed` callback is called on them.\r\n\r\nIssue identified by paulyc.\r\n\r\nFor review: an alternative or supplemental solution would be to call `Commit` at the end of `BaseIndex::Stop`. I don't see any harm in doing so and it makes the less prone to user error. However, the destructor would have to be modified to not call `Stop` because `Commit` calls a virtual method, so I figured it wasn't worth it. But I'm curious how others feel.",
