Otherwise, I don't think it's even very important to update the help string because as carl says https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17813#issuecomment-597887462 it's possible to interpret it correctly even now\r\n\r\nVery much recommend PRs that do one thing at a time, keep refactoring separate from behavior changes, and explicitly state what behavior is changing when it is changing",

The [question](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17813#issue-543205613) in this issue was:\r\n> What should be fixed: the help message or `configure` behavior?\r\n\r\nBasing on @laanwj's [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6938#issuecomment-153757477) I initially have suggested the changes to `configure` behavior in #17836 (which is closed now).\r\n\r\nThen, thanks to your and Carl's clarifications, it became clear that only the help string is ambiguous and requires a bit of modification. That was suggested in #18361.\r\n\r\n> I'd advise separating these things and just making a PR to just clarify the help string if you think it needs clarification, and keeping #18297 separate. Otherwise, I don't think it's even very important to update the help string because as carl says #17813 (comment) it's possible to interpret it correctly even now\r\n\r\nThe rationale: as #18297 introduces a regression (on Windows `configure` fails if depends are built with `DEBUG=1`), #18298 seems its natural followup. To make changes in #18298 clear and easy to review refactoring of `AC_ARG_WITH([gui]...)` is required, what is done in #18361.\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind the goal is #18307, the suggested chain of changes is: #18297 -> #18361 -> #18298 -> #18307.\r\n\r\nIIUC, separating #18361 from other prs will make things easier to reviewers on the path to #18307, right?",
