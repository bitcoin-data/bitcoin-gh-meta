This is essential in a multi-wallet setup.\r\n\r\nI'm submitting to seek concept ACK and/or suggestions.\r\n\r\nCurrently the published message contains the wallet name (lengh + bytes) followed by 32 bytes of the wallet transaction. Also considering to include the change (added, updated, removed) but I'm open for suggestions.\r\n\r\nCurrently working on extending the test `test/functional/interface_zmq.py` as well as `contrib/zmq/zmq_sub.py` and relevant documentation.\r\n",
