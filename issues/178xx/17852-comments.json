      "body" : "@paulyc Oh, thank you, very nice catch. This is happening because the txindex (and the other indices) are stopped in `Shutdown` (init.cpp) before `ForceFlushStateToDisk` is called. `ForceFlushStateToDisk` triggers the `ChainStateFlushed` callback on the indices which commits the indexed state to disk. So probably the best solution is to move the index stops after that. Alternately, `BaseIndex::Stop` can just call `Commit` directly. Or do both, because I don't see a downside to either approach.",
