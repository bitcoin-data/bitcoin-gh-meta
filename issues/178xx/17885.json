   "body" : "https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/build_msvc/README.md contains a description about how to build with Visual Studio.\r\nIt suggests a way to deal with external dependency libraries but still isn't a straightforward process and it's very time consuming to setup such an environment, as evidenced by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17864\r\n\r\nwould be nice to have an easy to use docker image that can be used to build bitcoin, with needed dependencies already there\r\n\r\nit seems Visual Studio Code has an extension that allow you to develop inside a container, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers , so this would be the perfect solution to have an easy to use environment to build bitcoin, would be possible to have such feature implemented?\r\n\r\n(I'm not aware of something similar for Visual Studio 2019, would be nice to have it supported too)\r\n",
