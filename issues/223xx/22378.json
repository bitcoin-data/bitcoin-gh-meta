   "body" : "This is a very late follow-up PR to #10618, which removed the constant `MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE` from the core implementation about four years ago (see also #10608 in why it was considered confusing and superfluous).\r\nSince there is also no point in still keeping it in the functional test framework, the PR switches to weight-based accounting on the relevant test code parts and use `MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT` instead for the block limit checks. To prepare that, the first two commits introduce `get_weight()` helpers for the classes CTransaction and CBlock, respectively.",
