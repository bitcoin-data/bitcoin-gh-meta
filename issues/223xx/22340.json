   "body" : "A blocks-only node does not participate in transaction relay to reduce its own bandwidth usage and therefore does not have a mempool. The use of compact blocks is not beneficial to such a node since it will always have to download full blocks. \r\n\r\nIn both high- and low-bandwidth relaying the `cmpctblock` message is sent. This represent a bandwidth overhead for blocks-only nodes because the `cmpctblock` message is several times larger in the average case than the equivalent `headers` or `inv` announcement. \r\n\r\n![compact blocks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoin/bips/master/bip-0152/protocol-flow.png)\r\n\r\n>**Example:**\r\n>A block with 2000 txs results in a `cmpctblock` with 2000*6 bytes in short ids. This is several times larger than the equivalent 82 bytes for a `headers` message or 37 bytes for an `inv`.\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n\r\nThis PR makes blocks-only nodes always use the legacy relaying to download new blocks.\r\nIt does so by making blocks-only nodes never initiate a high-bandwidth block relay connection by disabling the sending of `sendcmpct(1)`. Additionally a blocks-only node will never request a compact block using `getdata(CMPCT)`.\r\n\r\nA blocks-only node will continue to serve compact blocks to its peers in both high- and low-bandwidth mode.",
