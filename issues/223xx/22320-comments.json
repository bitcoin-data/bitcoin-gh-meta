However, anyone compiling there, can use depends. They can also no-longer use the system GCC (6.0), and I'd assume would be using Clang 7, which would be the newest compiler available to them. It's extended, LTS support also end in 1 year from now, so anyone still using it should be considering upgrading.\r\n\r\nDebian Buster (Stable) has 1.67+, Ubuntu Bionic has 1.65+, any of the BSDs, recent Fedora, macOS etc all also have well and truly new enough Boost versions available.\r\n\r\nI think this is something we should just do for 22.0. If not, definitely for 23.0.\r\n\r\nFixes #22319. Compiling Bitcoin Core should work, as windows.h will be included.\r\nAlternative to #22294.\r\nWould also close #22269.\r\n#19128 could be re-opened.",
