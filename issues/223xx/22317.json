Lot of users might skip reading it because of the way it is mixed with everything else in the doc right now\r\n3. I have seen lot of users ignoring DNS requests or unaware of such things while using privacy tools\r\n\r\n_How?_\r\n\r\nInitially I had tried keeping these lines separate from code block but [Jonatack didn't agree with the changes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21157#discussion_r618177116). Harding suggested using [bold/italic in `<pre></pre>`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21157#discussion_r644364143). I have used the suggestions from previous PR and added `---`\r\n\r\nThis is a part of alternative described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22316",
