   "body" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem?**\r\nUTXO locks are stored in memory only. Nodes start with zero locked outputs, and the locked output list is always cleared (by virtue of process exit) when a node stops or fails. It was added as memory-only filter in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1861/\r\n\r\nFew users wanted persistency for locking unspent in issue: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14907 but it was closed in May 2020 because of lack of interest.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like:**\r\nUse wallet db for locked UTXOs\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered:**\r\nUse other wallets\r\n\r\n**Additional context:**\r\nI tried fixing this, initially had issues related to [wrong use of vector in C++](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/106701/use-wallet-db-for-locked-utxos-in-bitcoin-core) and could never resolve it after trying few things.\r\n\r\nI think it will be easy for devs who work on wallet related issues in Bitcoin Core or anyone else good with C++. Would appreciate if someone could fix this and improve privacy in Core wallet.\r\n",
