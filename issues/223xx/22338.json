The comment in the test has been updated to accurately reflect what is going on.</s>\r\n\r\nBased on Aj's comment, I have changed the PR so that it renames the constants/functions that operate on PreTapScript Scripts. \r\n\r\nI don't know if this is the ideal way to separate pre-tapscripts and tapscripts.  If the new PR is not useful, feel free to close it. ",
