Pulling up the Task Manager I can see Core running but after about 30 seconds it simply disappears.  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling then removing the file directory and reinstalling but the application still will not run.  I'm assuming what is described here is the same issue I'm seeing so rather than creating a new issue I thought I'd try commenting.\r\n\r\nMy windows specs...\r\nEdition\tWindows 10 Pro\r\nVersion\t21H1\r\nOS build\t19043.1083\r\nExperience\tWindows Feature Experience Pack 120.2212.3530.0\r\n ",
