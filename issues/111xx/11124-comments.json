Out of scope perhaps, but it might be useful to have a wallet setting \"use SegWit\". This would cause new (change and receive) addresses to be SegWit by default.\r\n\r\nBIP 49 uses different private keys for SegWit vs. non-SegWit addresses. But BIP 44 is a prerequisite for that.

Segwit locked in in August, meaning that GUI implementation will be lagging by a minimum of three quarters.  Segwit transaction adoption will remain low until segwit becomes the default transaction type in all major wallets, and Bitcoin Core is of course the biggest of them all.\r\n\r\nI'm curious about the prioritization here.  Bottlenecked transaction throughput and the resultant high fees are big problems facing Bitcoin, and are driving users away to altcoins like BCH.  Segwit is part of the fix for this problem, and yet we're not seeing anything close to the same fervor in making segwit usable to end users as we saw in getting it locked in in the first place.\r\n\r\nShould we be recommending that people switch to using wallets with full segwit support, like Electrum?  I've been using Bitcoin Core since 2011, and I trust it, but at this point I'm seriously considering switching instead of waiting at least half a year.",
