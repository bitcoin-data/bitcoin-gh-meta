   "body" : "We are using the travis cache to speed up builds. However, the caches are quite large. They are in the order of 11 GBs for each branch and each pull request, which puts the total usage we put on travis in the order of Terabytes. They don't charge us for cache space, but I believe it still slows down our builds.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_2020-04-16 bitcoin bitcoin - Travis CI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6399679/79462822-05749500-7fc6-11ea-8be2-71999e50a528.png)\r\n\r\nOur ccache size is limited to 100 Mb.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e16718a8b3db8bf9c9715f28f4dc6080bf609776/ci/test/00_setup_env.sh#L43\r\n\r\nHowever, some build don't pick up this setting.\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/github/bitcoin/bitcoin/jobs/675498487#L3995\r\n\r\n#### Useful skills:\r\n\r\nBasic understanding of the Bitcoin Core ci system, travis, ccache and our build system.\r\n\r\n#### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this.
