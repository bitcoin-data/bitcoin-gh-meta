   "body" : "**This is based on #21353.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`7a05b1dee2f` refactor: Remove CAddressBookData::destdata](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18608/commits/7a05b1dee2fa68b32bfb19e273fb55a5b3836a3e)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is cleanup that doesn't change external behavior.\r\n\r\n- Removes awkward `StringMap` intermediate representation\r\n- Deals with receive request \"rr\" keys in walletdb.cpp instead of all over qt, wallet, and interfaces code\r\n- Deals with destination \"used\" keys in walletdb.cpp instead of all over wallet code\r\n- Adds test coverage\r\n- Reduces code (+85/-138 lines)\r\n- Reduces memory usage\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't change externally observable behavior. Internally, only change in behavior is that EraseDestData deletes directly from database because the `StringMap` is gone. This is more direct and efficient because it uses a single btree lookup and scan instead of multiple lookups\r\n\r\nMotivation for this cleanup is making changes like #18550, #18192, #13756 easier to reason about and less likely to result in unintended behavior and bugs\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",
