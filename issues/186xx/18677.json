   "body" : "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR consists of build changes only. It adds an `--enable-multiprocess` autoconf option (off by default and marked experimental), that builds new `bitcoin-node` and `bitcoin-gui` binaries. These currently function the same as existing `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt` binaries, but are extended in #10102 with IPC features to execute node, wallet, and gui functions in separate processes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to adding the `--enable-multiprocess` config flag, it also adds a depends package and autoconf rules to build with the [libmultiprocess](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess) library, and it adds new travis configuration to exercise the build code and run functional tests with the new binaries.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR were originally part of #10102 but were moved into #16367 to be able to develop and review the multiprocess build changes independently of the code changes. #16367 was briefly merged and then reverted in #18588. Only change since #16367 has been dropping the `native_boost.mk` depends package which was pointed out to be no longer necessary in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16367#issuecomment-596484337 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18588#pullrequestreview-391765649",
