On Linux a build with ccache finishes in a few minutes. On Windows it takes almost an hour, even with clcache. clcache apparently had no effect on the build time and has been removed in #18640 \r\n\r\nIf someone has background in Windows build systems, they could help us speed up the build or even enable the functional tests again.\r\n\r\nMaybe the issue is with appveyor, so an option could be to port the appveyor yaml to travis or cirrus ci and see if that fixes the problem.\r\n\r\n#### Useful skills:\r\n\r\nExperience with Windows powershell and Windows build systems\r\n\r\n#### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this. You are encouraged to comment on the issue if you are planning to work on it.
