   "body" : "When writing tests, often includes need to be added or removed. Currently the list of includes is not sorted, so developers that write tests and have `clang-format` installed will either have an unrelated change (sorting) included in their commit or they will have to manually undo the sort.\r\n\r\nThis pull preempts both issues by just sorting all includes in one commit.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that this is **NOT** a change to policy to enforce clang-format or any other developer guideline or process. Developers are free to use whatever tool they want, see also #18651.\r\n\r\nEdit: Also includes a commit to bump the copyright headers, so that the touched files don't need to be touched again for that.",
