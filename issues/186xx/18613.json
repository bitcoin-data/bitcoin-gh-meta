   "body" : "This has come up in some testing related stuff I've been working on... Opening as a WIP because a lot of stuff fails as a result and trying to decide if it's worth fixing or if I should ignore it...\r\n\r\nCurrently:\r\n```python\r\nCScript([\"hello\", \"world\"]) != CScript([\"hello\"]) + CScript([\"world\"])\r\n\r\nCScript([\"hello\"]) + CScript([\"world\"]) == CScript([\"hello\", \"\\x06\\x05world\") == CScript([\"hello\", CScript([\"world\"]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem like there's a way to reach `CScript([\"hello\", \"world\"])` other than by chaining the iterators together, which is clunky.\r\n\r\nThis patch redefines addition of scripts such that:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nCScript([\"hello\", \"world\"]) == CScript([\"hello\"]) + CScript([\"world\"])\r\n\r\nCScript([\"hello\"]) + CScript([\"world\"]) != (CScript([\"hello\", \"\\x06\\x05world\") == CScript([\"hello\", CScript([\"world\"])))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that adding a raw bytes to a CScript preserves the old behavior, e.g., `CScript([\"hello\"]) + \"world\" == CScript([\"hello\", \"world\"])`.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to this is to get rid of the `nested` parameter to `__coerce_instance` and always leave CScript as concatenative -- e.g., `CScript([a,CScript([b])]) == CScript([a,b]) == CScript([a]) + CScript([a,b])` and you have to coerce to bytes first to get a push. This breaks fewer tests, but seems a bit more subtle?",
