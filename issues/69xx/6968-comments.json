There are no\n known problems when downgrading from 0.11.x to 0.10.x.\n \n-Notable changes\n-===============\n-\n-Fix buffer overflow in bundled upnp\n-------------------------------------\n-\n-Bundled miniupnpc was updated to 1.9.20151008. This fixes a buffer overflow in\n-the XML parser during initial network discovery.\n-\n-Details can be found here: http://talosintel.com/reports/TALOS-2015-0035/\n-\n-This applies to the distributed executables only, not when building from source or\n-using distribution provided packages.\n-\n-Additionally, upnp has been disabled by default. This may result in a lower\n-number of reachable nodes on IPv4, however this prevents future libupnpc\n-vulnerabilities from being a structural risk to the network\n-(see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6795).\n-\n-Test for LowS signatures before relaying\n------------------------------------------\n-\n-Make the node require the canonical 'low-s' encoding for ECDSA signatures when\n-relaying or mining.  This removes a nuisance malleability vector.\n-\n-Consensus behavior is unchanged.\n-\n-If widely deployed this change would eliminate the last remaining known vector\n-for nuisance malleability on SIGHASH_ALL P2PKH transactions. On the down-side\n-it will block most transactions made by sufficiently out of date software.\n-\n-Unlike the other avenues to change txids on transactions this\n-one was randomly violated by all deployed bitcoin software prior to\n-its discovery. So, while other malleability vectors where made\n-non-standard as soon as they were discovered, this one has remained\n-permitted. Even BIP62 did not propose applying this rule to\n-old version transactions, but conforming implementations have become\n-much more common since BIP62 was initially written.\n-\n-Bitcoin Core has produced compatible signatures since a28fb70e in\n-September 2013, but this didn't make it into a release until 0.9\n-in March 2014; Bitcoinj has done so for a similar span of time.\n-Bitcoinjs and electrum have been more recently updated.\n-\n-This does not replace the need for BIP62 or similar, as miners can\n-still cooperate to break transactions.  Nor does it replace the\n-need for wallet software to handle malleability sanely[1]. This\n-only eliminates the cheap and irritating DOS attack.\n-\n-[1] On the Malleability of Bitcoin Transactions\n-Marcin Andrychowicz, Stefan Dziembowski, Daniel Malinowski, Åukasz Mazurek\n-http://fc15.ifca.ai/preproceedings/bitcoin/paper_9.pdf\n-\n-Minimum relay fee default increase\n------------------------------------\n-\n-The default for the `-minrelaytxfee` setting has been increased from `0.00001`\n-to `0.00005`.\n-\n-This is necessitated by the current transaction flooding, causing\n-outrageous memory usage on nodes due to the mempool ballooning. This is a\n-temporary measure, bridging the time until a dynamic method for determining\n-this fee is merged (which will be in 0.12).\n-\n-(see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6793, as well as the 0.11\n-release notes, in which this value was suggested)\n+Notable changes since 0.11.1\n+============================\n+\n+BIP65 soft fork to enforce OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode\n+--------------------------------------------------------\n+\n+This release includes several changes related to the [BIP65][] soft fork\n+which redefines the existing OP_NOP2 opcode as OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY\n+(CLTV) so that a transaction output can be made unspendable until a\n+specified point in the future.\n+\n+1. This release will only relay and mine transactions spending a CLTV\n+   output if they comply with the BIP65 rules as provided in code.\n+\n+2. This release will produce version 4 blocks by default. Please see the\n+   *notice to miners below*.\n+\n+3. Once 951 out of a sequence of 1,001 blocks on the local node's best block\n+   chain contain version 4 (or higher) blocks, this release will no\n+   longer accept new version 3 blocks and it will only accept version 4\n+   blocks if they comply with the BIP65 rules for CLTV.\n+\n+For more information about the soft-forking change, please see\n+<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6351>\n+\n+**Notice to miners:** Bitcoin Coreâs block templates are now for\n+version 4 blocks only, and any mining software relying on its\n+getblocktemplate must be updated in parallel to use libblkmaker either\n+version FIXME or any version from FIXME onward.",

This confuses my administration - and referring to a pull like \"backport fixes\" in the release notes isn't that useful. But we can live with that, better next time.\n\n> @sipa Yea, the leveldb fix change is big news for a lot of people. Unfortunately we don't have the AV robustness (chainstate obfsucation) so we can't say that ALL known common sources of corruption on windows are gone.\n\nIt's not that I didn't try: #6919. But it was to controversial for a backport apparently.\n",
