Specifically:\n- for each transaction you compute the bitcoin-days-destroyed\n- divide it by the average UTXO entry age weighed by amount (around 800 days currently)\n- the result is a value in BTC; take some configurable fraction of it (0.5% for example)\n- treat the result as extra fee (which gets divided by the tx size to obtain the feerate).\n\nThis is simple (don't bother recalculating this equivalent fee on every mempool change; just infrequently in the background or even not at all and keep using the value from entry time), and using 0.5% as factor would give a 250-byte 1 BTC-day-destroyed transaction (the limit for high priority earlier) the equivalent of 2500 satoshi/kB feerate boost.\n\nThe downside is that it has no guarantees on how much a miner could lose by using this approach. For example, 100 BTC of 1 year old coins would be treated equal to a 1 BTC fee. We can cap the maximum amount of feerate replaced, but that may make the scheme pretty useless if the cap is easy to hit.\n",

I sort of assumed there was enough hashpower mining with priority, since last time I checked estimatepriority was still giving meaningful results for low-ish blockheights, but I haven't done any kind of real analysis.\n",

However I think we backed ourselves into a bit of a corner by not more clearly communicating and building consensus that priority based transactions were going away before now.   \n\nWe can of course still do that, but I don't like releasing a 0.12 which breaks priority before that has happened.  If we had no choice, then thats one thing, but if a few peoples time to review this code is all it takes to avoid that scenario, we should avoid it.   \n\nWe need to make an analogous decision with respect to #6357.  If we're ok making miners who are using priority space only care about the starting priority of the tx for filling that space (the same way this pull uses that for eviction), then we can skip #6357, but otherwise we have to have it in order to speed up CreateNewBlock.\n",

The patch has worked so far, but the transactions were probably mined before my mempool was full.\n2.

Obviously if this PR is merged, I'll modify #6134 to look at the appropriate minimum priority of the mempool instead if the mempool reject fee is non zero.\n\n@MarcoFalke I don't think its possible to accomplish the same goals by translating priority into fee.\n\n@TheBlueMatt Yes thats part of what I don't like about the current state of affairs, its so inconsistent. If we can build consensus to remove priority, then lets do that.  Until then, lets continue to support it.\n\nWhey don't we issue a release note saying supporting free priority based transactions is deprecated.\n",

(If we do set the default block priority size to 0, I'll need to update this pull to change its default behavior to include a priority space in the mempool anyway.)\n\nIn a future release (maybe 0.13), we can consider removing priority support from CreateNewBlock  (especially if indeed miners stop using priority after the defaults are changed) and from the mempool.\n",

I have not been able to reproduce #6972 or #6959 using this patch. \n\nWhen comparing periodic output from getmempoolinfo on the node running this patch since yesterday, and a different node which run current git version as of two days ago, more transactions are removed from the mempool for each new block on the node running this patch.  Mempool size is the same.  The difference is usually between 50 and 200 transactions, but hardware differences may be a factor here as well.  Nevertheless it is an indication that this version keep more of the transactions most likely to be mined in mempool.  I will try this patch with a smaller mempool on the weaker hardware, and see if it still performs better.\n",

One is against removing priority (Luke-Jr).\n\nAs long as priority is supported, this patch is wanted by at least me, as it fixes two bugs and works very well in my testing.  It is much better than the current mempool limiting code at keeping transactions which will go into the next block.\n",
