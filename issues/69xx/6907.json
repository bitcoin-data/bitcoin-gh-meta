   "body" : "This makes it simpler for people to create new testchains in their own branches by removing the need to create a new static global variable for the new chains.\n\nIt also prepares chainparams and chainparamsbase to be cleaned out of globals by moving the globals and related functions (`Params(), SelectParams()`, etc) outside, maybe to globals/server.o and globals/common.o respectively.\n\nBut that would need another PR after this, something @theuni has been wanting to do for some time.\nI would prefer to do this first to be able to leave the 2 factories (which don't need to depend on any global) where they are. \nPart of #6382\n",
