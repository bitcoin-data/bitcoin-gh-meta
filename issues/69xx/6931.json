   "body" : "Since BIP 34 became active, it has been impossible to generate duplicate coinbases, and therefore not possible to generate any other duplicate transaction ID's.\n\nThis pull will allow us to skip BIP 30 verification if we know we are on a chain after the point BIP 34 was activated and there are no latent duplicate transaction chains.  \nOn mainnet there were 2 cases of duplicate coinbases, and in both cases the duplicate overwrote the original before there was an opportunity to spend it.\n~~I have not actually verified that there are no duplicate coinbases on testnet3, and we need to verify that or turn off the skipping on testnet before merging this pull.~~ (EDIT: verified)\n\nIn conjunction with #6932 this will help ConnectBlock be much more efficient with caching access to the database.\n",
