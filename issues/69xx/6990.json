What I expected was that it sets a timeout, given that no other pending events it would exit in N seconds. However, what it does was delay the event loop exit with N seconds, even if nothing is pending.\n\nSolve it in a different way: give the event loop thread time to exit out of itself, and if it doesn't, send loopbreak (and then join it).\n\nThis speeds up the RPC tests a lot, each exit incurred a 10 second overhead, with this change there should be no shutdown overhead in the common case and up to two seconds if the event loop is blocking.\n\nAs a bonus this breaks dependency on the global boost::thread_group, as the HTTP server minds its own offspring.\n\nTime for rpctests with this patch:\n\n```\nreal    7m50.215s\nuser    0m30.152s\nsys     0m11.752s\n```\n\nWithout:\n\n```\nreal    13m12.069s\nuser    0m30.412s\nsys     0m11.168s\n```\n",
