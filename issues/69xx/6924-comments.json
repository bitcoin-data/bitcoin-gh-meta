It is impossible for a fixed string to not leak into memory at any point, especially not consistent over platforms. A hammer solution on Linux is to set `mallopt(M_PERTURB)`. This will overwrite all memory when allocated _and_ when deallocated. That will impact performance (not something we'll do for the entire process by default) and still leaves the stack (per thread) to contend with.\n\nYou could also scan the entire memory space periodically using e.g. some moving hash window and wipe the passphrase when found in inactive memory :-) (but mind the the passphrase may still be there in some other form, such as a list of keyboard scancodes ..)\n\nA less fragile (and more serious) solution would be to use, instead of a fixed passphrase, a challenge/response system between a) a sandboxed signing process b) the API client / a secure GUI overlay. This is the only way that has any chance to mitigate remote memory contents leaking.\n",
