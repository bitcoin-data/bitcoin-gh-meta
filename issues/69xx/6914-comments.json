The cscripts themselves in these entries are never mutated at all.\n\nThe mutation that decreases the entry size could be addressed by flagging their deletion, and a separate operation which compacts the coins cache (e.g. takes txouts which many deleted entries and packs then reallocs them to a smaller size)-- e.g. it could be run on flush (which scans for modified entries) as well as periodically when flusing is infrequent (e.g. db cache set to infinity), perhaps triggered by an overhead counter (which would be cheap to maintain).  This would eliminate quite a few more malloc operations and further reduce fragmentation; but I suspect it would be a much bigger change than just changing the type of cscripts.\n",

It will also see a _lot_ more testing if its merged for 0.12 (as I will have multiple people working full time on testing the 0.12 and the next elements update that will be 0.12 based). \n",
