It'd be far preferable to minimize the input set if no reasonable (e.g. under the maxtxfee) solution could not be found, and then the wallet owner would consolidate those inputs. \r\n\r\n>  In the long run, coins will be ground to dust and thus cost a lot more to spend.\r\n\r\nThat's only true if you assume transaction fees go up with time, but it's often exactly the opposite: most commercial users (especially merchants) periodically consolidate their inputs at a tiny fraction the feerate of when they generate normal transactions.",
