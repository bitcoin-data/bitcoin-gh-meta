   "body" : "This PR was split from #14906 and is a prerequisite for it.\r\nIt updates tests and benchmarks, removing all implicit calls to `CTransaction(CMutableTransaction&)` constructors. This will make possible making the constructor explicit in the next PR.\r\nThe original rationale for making the constructor explicit:\r\n\r\n - Conversion constructors should not be explicit unless there's a strong reason for it (in the opinion of, for example, https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html, and https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Ro-conversion. Let me know your take on this).\r\n - This particular conversion is very costly -- it implies a serialization plus hash of the transaction.\r\n - Even though `CTransaction` and `CMutableTransaction` represent the same data, they have very different use cases and performance properties.\r\n - Making it explicit allows for easier reasoning of performance trade-offs.\r\n - There has been previous performance issues caused by unneeded use of this implicit conversion.\r\n - This PR creates a map for places to look for possible refactoring and performance gains (this benefit still holds if the PR is not merged).",
