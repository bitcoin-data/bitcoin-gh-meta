I think we should avoid persisting state in the wallet file.\r\n\r\n@promag Sorry but I dont understand the first part. How does loading and unloading wallet solve this problem because if I restart bitcoind/bitcoin-qt, locks are gone.\r\n\r\nWhat are the issues in saving locks in wallet file? I see only positives",

      "body" : "@prayank23, my suggestion was as simple as splitting the wallet in two and then load the 2nd only when you want to spend. Obviously this is limited especially with address reuse. In the past, I had to store utxos locks on the side and sync the wallet with that.. so I'd appreciate this feature at the time.",
