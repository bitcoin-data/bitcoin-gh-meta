The indexes and chainstate databases will remain in the datadir. So you can specify your datadir to be your SSD, and the blocksdir to be your hard drive.\r\n\r\n>  For PCs which are equipped with more than 8GB of RAM but without SSDs, there's another solution: loading all files placed in chainstate into memory before launching the full node.\r\n\r\nUse the `-dbcache` option to increase the size of the database cache. This will cache the chainstate database in memory. If it is larger than 8000 (8 GB), then the entire chainstate database will be cached in memory.",

Because I still remember the old days waiting for the node to sync when I was still a outright noob (then I'm proud to be an experienced noob now). At that time I also worried about whether my precious non-SMR (CMR) HDD would break after putting such a such a crazy intensive I/O burden on it - as we all know, HDD vendors are shameless enough to silently push unlabeled DM-SMR drives to the consumer market.",
