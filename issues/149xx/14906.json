   "body" : "This PR is re-submission of #14156, which was automatically closed by github (glitch?)\r\n\r\nOriginal description: \r\n\r\nThis PR makes explicit the now implicit conversion constructor `CTransaction(const CMutableTransaction&)` in `transaction.h`. \r\nMinimal changes were made elsewhere to make the code compilable. I'll follow up with other PRs to address individually refactoring functions that should have a `CMutableTransaction` version, or where a `CTransaction` should be reused. \r\n\r\nThe rationale for this change is:\r\n\r\n - Conversion constructors should not be explicit unless there's a strong reason for it (in the opinion of, for example, https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html, and https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Ro-conversion. Let me know your take on this).\r\n - This particular conversion is very costly -- it implies a serialization plus hash of the transaction.\r\n - Even though `CTransaction` and `CMutableTransaction` represent the same data, they have very different use cases and performance properties.\r\n - Making it explicit allows for easier reasoning of performance trade-offs.\r\n - There has been previous performance issues caused by unneeded use of this implicit conversion.\r\n - This PR creates a map for places to look for possible refactoring and performance gains (this benefit still holds if the PR is not merged).",
