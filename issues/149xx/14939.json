   "body" : "`testmempoolaccept` RPC is useful for checking if signed raw transaction can be accepted into the current transaction pool, however there is no available mechanism from checking whether an still unsigned transaction could be accepted or not, except for the fact that is not signed yet. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds an optional parameter that provides a way for the caller to specify the script evaluation should is skipped. Services that build transactions collectively require to perform several rpc calls in order to verify that built transaction could be accepted before requesting the parts to sign it. This flag could simplify that process.  \r\n\r\nFixes #14859",
