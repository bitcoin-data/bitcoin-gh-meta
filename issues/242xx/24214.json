   "body" : "Unsigned interger overflow is well defined by the language and in some cases even useful or necessary. However, I think that it should be avoided in interpreter, as it makes the code harder to read and requires the whole file to be suppressed in the sanitizer. This puts more burden on reviewers to check that any changes to interpreter that involve unsigned integer overflow are sane.\r\n\r\nThis patch involves three changes:\r\n* Change the tapscript validation weight constants from uint64_t to int64_t, since the type of `m_validation_weight_left` is also int64_t\r\n* Clarify that the value passed to the \"stack macros\" is always an `int`. This is done with the C++11 syntax `int{i}`, which fails to compile if `i` needs to be narrowed to fit into `int`.\r\n* Convert the stack size from `size_t` to `int` for the addition. This should be safe, as the stack size should always fit into int and the result of the addition is positive and should also fit into both `int` and `size_t`.",
