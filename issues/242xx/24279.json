   "body" : "On master (1e7564eca8a688f39c75540877ec3bdfdde766b1) the depends build system, which is based on pure GNU Make, works, but it lacks robustness, and in some corner cases it fails. For example, see bitcoin/bitcoin#22552.\r\n\r\nAnother [bug](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/22719) in the depends build system has already become a problem at least two times in the past (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16883#issuecomment-683817472 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24134). Each time the problem was solved with other means.\r\n\r\nThe initial [solution](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19882) had some discussion. Also it was discussed on the IRC meeting in #bitcoin-core-builds channel. This PR, actually, is a resurrection of it, as the bug silently struck pretty [recently](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24134).\r\n\r\nThe bug is well described in bitcoin/bitcoin#22719.\r\n\r\nHere is another, a bit simpler description, which requires only basic shell (bash, dash etc) experience.\r\nAfter creating targets by this code:https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1e7564eca8a688f39c75540877ec3bdfdde766b1/depends/funcs.mk#L280 a \"draft\" line of recipe like `$($(1)_config_env) $(call $(1)_config_cmds, $(1))` becomes a shell command sequence `VAR1=foo VAR2=bar command1 && command2` which is supposed to be executed in a [new sub-shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Execution.html#Execution).\r\n\r\nPlease note that `VAR1=foo VAR2=bar` part is visible for the first `command1` only (for details see shell docs). Example:\r\n```sh\r\n$ VAR1=\"foo\" VAR2=\"bar\" echo \"begin\" && printenv VAR1 && printenv VAR2 && echo \"end\"\r\nbegin\r\n$ echo $?\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the `export` command is a trivial solution:\r\n```sh\r\n$ export VAR1=\"foo\" VAR2=\"bar\"; echo \"begin\" && printenv VAR1 && printenv VAR2 && echo \"end\"\r\nbegin\r\nfoo\r\nbar\r\nend\r\n$ echo $?\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a [new sub-shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Execution.html#Execution) is invoked for each line of the recipe, there are no side effects of using `export`. It means this solution should not be considered invasive.\r\n\r\nFixes bitcoin/bitcoin#22719.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso this PR removes no longer needed crutch from `qt.mk`.",
