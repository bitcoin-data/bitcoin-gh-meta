   "body" : "Dear Bitcoin Developers,\r\n\r\nI am currently working on a project where I am trying to create long term profiles of bitcoin nodes using peer information. For this purpose I need the size of the peer database. The maximum size is 81,920 due to the buckets, but in order to determine a realistic size, I have been running my own Bitcoin node for a few months. \r\nHowever, this now gives me 2 completely different numbers regarding the peer database, which I cannot explain. \r\n\r\nThe first number comes from my debug.log file, which contains all logs about incoming addresses. The following is one of the latest entries:\r\n2021-11-25T08:57:56Z Added 1 addresses (of 1) from 2001:41d0:a:69a2::1: 3678 tried, 58574 new\r\nThis entry basically gives me the information that my node currently manages more than 61,000 **unique** (no duplicates) addresses.\r\n\r\nAnother way to get the number of peers of my node are the bitcoin-cli commands \"addrinfo\" and \"getnodeaddresses\". However, using these commands I get much less (about 47,000) nodes.\r\n\r\nMy question now is how this difference can be explained and what the different numbers (i.e. the one from the debug file and the one from the cli commands) tell me about my peer database.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help,\r\n\r\nBrian",
