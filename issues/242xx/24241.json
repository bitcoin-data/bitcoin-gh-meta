   "body" : "The explicit statement that an Apple Developer Account is required in order to obtain the SDK is buried within the `Deterministic macOS DMG Notes` section. It should be the first thing mentioned under the `SDK Extraction` section.\r\nThe reason to do this is to set expectations of what is required before starting any steps or clicking on links.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the issue by doing just that; moving this information to the `SDK Extraction` section. Now that the information is moved, this also deletes unnecessary SDK related notes from the `Deterministic macOS DMG Notes` section. It is not necessary to explain under what sub-directory 'most' of the important files are inside of the `Xcode.app`.\r\n\r\nNote that this also fixes a missed Xcode version link bump by deleting it :)\r\n",
