   "body" : "Since Bitcoin Core 0.17 the startup option `upgradewallet` has been available, allowing users to upgrade old legacy wallets to HD wallets. \r\nHowever many users with non-HD wallets are yet to upgrade their wallet, to reduce complexity, and or various issues related to non-HD wallets, I am wondering if it may be a good idea to require users to upgrade.\r\n\r\nTwo different ways of implementing this (off the top of my head):\r\n- when all addresses in a keypool are marked used, automatically upgrade wallet and notify user to make a backup.\r\n- on startup upgrade wallet and notify user to make a backup\r\n\r\nAre there any reasons for why Bitcoin Core doesn't already do this?
