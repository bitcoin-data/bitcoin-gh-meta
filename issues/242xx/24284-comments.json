These are obviously not considered bad by browsers, but they are most certainly monitored by paranoid system administrators. Some websites are totally off limits for unauthenticated users. And they are heavily logged.\r\n\r\n21 is already added. Not sure about others.\r\n\r\nI think we should merge that pull request with current \"bad ports\" list so that it works only for testnet and signet in v23.0. I am not sure if this approach is used for anything in past but this would allow us to fix issues (if any) without discussing \"bad ports\" list forever.\r\n\r\nThere was no objection or feedback on mailing list as well.",
