For this I need a certain number of unique duplicates from 2 (or more) different GetAddr requests.  In order to determine how many duplicates I need in theory so that the node can be uniquely identified, I need the size of the peer database with which the node can respond to GetAddr requests.  So far I had (unconsciously) neglected the isTerrible peers, but 15,000 fewer peers can make a difference in the identification.\r\n\r\nI hadn't noticed that a node that goes back online after a month hardly delivers any old peers ... I will probably only be able to find out to what extent this hinders identification after a long test. The question here is, how long it will take to make most of the peers isTerrible=false ... ",
