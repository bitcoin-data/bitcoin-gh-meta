      "body" : "FWIW, I think this is a good idea. I recently ran into this when trying to create a fairly complicated miniscript fragment: I created the wallet with private keys enabled and copied out some of the xpubs to use in my `wsh(miniscript)` descriptor. I was then unable to import it into the wallet until I ran `listdescriptors true` and replaced the xpub with the xpriv before then re-importing.\r\n\r\nI agree that it's dangerous to require dumping the xpriv to the command line. I suppose the counter-argument is the keys would ideally be on a signing device and you would only be creating a watch-only wallet in core, but I think there is merit to supporting a hot-wallet use case, as well.",
