This is just \"good enough\" to keep things compiling, and uses some similar work-arounds as we have with other older packages, i.e bdb.\r\n\r\nNote that upstream, libqrencode is effectively unmaintained. No code changes for > 2 years. No responses to issues/PRs. Seems like the author has mostly dropped off of GitHub as well.\r\n\r\nThis fixes part of #27299.",
