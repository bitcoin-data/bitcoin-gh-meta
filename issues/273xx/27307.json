   "body" : "The `TxStateMempoolConflicted` class is added. It is serialized the same as `TxStateInactive` and `TxStateInMempool`. This is done because mempool-related states are relatively short lived, so it doesn't make sense to serialize them differently than they are on master (mempool-conflicted txs are currently marked as `TxStateInactive`). As a result, this PR only changes how these transaction are dealt with in memory.\r\n\r\nIn memory `TxStateConflicted` (which only refers to block conflicts) and `TxStateMempoolConflicted` are treated the same, which results in `IsSpent` returning false for an output being spent by a mempool conflicted transaction where it previously returned true.\r\n\r\nA transaction is marked as `TxStateMempoolConflicted` during `transactionAddedToMempool` where any transactions that conflict with the one just added to the mempool are marked as mempool-conflicted if they are not already block conflicted.\r\n\r\nA transaction is unmarked `TxStateMempoolConflicted` when the conflicting transaction is removed from the mempool for any reason other than it being added to a block (because in this case it will later be marked as block-conflicted anyways).\r\n\r\nBuilds on #27145\r\n\r\nTo-Do:\r\n- [x] Cover scenario where there are multiple mempool conflicts with the same tx\r\n- [x] Add comments to clarify certain sections\r\n- [ ] Add tests, perhaps from the first attempt of this PR\r\n\r\nSecond attempt at #18600",
