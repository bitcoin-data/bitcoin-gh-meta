I think we should definitely support the described use case.\r\n\r\nFor the approach, I think we already have some implementation ready for the second alternative you mentioned. #26728 adds support for a wallet master key (I think this is what you meant by \"global keys\"). And #23544 by @Sjors, built on top of it, adds a RPC for descriptor wallets similar to `sethdseed`.\r\n\r\nI like the alternative better because it support more use cases:\r\n\r\n1. storing wallet master key allows you to generate new descriptors for the existing master key, e.g. to add `tr` descriptors to existing wallet\r\n2. better support for multisig between core and a hardware wallet (described in #23544)",
