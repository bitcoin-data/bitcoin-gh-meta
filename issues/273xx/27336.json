To do the import, you need to pull the private keys out of the wallet, populate the descriptor with them, recompute the checksum, then try again. This is unsafe and unnecessary.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nBefore erroring out, the wallet should check whether it actually has private keys that would allow it to import the descriptor.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
