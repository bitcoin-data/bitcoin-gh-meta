   "body" : "This extracts the `Network` and `BIP155Network` logic to `node/network`.  The code has been living between `netaddress` and `netbase` and some compilation units include these large files when they only need a `Network` enum or related method.  Separating the code to a standalone unit in `node` improves code separation and helps with using only what is needed, which may reduce build size and speed up build times.\r\n\r\nI verified the `include` headers with https://cirrus-ci.com/task/6749578737745920 generated by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27385/commits/8f647a65d3484c7acd2d97f4b055c582d7734b6f while this was in draft and carefully narrowed them down to the most relevant ones.\r\n\r\nPossible todos for a follow-up: upgrade `Network` to an `enum class`, e.g. `NET_I2P` becomes `Network::I2P` and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27385/commits/5cfa3fb8b5815aaf96483a63526e5f0bf3c0a06b.",
