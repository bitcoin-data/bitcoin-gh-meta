   "body" : "Show an error on startup if a bitcoin datadir that is being used contains a `bitcoin.conf` file that is ignored. There are two cases where this could happen:\r\n\r\n- One case reported in [#27246 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27246#issuecomment-1470006043) happens when a `bitcoin.conf` file in the default datadir (e.g. `$HOME/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`) has a `datadir=/path` line that sets different datadir containing a second `bitcoin.conf` file. Currently the second `bitcoin.conf` file is ignored with no warning.\r\n\r\n- Another way this could happen is if a `-conf=` command line argument points to a configuration file with a `datadir=/path` line and that path contains a `bitcoin.conf` file, which is currently ignored.\r\n\r\nThis change only adds an error message and doesn't change anything about way settings are applied. It also doesn't trigger errors if there are redundant `-datadir` or `-conf` settings pointing at the same configuration file, only if they are pointing at different files and one file is being ignored.",
