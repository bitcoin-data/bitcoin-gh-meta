Unix sockets are not available on all platforms (although they are available even on recent versions of Windows) and support is detected during configure.\r\n\r\nI copied the prefix `unix:` usage from Tor. With this patch built locally you can test with your own filesystem path (example):\r\n\r\n`tor --SocksPort unix:/Users/matthewzipkin/torsocket/x`\r\n\r\n`bitcoind -proxy=unix:/Users/matthewzipkin/torsocket/x`\r\n\r\nFuture work can extend use of unix sockets to the RPC server as attempted in #9979. Since that PR was originally opened and closed, we have updated libevent which has better support for unix sockets and I think that will make this task a bit easier.",
