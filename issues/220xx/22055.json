   "body" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nIts not related to a open issue. But a growing blockchain with \"useless informations\" could be seen as a \"problem\".\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSince every transaction is transparent it would be possible to squash the blockchain regularly.  \r\nBy this i mean merging all transactions in the past to a new initial transaction. Something like a new Genesis block.  \r\nIn this block just wallets with a positive balance would be taken.  \r\nThis way the blockchain would shrink significantly. I could imagine a process similar to the halvening.  \r\nFor example on a monthly/yearly basis.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThere are no alternatives i know of.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nDoing this the first time would take huge amount of time. Usually such a change would be done in a new fork or a new coin.  \r\nI think it would be a huge change and i understand if this is not wanted.  \r\nBut this type of change would be no breaking change (i guess) since the blockchain would still have the same format and everything else works the same.  \r\n  \r\nPS: This is just a idea i had. I never worked on Bitcoin so dont be too mean if u dislike this idea :)\r\n",
