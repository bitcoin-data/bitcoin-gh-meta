   "body" : "Branch and Bound introduced a metric that we call waste. This metric is used as part of bounding the search tree, but it can be generalized to all coin selection solutions, including those with change. As such, this PR introduces the waste metric at a higher level so that we can run both of our coin selection algorithms (BnB and KnapsackSolver) and choose the one which has the least waste. In the event that both find a solution with the same change, we choose the one that spends more inputs.\r\n\r\nAlso this PR sets the long term feerate to 10 sat/vb rather than using the 1008 block estimate. This allows the long term feerate to be the feerate that we switch between consolidating and optimizing for fees. This also removes a bug where the long term feerate would incorrectly be set to the fallback fee. While this doesn't matter prior to this PR, it does have an effect following this. The long term feerate can be configured by the user through a new `-consolidatefeerate` option.",
