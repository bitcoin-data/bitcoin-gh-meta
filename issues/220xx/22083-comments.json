All your settings and directories are default.\r\n\r\nMy bet is the combination Bitcoin Core v0.21.1 + Rosetta + Apple M1 is not compatible between each other. And, definitely, it was not well tested by developers.\r\n\r\nMaybe, a developer who has an access to Apple M1 hardware could reproduce this issue on his hardware, and define the part which is responsible for a crash.\r\n\r\nAs an attempt to get it work, you could try to:\r\n- create an empty `/Users/piialiisa/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` file\r\n- put the only text line `par=1` in it (this will set the number of script verification threads to 1, i.e., no parallelization)\r\n- and run Bitcoin Core again",
