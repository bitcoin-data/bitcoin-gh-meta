It would make it trivial to make it impossible for an attacker to start locking people out of their funds. All that it would take is for an attacker to create a dust spam transaction that sends to a bunch of addresses. If this transaction were at the min relay fee, and if fees were above the minimum, then the transaction could remain in the mempool for a very long time, during which time all of the users whose addresses are in receiving the spam would be unable to send some or all of their funds. Furthermore, this would become another way to fingerprint a user - from this, it would be possible to learn that users are not using Bitcoin Core.",

      "body" : "> Is there a link to know about all the problems associated with spending unconfirmed outputs?\r\n\r\nNot that I know of, but I can list the problems I'm aware of:\r\n\r\n- If the payment to you is conflicted, your re-spend becomes invalid but you still might be legally obligated to pay your receipient\r\n- If the payment to you is RBF'd, your re-spend becomes invalid, requiring you to issue a new payment.  This can be quite an ordeal (you might need to ask for a new invoice and a new exchange rate, you might need to update your accounting records)\r\n- If you issue a new payment, you must be absolutely certain it conflicts with *all* previous payments you issued for that item/service so that a mempool reshuffling or block chain reorg doesn't result in you double paying\r\n- You payment might not be relayed due to mempool ancestor/descendent limits\r\n- All the problems above are multiplied by each additional person spending unconfirmed incoming payments, e.g. if Alice pays Bob who pays Carol who pays Dan, now payment to Dan are broken each time any one of Alice, Bob, or Carol decides to RBF fee bump their transaction, or when Bob's decides to create a large transaction with his change output, or Carol's low feerate transaction gets dropped from the mempool, etc.\r\n\r\n> How can we make the users aware of these things?\r\n\r\nI think that's too much technical detail to put on end users for such a minor issue as spending money they haven't fully received yet.  Even if we could solve all of the above problems with a nice UI, I'd be wary of making it easy for people to spend unconfirmed incoming payments---letting users do that minimizes the essential security difference between unconfirmed transactions and confirmed transactions.  For developers, I think it's ok to allow them to bypass the restriction if we (or someone else) provides documentation.  I think the recently-added exceptions to the PSBT commands is a reasonable way to do that.\r\n\r\n> Confusion in some cases is better than unknowingly using one of inputs selected by algorithm that affects your privacy. People who use coin control for all transactions will never have issues but others who use coin selection algorithm are already confused lot of times about the inputs selected in different transactions.\r\n\r\nHuh?  Most users don't care about what inputs gets selected, so why would they be confused by that?\r\n\r\n> Negative: I am unable to use some of my bitcoin. What can I do to change this? Unlock UTXOs if I really want to use them.\r\n> \r\n> At least I know someone is trying to know more about my wallet and transactions.\r\n\r\nA better approach IMO to making Bitcoin Core users perform extra steps to spend their money would be to get other wallets to use the same safety-first approach of Bitcoin Core to not allowing spending of incoming unconfirmed outputs.\r\n\r\n> There is a **problem** and I am looking for **solutions**. Unfortunately NACKs with no alternative solution do not solve the problem.\r\n\r\nThe only truly effective approach to preventing wallet fingerprinting is to get all wallets to implement a standardized set of behavior.  To do that, I think you want to first identify what the best practices are and then try to get every wallet to implement those best practices.  In the case of incoming unconfirmed outputs, I think the best practice is to not spend them (except for CPFP fee bumping).  Bitcoin Core implements that non-spending behavior, so I think the goal should be to get other wallets to adopt that same behavior.",

In those cases, it may be a good idea to BIP the best practice.\r\n\r\n> Either spend all coins associated with a scriptpubkey in a transaction or none is one of the best practices.\r\n>\r\n> Is Bitcoin Core following it? No\r\n\r\nI think this is a matter of interpretation.  IMO you don't actually have a coin until it's confirmed, so Bitcoin Core's opt-in behavior of avoiding partial spends is following the best practice when you only consider confirmed coins.\r\n\r\n> It has been mentioned lot of times that Bitcoin Core needs more reviewers. What is the use of spending time, doing research, testing something and providing relevant information if it doesn't matter?\r\n\r\nI understand that it's frustrating when your suggestions aren't accepted.  It's also uncomfortable for those of us who are criticizing your idea---we want you to have a good experience contributing to Bitcoin Core and we're sorry when that doesn't happen.  The way to ensure your time hasn't been wasted is to try to understand the concerns raised on this issue so that you can apply them towards future proposals.\r\n\r\nFor example, we currently use avoidpartialspends by default when there's no fee difference between using it and not using it.  If you propose to implement the case where we don't spend from a set of reused scripts when there's an unconfirmed payment to one of those scripts in any case where avoiding that partial spend ensures there's still sufficient funds and when it doesn't increase fees, maybe your idea might find more traction.  That's a lot more work to implement, I expect, but it moves us slightly closer to your goal without producing any adverse effects for the user.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could look into other past suggestions to address problems with avoding partial spends.  E.g., I think there was a suggestion that, once a script had been spent once, any further funds received to that script would be shunted into a sub-wallet so that they wouldn't be mingled with the main wallet's funds.  Users could then run their \"dirty\" funds through a coinjoin once a year (or whatever) before moving them back into their main wallet.\r\n\r\nIn short, I think there's still options available in the solution space if you want to keep trying.  But if you don't want to keep trying, I think that's ok too.  In the seven years I've been contributing to Bitcoin, I've often had to give up on ideas when I realized they were either impractical or too big for me to accomplish.  This has allowed me to focus my time on things I could accomplish (and even, sometimes, do well).",
