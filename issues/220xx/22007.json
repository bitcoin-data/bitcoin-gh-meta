   "body" : "This would allow ad hoc transaction batching. When a wallet transaction is unconfirmed, I'd like to be able to add an additional destination / output. [BIP 125](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki) requires that such a transaction also increases the fee rate.\r\n\r\nOne approach would be to create a new wallet RPC `addoutput, which takes a transaction hash, address, amount and fee rate (difference).\r\n\r\nA better approach imo would be to add a new argument `extra_outputs` to `bumpfee` (and `psbtbumpfee`).  This would have the same format as `outputs` in [send](https://bitcoincore.org/en/doc/0.21.0/rpc/wallet/send/).\r\n\r\nTwo complications come to mind:\r\n1. If the original transaction used `subtract_fee_from_outputs` we don't store that information (see also #11122), so either:\r\n   a) the user has to provide that array again for us to subtract the additional fee correctly; or\r\n   b) the extra fee is paid entirely from change\r\n2. If the previous transaction confirms, rather than the new one, the user has to figure this out and manually craft a new transaction",
