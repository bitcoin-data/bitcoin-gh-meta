   "body" : "Class of second-layers applications interested by the package acceptance API are mostly relying on trustless chain of transactions which are necessarily made of segwit input. As such, most of them are making their internal propagation sanity checks and feerate computations already in weight units (at least I can confirm for Lightning, it's mandatory in the spec to announce `feerate_per_kw` to your counterparty).\r\n\r\nTo reduce odds of bugs in second-layers implementations, such as the one mentioned in #13283, this PR changes the package acceptance size limit from kilo-bytes to weight units.\r\n\r\nE.g an internal Lightning onchain logic with an already-computed package weight of 404_002 (100_000 bytes of regular fields, 4002 bytes of witness fields), dividing by WITNESS_SCALE_FACTOR, obtaining 101_000 virtual bytes, checking against MAX_PACKAGE_SIZE and then wrongly evaluating the package as valid for mempool acceptance.\r\n\r\nIt also matches our max transaction size check already expressed in weight units (`MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT`).",
