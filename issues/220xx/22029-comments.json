Non-blocking suggestion: could skip the rename? :)\r\n\r\nI renamed the directory for seeds in the first commit [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/61). Will seeds still be invalidated? I'm happy to skip the rename if that is not sufficient.\r\n\r\nSeparately, I added some instrumentation and saw 67% of the seeds are not getting more coverage because of an invalid dbl-sha256 checksum - the fuzzer could use a little help. Another 30% because of an invalid message type. I am preparing a patch that uses `ConsumeBool()` to inject a valid checksum half the time. I'll report back if I see meaningfully increased coverage. Do you think that would be a good change, @practicalswift ?",
