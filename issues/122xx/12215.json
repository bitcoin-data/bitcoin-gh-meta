   "body" : "I'm using Raspbian Stretch and just installed the bitcoin to setup full node using following command\r\nsudo apt-get install bitcoin-qt bitcoind\r\n\r\n1. First I was not displayed with start screen to choose location for data directory as mentioned here \r\nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#ubuntu-1610\r\n2. I have mounted FTP drive folder where I want my data directory to be pointed. \r\n3. So I always have to start bitcoin from terminal with datadir option otherwise it starts downloading into default location and I cant download entire blockchain on my pi sdcard.\r\n4. Unfortunately that doesn't work either. it always errors out saying can not obtain lock may be this and that using it.\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\n1. I assume its permission issue, but I can manually create, delete update file in that mounted location so why bitcoin app can not? is there special command it need to start with ? And no there is no other program using it or running that has it locked.\r\n\r\n2. What option is requires it to start with to show data directory location screen at start \r\n",
