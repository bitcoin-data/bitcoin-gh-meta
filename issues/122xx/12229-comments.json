      "body" : "The issue that you hit is that the threadGroup including the scheduler thread got interrupted and shut down prior to the CConnman Stop(), which occurred prior to the GetMainSignals().FlushBackgroundCallbacks(). The only other thing in the same threadGroup, IIRC, are the script check threads, meaning you may have a similar race where running ConnectBlock's, which will fall back to single threaded validation for largely no reason. I do not believe the second issue is a race, as the single thread will do work while waiting for the queue to finish, though previous suggested changes to the queue did not do so, and would have created a subtle race.\r\n\r\nThus, I think the correct fix is to delay interrupting the threadGroup until immediately prior to the FlushBackgroundCallbacks() or FlushStateToDisk() call in Shutdown().",
