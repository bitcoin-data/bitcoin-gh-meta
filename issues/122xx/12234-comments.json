Thanks for helping with translations!\r\n\r\nChanges to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to\r\n[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).\r\n\r\nTranslations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the\r\n[translation process](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.\r\n\r\n**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next\r\npull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.",
