Since everything is segwit now, it seems like there's no way to get a solvable watchonly address anymore.\r\n\r\nEDIT: For other people who are running into this, you can work around it using `importpubkey`. If needed, set `rescan` to `false` and then use `rescanblockchain` to manually rescan to a suitable depth. (Of course, this is more RPC-intensive if you were actually using `importmulti` to import multiple things, rather than just using it for its clever date-based rescan behavior as I was.)",
