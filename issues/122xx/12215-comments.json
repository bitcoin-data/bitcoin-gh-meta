So I changed bitcoin code to look for index folder one level up and problem for index folder was solved\r\n3. But bitcoin still has issues to write blocks in ftp location at the soft link\r\n4. I thought its because linked folder issue.. so I changed code again to accept blockdir as argument to forcefully change block directory but got same issue\r\n\r\ndebug.log ==> Unable to open file ..../blk0000.dat\r\n\r\nAgain.. why its so difficult for bitcoin core application to write at ftp location when I can manually create/delete/update files from within the raspberry.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: why not add settings in config file for index, blocks, chainstate locations",
