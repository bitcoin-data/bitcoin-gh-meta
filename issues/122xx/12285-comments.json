It seems that the problem was rather caused by problems with reading some old-version files than with peer communication.\r\n\r\nAnybody wanting to debug this problem should make a backup of the 0.15.1 data structure because after rewriting the files, the problem is gone. I had the same error appearing after upgrading testnet so backing up testnet might be an easier path.   ",
