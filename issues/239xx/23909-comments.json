As others have mentioned, and as I laid out in the PR description, the benefit is a reduction in the number of dependencies you need to build Bitcoin Core for macOS. In general, if it's possible to simplify a build process with no, or near zero downside (which I certainly think is the case here), then I think it's something we should be doing.\r\n\r\n> it only serves to sabotage derivative projects.\r\n\r\nNot even sure how to respond to this, but I really think you need to get some perspective. What's changing here is outlined in the image below. Remembering that this is a view that's only shown during the install procedure, for a single host, and likely, at most, for the few seconds it takes for a user to drag the app icon over to the folder. Note that the project name is still shown in two other places, so it's not like this is removing the only branding / naming that was present in the DMG. How exactly is anything being sabotaged by this few second view only containing 2 instances of the project name, rather than 3?\r\n\r\n![both](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/863730/147894295-66141d37-2fca-4c86-8b36-0b92ac61afef.png)\r\n\r\n> Not really. You still need those to actually build it.\r\n\r\nNo, you don't. Once the .tiff exists in .git, no one has to build it ever again, and thus doesn't need to have those tools present in their build envinronment. That's basically the point of this PR.\r\n\r\n> Now you're just injecting a pre-compiled TIFF into Guix, essentially reverting it back to where things were with gitian\r\n\r\nComparing the copying of a .tiff into our Guix environment, as the equivalent of reverting back to gitian is absurd.",

The makeup of our Guix build (release packaging) environment is our most important build environment, thus a very special case. I completely disagree with the notion that \"deps matter quite a bit less\" there, in fact, I think the opposite is true. In that environment, every additional dependency (and the dependencies of those dependencies) increases the scope for potential compromise, and/or tool/supply chain related attacks and are just more things we have to potentially maintain / vet / install. So I think any change that reduces the build requirements for that environment, is a good one. In this case, we can drop `imagemagick`, `libtiff`, `librsvg` and `font-tuffy` when performing the macOS cross-compile.\r\n\r\n> The description in the PR said the image was added unmodified. \r\n\r\nApologies, I'll update the PR description to reflect the current change.
