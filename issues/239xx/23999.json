Other sources of information are wiki, stackexchange, reddit, twitter etc. with their own problems\r\n2. There are lot of things related to security which are not documented anywhere or not organized in a way that can be easy to refer\r\n\r\nIt was even discussed in meeting and most of the devs agreed to create a doc with security related information for Bitcoin Core: https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2022-01-06#761399;\r\n\r\nExample of a similar document: https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/safety.md \r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\n~~I have created a doc which has 2 main sections: Users and Developers. 'Users' section is further categorized with p2p, rpc, wallet and other. 'Developers' section has two sections, one for secure programming in C++ and other for finding bugs in open pull requests.~~\r\n\r\nI have created a doc which categories p2p, rpc, wallet and other. \r\n~~'Security' section in developer-notes has two things, one for secure programming in C++ and other for finding bugs in open pull requests.~~\r\n\r\n~~Few links that could help in understanding my perspective to add security section in developer notes:~~\r\n\r\n~~https://www.securecoding.com/blog/finding-and-fixing-c-vulnerabilities/~~\r\n\r\n~~https://bitcoincore.reviews/17639~~\r\n\r\n~~https://youtu.be/i0m0FBD-McY~~\r\n\r\n~~https://youtu.be/gHGMDFm2MVs~~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
