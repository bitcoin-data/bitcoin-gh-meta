   "body" : "### What?\r\n\r\nAdd a new file in /doc directory with security recommendations, known issues and related things. Did not use name `security.md` because of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/SECURITY.md\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n1. Other sources of information are wiki, stackexchange, reddit, twitter etc. with their own problems\r\n2. There are lot of things related to security which are not documented anywhere or not organized in a way that can be easy to refer\r\n\r\nIt was even discussed in meeting and most of the devs agreed to create a doc with security related information for Bitcoin Core: https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2022-01-06#761399;\r\n\r\nExample of a similar document: https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/safety.md \r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nI have created a doc which has 2 main sections: Users and Developers. 'Users' section is further categorized with p2p, rpc, wallet and other. 'Developers' section has two sections, one for secure programming in C++ and other for finding bugs in open pull requests.\r\n\r\nThis document in no way is something final, in fact this is just the initial draft with some information that I could remember right now. I will keep updating this doc as I discover anything new and feel free to suggest changes in either the structure of the doc or information added. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFew links that could help in understanding my perspective to add developers section:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.securecoding.com/blog/finding-and-fixing-c-vulnerabilities/\r\n\r\nhttps://bitcoincore.reviews/17639\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/i0m0FBD-McY\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/gHGMDFm2MVs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
