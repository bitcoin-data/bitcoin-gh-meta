I'm worried that the detection might fail without a stdlib specified (similar to boost here)\n\n@theuni Looking at the output of `brew install qt5 --verbose --build-from-source`, it looks like it is.\n\n```\n   Build type: macx-clang (x86_64, CPU features: cx16 mmx sse sse2 sse3 ssse3)\n   qmake vars: QMAKE_CC = clang QMAKE_CXX = clang++\n   Build options:\n   Configuration: c++11 c++14 c++1z\n   Using C++ standard: c++1z\n```\n\nAssuming their bottles are built the same way.\n",
