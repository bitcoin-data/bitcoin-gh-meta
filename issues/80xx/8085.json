   "body" : "This work creates CConnman. The idea is to begin moving data structures and functionality out of globals in net.h and into an instanced class, in order to avoid side-effects in networking code. Eventually, an (internal) api begins to emerge, and as long as the conditions of that api are met, the inner-workings may be a black box.\n\nFor now (for ease), a single global CConnman is created. Down the road, the instance could be passed around instead. Also, CConnman should be moved out of net.h/net.cpp, but that can be done in a separate move-only-ish step.\n\nA few todos remain here:\n- ~~there are `if(g_connman)`'s everywhere. A few places should assume that a connman is running (or it should be passed around). For example, ProcessMessages.~~\n- ~~GetRelayTx/RelayTransaction are awkward. Where should mapRelay live? Should it be dealt with directly rather than hidden inside of relay functions? (rebased on top of #8082)~~\n- ~~How to deal with CConnman parameters? Continue adding them to Start(), or have it parse the program options itself? (Created CConnman::Options)~~\n- ~~RPC needs a new error for dealing with the \"p2p not enabled\" case.~~\n\nTodos for a follow-up PR:\n- Actually create connman.h/cpp and move the class there.\n- Pass CConnman into QT similar to the wallet\n- ~~Drop StartNode/StopNode and just use CConnman::Stop/Start directly (Need to make sure that MapPort can be moved directly into Init without side-effects)~~\n- Pass CChainParams into CConnman and pass it around\n- ~~Create CConnmanOptions to reduce the verbosity of CConnman::Start()~~\n- Deal with fDiscover/fListen/etc in CConnman\n",
