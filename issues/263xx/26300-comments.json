Since there is a delay before the PR/issue is closed (7 days here), a maintainer could remove the `Stale` tag every 6 months or anyone could write a comment.

Similar to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19876#issuecomment-1073871847\r\n\r\nSome ideas:\r\n\r\n* If there is outstanding feedback, it should be replied to or otherwise addressed\r\n* If the CI fails or the last run is older than 6 months, it might be good to rebase to get a fresh CI run and also update the code context to the latest state to simplify review (obviously only if there hasn't been any ACKs to avoid invalidating them)\r\n\r\n",
