This is enough to cause the program to crash. We also show that if the format string contains the ! special character to enable unicode character scanning, then it is possible to achieve arbitrary code execution in the worst case, or to cause the program to hang and loop (nearly) indefinitely.\r\n\r\n`%w` is only used at one place for wallet_name:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/69b10212ea5370606c7a5aa500a70c36b4cbb58f/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L1046",
