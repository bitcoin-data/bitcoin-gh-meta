This removes the locks in `net_processing`. Between releasing the lock after getting the block index and actually reading, the block can be removed during a prune. This can result in the read failing, so `assert`s are replaced with logging the error. If the file is already open on Windows while it is removed it could cause the pruned file to not be removed, so https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26316 is necessary to make sure this doesn't happen.",
