   "body" : "I'm manually installing Guix on a fresh Ubuntu machine. Will be pushing more documentation fixes to this PR as I run into things.\r\n\r\n1. Bump minimum hash to match time-machine bump in #25099. It's not necessary for the root Guix version to match the time-machine version in our build, because `guix build` will automatically perform an upgrade for the user, but imo it's better to get any build issues (in Guix itself) over with while the user is going though `INSTALL.md`, rather than during their first Guix build (of Bitcoin Core).\r\n2. Recommend mapping a tmpfs to /tmp upfront, rather than in the troubleshooting section\r\n3. Add `guile-gnutls` and `guile-json` to the table of stuff to install (avoids having to find out in the `./configure` phase)\r\n4. Improve systemd doc\r\n5. Workaround OpenSSL v1.1.1l and v1.1.1n test failure (change machine time)\r\n6. Move uninstallation instructions to INSTALL.md, drop unused footnote / links\r\n\r\n\r\n",
