So far I have not gotten any feedback but I think this should be ok to change as the feedback in the original PR that I linked above has not making it sound like a hard requirement to have cumulative values. I will clean up the PR and test it more thoroughly in the next couple of days but I tested it on signet already and should fix the issue there.\r\n\r\nFor the approach to upgrade: my current thinking is that it is probably best to build the new version of the index in a new folder and give the user a notice in the logs that they can delete the old index folder. While many users may have this useless data on their disk for a while because they ignore the logs, it seems like the cleanest approach to me. Of course the old index folder can also be deleted automatically but I am not sure this is desirable. I am thinking of users that may jump between different versions of core, maybe the latest release and master. When switching between versions before and after the upgrade, this approach should produce the least side effects. Worst case I think they delete the old index after the reading of the log message but then when they switch back to an older version they see the old index being rebuilt. But if the new index is built in the same folder, it would be much worse and the index would be corrupted leading to very confusing issues for these users. I am sure something could be done to mitigate that but it seems like much more complex solution that is not absolutely necessary. \r\n\r\nHappy to hear your feedback, especially on the approach to upgrade!",
