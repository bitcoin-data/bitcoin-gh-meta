   "body" : "Potentially fixed https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17161. \r\n\r\nIt seems there's a race in `ReadBlockFromDisk` and `UndoReadFromDisk` where after the block/undo file position is retrieved the actual block/undo file could be removed during prune. This could just cause the read to fail, or it could prevent the file from being removed if the file is already open depending on the platform (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c/remove). This PR uses a shared mutex to lock the removal of files until any reads are completed. This way it doesn't block `cs_main` while reading so `ReadBlockFromDisk` usage can be moved outside of `cs_main` in some cases like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26308.\r\n\r\nThe first commit also updates the function signature of `ReadRawBlockFromDisk` to take a block index instead of the file position, and then the file position is retrieved while locking `cs_main` inside the function. That way it unifies it with `ReadBlockFromDisk` and can be moved outside `cs_main` scope inside `net_processing` in a follow up PR like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26326.\r\n\r\nAlso see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25232.",
