   "body" : "This is a rough draft of what a `GetEffectiveBalance` function on the wallet might look like, along with RPC call and wallet interface.\r\nRelated to #15767\r\n\r\nStill todo and open questions:\r\n\r\n- RPCHelp wording is just a rough draft and needs amending\r\n- Should the result contain additional info such as: fee rate used, num utxos, num excluded utxos etc. (this would better satisfy #15767 too)\r\n- Should confirm target be configurable? Currently fixed to a 3 blocks.\r\n  - In this case the response should likely include the confirm target used to generate the effective value.\r\n- Should this be added to QT wallet? Interface is present. I think it would be nice but don't know much about QT.\r\n- ~Required adding a lot of headers to `receive.cpp` which seems sub-optimal. Perhaps the function belongs somewhere else...~\r\n- Doesn't add a dummy recipient to the tx, so fee calculation is slightly off\r\n- ~Doesn't respect `avoid_reuse`~\r\n- Doesn't respect `watch_only`\r\n- RBF just uses wallet default\r\n",
