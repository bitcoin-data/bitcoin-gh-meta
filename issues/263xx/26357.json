We probably don't need hard coded ICANN domains for peer discovery.  \r\n\r\nI think peer discovery can be done entirely using **BitTorrent**.\r\n\r\nDNS seed was cool as a replacement of the IRC method that previously used for discovery. However, there are thousands of BitTorrent trackers out there today, Bitcoin could ship and update the list of trackers example from https://github.com/ngosang/trackerslist. \r\n\r\nOr, what if everyone who runs Bitcoin Core would actually become a BitTorrent tracker itself, the network would grow significantly very quickly considering users would create networks just by sharing their tracker address with others.
