In this case, we could either present the GUI with this \"estimate\" (3 confirmations seems estimate-ish to me), or there could perhaps be an option/drop-down for user to select which fee style they would like the estimate to use.\r\n\r\nFor an RPC, user could specify the fees they wanted used.\r\n\r\nAnyway, for now I am just working out whether it makes much sense at all, and the best way to architect it (e.g. I started with it in spend.cpp as this made logical sense, but ended up introducing circular dependencies so moved into receive.cpp ...)",
