I can't seem to find the one you created, as there are about 5 trillion messages about RBF.\r\n\r\nAbout the practical impact of this change: My understanding is that 60-byte transactions are still not policy-allowed, because an empty scriptPubKey is nonstandard. The smallest transaction this would allow is a 61-byte transaction with one `nulldata` output. Also, the smallest transaction with a `witness_unknown` output is 64-byte and would thus remain invalid. (Obviously putting the smallest `witness_unknown`, or an `INVALID_SPK_LEN` `nulldata` output in a large enough transaction is already valid today)",

But the reverse isn't true; if this approach is harmful, it's much harder to correct it to a more restrictive approach.\r\n\r\nThis is the strongest argument against this in my view, but it applies similarly, to perhaps a lesser degree, to relaxing it at all. If we're worried that it's going to cause issues, maybe we just take the 22 byte padding hit(or whatever the constant is) or do batching if possible.\r\n\r\nOr this proposal can just sit around for another couple release cycles to gather directed feedback from others including the author of https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-March/016714.html ?\r\n\r\nf.e., unless there is strong argument against it, I'd rather re-litigate the Great Consensus Cleanup to switch to this check instead, or learn why this is wrongheaded",

With the current thinking of V3-style setups, those are going to be non-aggregatable simply due to pinning vectors, but that's not a useful observation for today's network, and perhaps the check can be further relaxed later with a V3 policy upgrade. So this could be two-staged as more information comes in about future policy changes. Maybe batched bumps become safer in the future with more work.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSo to recap, the core debate here is that there are very few known use-cases for a further relaxation and chance for wallet authors to not understand the 64 byte exception, weighed against (imo) the slight degradation in code clarity and documentation. The policy could be further relaxed later in tandem with other updates to the network.\r\n\r\nThis sound correct?",

The proposal could be just as easily changed [...]\r\n\r\nYes, you could change the proposal, but that's the point -- this relay policy change would prevent us from deploying the original proposal and would force us to change it. The conservative approach to making a consensus change is to minimise the things that you limit; the conservative approach to making a relay policy change is to minimise the things that you allow.\r\n\r\n> I could foresee a situation where users would want to prefer ANYONECANPAY|ALL in order to ensure that their funds only go to fees. For that to work with aggregation, everyone would have to sign a tx with the same output. A single OP_RETURN seems like it would be the obvious output script to settle on.\r\n\r\nA scriptPubKey of `6a03464545` (`OP_RETURN \"FEE\"`) would be equally straightforward to settle on, and would generate a 65 byte tx, for a single input and single output, no scriptSig, and after the witness was stripped. Unlike a plain OP_RETURN, it's also something you can actually generate today using `createrawtransaction` or `createpsbt`.\r\n\r\nI could see an argument that it would be better to add a targeted exception to only allow txs to be under 85 bytes after stripping the witness if they have a single output that spends to exactly that scriptPubKey (and, perhaps, where all the tx's signatures are ANYONECANPAY). That way any txs that are trying to burn to fees are strongly encouraged to be able to be aggregated (and aggregating them could perhaps eventually be automated as part of getblocktemplate or atmp).\r\n\r\n@instagibbs \r\n\r\n> This is the strongest argument against this in my view, but it applies similarly, to perhaps a lesser degree, to relaxing it at all.\r\n\r\nThere's a clear argument why relaxing it at all is useful: for burning a keypath spend to fees, it saves about 17% of the transaction size; and further I don't think anyone's raised any concerns about that being problematic. (To be fair, I've only seen it hypothesised that that's a useful thing to do, not any protocols where people are actually burning entire outputs to fees, so perhaps it would be better to leave this unmerged until there is a demonstrated use case. Particularly since this is only making things more efficient, not introducing new functionality)\r\n\r\nThe same isn't true of allowing 60-63 bytes as well as 65+ bytes. That only saves an additional 4%, and does introduce weird special cases that have been objected to. Maybe those objections can be overcome, but just ignoring them with \"I have a light preference for doing it the other way\" isn't a remotely conservative approach to development, especially in areas that impact the possibilities for future consensus changes.",

It seems to me like there's no clear agreement yet over which is better, and I'm not sure it's worth the effort to try to reach a consensus on this either, given that if this were ever championed as a consensus rule we'd need to socialize the idea amongst many more people than those reviewing these PRs.

      "body" : "I think I largely agree with @ajtowns' arguments, but I don't have a strong view.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the essential question is whether requiring transactions to be >64 bytes is a simpler/more logical consensus rule than merely requiring transactions not be exactly 64 bytes. It seems to me like there's no clear agreement yet over which is better, and I'm not sure it's worth the effort to try to reach a consensus on this either, given that if this were ever championed as a consensus rule we'd need to socialize the idea amongst many more people than those reviewing these PRs.  So given that, I think the most reasonable thing to do would be to set the policy to >64 for now, since that is most compatible with either choice in the future (ie we can always relax it further).\r\n\r\n> I could see an argument that it would be better to add a targeted exception to only allow txs to be under 85 bytes after stripping the witness if they have a single output that spends to exactly that scriptPubKey (and, perhaps, where all the tx's signatures are ANYONECANPAY). That way any txs that are trying to burn to fees are strongly encouraged to be able to be aggregated (and aggregating them could perhaps eventually be automated as part of getblocktemplate or atmp).\r\n\r\nThis seems like a pretty good idea to me, too.  I don't think there's a compelling reason for transactions under 82 bytes (ignoring witness) to be permitted if they are not for this use case, is there? In general I think it's better to relax these kinds of things in a targeted way to make sure we don't inadvertently introduce DoS vectors or other unadvisable network behavior.",
