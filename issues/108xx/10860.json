It's possible unknown rules are in effect_\r\n\r\nI guess the unknown version bit triggering this warning is bit 4 (bip91) that got over 50% signalling at that point.\r\n\r\n### What I would expect / suggest\r\nI would suggest to include the unknown version bit(s) in the message, so users are assured about exactly what is unknown. \r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n_Warning: Unknown block versions (version bit x) being mined! It's possible unknown rules are in effect_\r\n_Warning: Unknown block versions (version bits x,y,z) being mined! It's possible unknown rules are in effect_\r\n\r\nI think that would not do harm to users that do not know anything about version bits, but those who have at least heard something about that before, can read what bits are unknown and maybe search in the internet for more information.",
