   "body" : "I've created the `seed.bitcoin.wiz.biz` DNS seed for the benefit of the Bitcoin community, and will operate it in accordance with the [Bitcoin DNS seed operator policy](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/dnsseed-policy.md). Since this is my first PR to the Bitcoin Core project, I also ACK the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n\r\nThe data for this DNS seed is generated using redundant instances of TheBlueMatt's [dnsseed-rust implementation](https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/dnsseed-rust), which connects to all discoverable Bitcoin nodes to verify their capabilities and speed, and utilizes the full AS-MAP data from my network's BGP tables to select Bitcoin nodes which are fairly distributed across different networks.\r\n\r\nAs for my qualifications, I currently operate Bitcoin nodes for the [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/) open-source block explorer project (mempool) and the [Bisq Network](https://bisq.network/) open-source P2P trading community (bisq-network). I have 20 years experience as a network engineer, and all of [my Bitcoin nodes](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/?q=AS54415) are hosted on [my own network](https://ipinfo.io/AS54415) across multiple datacenters. For personal references, the current Bitcoin DNS seed operators Emzy and TheBlueMatt can probably vouch for me.\r\n\r\nThe DNS responses served from this instance are currently served with a TTL of 60 seconds, and the DNS resolvers do not log queries from users. Any inquiries related to the operation of this DNS seed can be sent to <noc@wiz.biz>.\r\n\r\nHere is a rough diagram of the `seed.bitcoin.wiz.biz` DNS seed architecture:\r\n\r\n![seed bitcoin wiz biz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/232186/84641969-cb2c6300-af36-11ea-9e4c-392fe39f5f08.png)",
