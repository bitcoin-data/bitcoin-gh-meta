Now we check whether the address belongs to the wallet before fetching the pubkey info.\r\n\r\nSpecifically the P2PKH address for a `pk()` descriptor is not considered watchonly. Because of the refactor, an extra call to `IsMine` is done before getting a `SolvingProvider` that it can use to get the pubkey and key origin. Because the P2PKH is not watchonly or spendable, `IsMine` returns `ISMINE::NO`, no `SolvingProvider` is returned so there is no access to the pubkey information.\r\n\r\nIf you import the address as watchonly, then `getaddressinfo` works as it does previously.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that this is worth fixing as `pk()` doesn't have an address so `getaddressinfo` really shouldn't work for the p2pkh address.",

This would probably require a new RPC call, something like `derivescript`?",
