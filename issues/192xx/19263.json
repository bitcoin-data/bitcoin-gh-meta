But maybe this is non-trivial enough to go to a second PR. I'm volunteering to open a PR after I digged through all the stuff now.\r\n\r\n[comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19228#issuecomment-642352251):\r\n> @real-or-random Thanks for pointing that out. I added a commit to rename privkey to seckey in key.cpp (as a scripted diff). I've left the DER parsing code be for now, as it seems unclear what changes to address where.\r\n\r\n[comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19228#issuecomment-643406092):\r\n> >  I've left the DER parsing code be for now, as it seems unclear what changes to address where.\r\n\r\n> Ok, let's do this in a different PR.",
