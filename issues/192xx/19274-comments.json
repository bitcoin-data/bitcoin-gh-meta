      "body" : "When performing a re-index, Bitcoin stops loading block files where it will begin to sync with network.  And still spends time reindexing each block file that I already have downloaded.  Example:\r\nDuring a re-index Bitcoin 1st reindexes all block files.  There is a confirmation message, Loaded x blocks from external file in x ms.  In my last -reindex pass at block file 865, I stopped seeing those confirmations.  And yet, bitcoin will continue to look at each file down to 2108, which is the last block file I have downloaded.  Then it begins to updateTip starting from the beginning blocks.  When it gets to file 865, it stops updateTip, and begins to re-download blocks from the network.  \r\n\r\nIdeally, Bitcoin would see all my local blocks, and only download if a block in the middle is not complete.  \r\nCheck local for block, if error, request network for download, check next local block.  \r\n\r\nInstead of, check local for block, error, download rest of blocks from network.  Or at least stop reindexing if it's going to ignore all those other blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2020-06-22T14:05:20Z Reindexing block file blk00862.dat...\r\n2020-06-22T14:05:26Z Loaded 112 blocks from external file in 6682ms\r\n2020-06-22T14:05:26Z Reindexing block file blk00863.dat...\r\n2020-06-22T14:05:34Z Loaded 146 blocks from external file in 7456ms\r\n2020-06-22T14:05:34Z Reindexing block file blk00864.dat...\r\n2020-06-22T14:05:40Z Loaded 119 blocks from external file in 6144ms\r\n2020-06-22T14:05:40Z Reindexing block file blk00865.dat...\r\n2020-06-22T14:05:45Z Reindexing block file blk00866.dat...\r\n2020-06-22T14:05:50Z Reindexing block file blk00867.dat...\r\n",
