If you read the sentence that follows the sentence that mentions \"experimental\", you will notice that there is no authority in Bitcoin. Thus there is no one to decide whether it is experimental or not anyway.\r\n\r\nI can see an argument to remove the whole section, as it is not the primary goal of the Bitcoin Core software to educate users about Bitcoin. I'd expect users to already know about Bitcoin once they discover Bitcoin Core. Maybe it can be replaced by something along the lines of the first section of https://bitcoincore.org/en/about/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
