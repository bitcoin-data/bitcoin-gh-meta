(Unrelated, this may already happen on current master, as the CPU scheduler is free to put any thread to sleep just \"for fun\" if it wants to.)\r\nI don't think the changes here may decrease average performance (average throughput / the rate at which MaybeSendFeeFilter is called), though? If there are multiple thread that are competing for a lock in a loop with a short time releasing the lock, at any time at most one thread can hold the lock. Assuming a round robin scheduler to hand out the lock to the threads asking for it, I couldn't come up with an example where the average performance is consistently worse with the patch here, but maybe I am missing something?",
