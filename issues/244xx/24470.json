   "body" : "Add more `fs::path` `operator/` and `operator+` overloads to prevent unsafe string->path conversions on Windows that would cause strings to be decoded according to the current Windows locale & code page instead of the correct string encoding.\r\n\r\nUpdate application code to deal with loss of implicit string->path conversions by calling `fs::u8path` or `fs::PathFromString` explicitly, or by just changing variable types from `std::string` to `fs::path` to avoid conversions altogether, or make them happen earlier.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, there's no change in behavior either (1) because strings only contained ASCII characters and would be decoded the same regardless of what encoding was used, or (2) because of the 1:1 mapping between paths and strings using the `PathToString` and `PathFromString` functions.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this PR was just that I was experimenting with #24469 and noticed that operations like `fs::path / std::string` were allowed, and I thought it would be better not to allow them.",
