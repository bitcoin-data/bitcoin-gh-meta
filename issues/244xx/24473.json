Long wait times.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion/request is that this source code is changed such that these big look-up tables are read from disk instead of dumped into c and h files.\r\n\r\nThis would reduce the source files considerably and would solve analysis problems. Right now only way to solve analysis problems is to delete this particular folder.",
