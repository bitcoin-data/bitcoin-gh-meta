(If there's a way to ask `listunspent` and `listtransactions` to ignore the mempool, I'm not aware of it).\r\n\r\nIt's the wallet that would have to ignore the mempool, I think that could be done. A wallet could be loaded but be \"disconnected\" from the mempool and the chain. In this case, the wallet RPC's should return the latest block processed by the wallet. However, I think the wallet should be \"readonly\" (like watchonly) and all spend calls should fail. The GUI would have to be aware of this as well.\r\n\r\nI understand leases/locks can simplify sync on the client-side. However, I don't think it's that great because:\r\n - if bitcoind is shared then one client can block the others\r\n - if a client crashes its locks/leases could be dangling resulting in an unusable bitcoind\r\n - the client would still have to handle re-sync after some time and/or some notifications, ideally not from scratch\r\n\r\nThe following are what I consider good tips for sync methods:\r\n - be idempotent, re-processing the same data (block/tx/notification) should not result in more changes in the client state, this helps incremental syncs\r\n - listen for zmq notifications on startup and use them to increment or invalidate some client state\r\n - batch process, for instance, avoid listing all transactions",
