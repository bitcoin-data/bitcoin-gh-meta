This opens the flood-gates to many more.\n\nTo solve this more generally I plan on working on a cute little extension RFC to the [JSONRPC 2.0 spec](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification). See discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7783#issuecomment-239442267 .\n\nThis will add a simple form of (in-batch) promise pipelining to JSON-RPC batching, which will allow doing this kind of composition in a more flexible way. Eg `ext_store` and `ext_load` below:\n\n``` javascript\n[\n{\n    \"version\": \"x.x\",\n    \"method\": \"getblockhash\",\n    \"id\": 0,\n    \"params\": [\"123456\"],\n    \"ext_store\": True   // Store the result of this request for later use\n},\n{\n    \"version\": \"x.x\",\n    \"method\": \"getblock\",\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"params\": [\n        null // Placeholder for argument 0, will be replaced by ext_load below\n    ],\n    \"ext_load\": [\n        {\n            \"src\": [0, \"result\"],  // Load the output of request id 0, [\"result\"]\n            \"dst\": [0]             // into into params[0]\n        }\n    ],\n}\n]\n```\n\nThe effect of which will be:\n\n``` javascript\ntmp0 = getblockhash(123456);\ntmp1 = getblock(tmp0);\n```\n\nIn contrast to simple nesting of calls, which would be the alternative extension, this also allows for more complex composition, and re-use of values.\n\nReturning:\n\n``` javascript\n[\n{\n    \"id\": 0,\n    \"error\": null,\n    \"result\": \"0000000000002917ed80650c6174aac8dfc46f5fe36480aaef682ff6cd83c3ca\"\n},\n{\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"error\": null,\n    \"result\": {\n        \"hash\": ...,\n        \"confirmations\": ...,\n        ...\n    }\n}\n]\n```\n",

In any case what use-case to you have that requires shaving a few milliseconds from a getblock call? Have you benchmarked? I'm fairly sure most of the bottleneck is reading and parsing the block and formatting JSON [hopefully done without holding the cs_main lock] - if the latter, have you looked at the REST interface?\n\nEdit: If you need _a lot_ of getblock calls you can pipeline without any RPC extensions: in the first batch, run getblockhash on block number 0..X - this is what our linearize.py script does too. In the second batch you can then request all the actual block data using `getblock`.\n\n> I think it's a security risk to support getblock by height directly. People shouldn't use height to refer to specific blocks, since reorgs can change the block at a given height.\n\nInteresting point. It's safe for old blocks, but for working at the tip, using it probably means you're not handling reorgs properly.\n",
