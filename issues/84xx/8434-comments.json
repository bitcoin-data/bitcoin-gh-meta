I do think that ZeroTier would benefit greatly from providing some sort of built-in firewall, especially with public networks like Earth. Encouraging people to connect to Earth isn't something I would currently do unless they could specify prior to connection which ports they would like shared/accessible, which in the case of bitcoin is port 8333.\n",

      "body" : "I've used zerotier for years as an easy to set up L2 VPN, and it really is very nice. For zerotier earth though, it might be best to support it by calling a generic [`RunCommandParseJSON` hook](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a9d1b40d53ec417eefbe767aa66701ef8e1801d5/src/util/system.h#L111-L118). Similar to how the signer uses a simple command line protocol to enumerate devices and sign transactions, network code could use a simple command line protocol to start/stop accepting connections and get address information. Then zerotier or other network support could be added with external scripts instead of c++ code that needs to be reviewed and maintained here.\r\n\r\nI could also imagine a `RunCommandParseJSON` networking hook being useful for simulations and testing.",
