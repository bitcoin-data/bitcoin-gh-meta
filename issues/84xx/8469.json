   "body" : "This pull request is a proof of concept for introducting [property based testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck) into Bitcoin Core\n\n> In QuickCheck the programmer writes assertions about logical properties that a function should fulfill. Then QuickCheck attempts to generate a test case that falsifies these assertions. Once such a test case is found, QuickCheck tries to reduce it to a minimal failing subset by removing or simplifying input data that are not needed to make the test fail.\n\nThis has been very useful for a Bitcoin library I've been working on and thought it would be worthwhile to develop a POC for Bitcoin Core. The property based library I am using for C++ is called [rapidcheck](https://github.com/emil-e/rapidcheck). Here are the [docs](https://github.com/emil-e/rapidcheck/tree/master/doc). \n\nThis pull request currently contains [two properties](https://github.com/Christewart/bitcoin/blob/rapidcheck/src/test/key_properties.cpp#L34-L46), one testing `CKey` generation and the other testing serialization symmetry for `CKey` and `CBitcoinSecret`. These are rather trivial properties, but useful for illustrating the power of property based testing if there was a bug inside of Core.\n\nI want to solicit some feedback from developers if this is something that would actually be merged into Core. Eventually we could have a large library of [generators](https://github.com/emil-e/rapidcheck/blob/master/doc/generators.md) that would allow us to quickly prototype, test, and reason about the behavior of new code added to Core. Here is an example of a [library of generators](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s-core/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/bitcoins/core/gen/TransactionGenerators.scala#L70-L117) (in Scala) that could give you a little more of an idea of what I am talking about. \n\nThoughts?\n",
