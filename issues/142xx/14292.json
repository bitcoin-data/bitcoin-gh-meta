The field\r\n       <userpw> comes in the format: <USERNAME>:<SALT>$<HASH>. A\r\n       canonical python script is included in share/rpcuser. The client\r\n       then connects normally using the\r\n       rpcuser=<USERNAME>/rpcpassword=<PASSWORD> pair of arguments. This\r\n       option can be specified multiple times\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nv0.16.3, via tarball\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nUbuntu 18.04.1 LTS\r\n\r\nThis could be resolved by including the script in the tarball's `share` directory, so that is accessible to users. Being a small script, this would not require much overhead. Alternatively, another method could be given to allow the user to generate salted password hashes, perhaps as a command line executable.\r\n\r\ncc @harding ",
