Code refactoring is defined as the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behaviour. \r\n2. Triggering undefined behaviour is defined as executing computer code whose behaviour is not prescribed by the language specification to which the code adheres, for the current state of the program.\r\n\r\nSince undefined behaviour is a superset of external behaviour it follows that a PR fixing UB cannot be considered refactoring, no? :-)\r\n\r\nI suggest labelling all UB fixes with the bug label so that they get the attention they deserve.",

      "body" : "I am not familiar with the code base so take this with a grain of salt. I was curious about the change in validation.cpp though, and I thought another pair of eyes cannot hurt. From my observation:\r\n1. A search of the repo indicates nBlocksTotal is only referenced in validation.cpp.\r\n2. nBlocksTotal is only used in 2 functions, ConnectBlock and ConnectTip.\r\n3. nBlocksTotal is initialized to 0, is incremented on another line of code, and the other 11 instances it is a divisor in a LogPrint.\r\n4. The change made causes the nBlocksTotal counter to include the genesis block, so it will always be one higher than prior to this change. Since it is only used in logging statements, this should not affect functionality at all.\r\n5. The logging statements in ConnectBlock would not have been vulnerable to this division by zero risk as they would not have been executed for the genesis block due to the return statement for that special case.\r\n6. The logging statements in ConnectTip might be affected by division by zero as ConnectTip is called by ActivateBestChain, which is called from several places in the code base. I didn't study it further to see if it would ever be called prior to ConnectBlock() for the second time, but given the several instances of calling it sprinkled throughout the code base, it is a good idea to protect against division by zero. [as an aside, would division by zero in a logging statement terminate the process and kill the node? although in this particular example, it'd happen immediately after validating just the first couple of blocks so not really that critical]\r\n\r\nThis change appears worthwhile and doesn't seem harmful to me.",

      "body" : "@sipa In C++11, while allowing all possible implementations and ignoring language annexes, assuming an \"int\" can represent a value outside of [-32768, 32767] is undefined behaviour.  Do you intend to accept PRs going through the codebase to fix all code relative to that?\r\n\r\nWith these change the codebase is still not unconditionally correct or safe on some hypothetical system which has arbitrary non-IEEE-754-like semantics (e.g. go look at the fee estimator calculations).  Nor do I think it's plausible to make it so without just eliminating the floating point entirely.  (and, as an aside, if we wanted to limit the codebase to the language without optional appendexes like annex f then we'd have to eliminate floating point regardless)\r\n\r\nThis is a silence-a-tool make-work change-- of low but non-zero value-- being disguised as a fix of a serious and concerning problem.   The result of handling it that way is that it both gets inadequate review and diverts attention from more useful activities, causing an increased risk of actual bugs.",

I support improvements in that regard, but discussions like this only piss people off.\r\n\r\nWe're writing software for real systems, and even have the luxury of rather tight control over what architectures are supported. There are plenty of assumptions made that restrict correct operation to certain systems. A certain subset of those also mean that things detected by ubsan and others are spurious.\r\n\r\nSorry, but claiming that a fix is needed \"because UB in C++\" is crying wolf. Especially when not taking the reality into account, it is overly dramatic, distracts from far more important issues, and won't get you much goodwill from reviewers.\r\n\r\nI think this is a meaningful code quality improvement, but you just justify it as \"this lets us remove the silencing of divide-by-zero in ubsan, making it a more powerful check for future issues, and it's just a small change\" - not as \"UB! Must fix at all costs\", and then turn it into an endless semantics discussion.\r\n\r\n",
