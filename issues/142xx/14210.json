   "body" : "Our python functional testing framework is pretty limited for what kinds of p2p behaviors we can test.  Basically, we can currently only make manual connections between bitcoind nodes (using the `addnode` rpc), which are treated differently in our code than outbound peers selected using addrman.\r\n\r\nWhile we do have some unit-testing coverage of some of the components (like addrman, and parts of net_processing), I don't believe we currently are able to test the overall logic of how bitcoind uses those components (I recall this coming up when working on #11560, as a specific example).\r\n\r\nAnyway I am just mentioning this here as a potential project idea, as this is a material gap in our testing that I think would be valuable to work towards improving, and I wasn't sure how well known this is.",
