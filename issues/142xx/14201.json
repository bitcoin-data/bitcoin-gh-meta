Use assertions instead.\r\n\r\nNote to reviewers:\r\n* Some of these redundant checks might be indications of logical bugs in the existing code. If so they should be solved separately. Let me know if you spot such cases.\r\n* Although these conditions are known to be true in some cases we might have good reasons for doing a redundant check for documentation purposes or other reasons. Let me know if you think so.\r\n* Some of the assertions might be overkill since the preceding code trivially implies what we assert. The `fMaster` is such a case.\r\n\r\nFeedback welcome :-)",
