   "body" : "I am currently running Bitcoin Core 16.3 on a 64 bit Windows 10 machine.\r\n\r\nIt is running as a \"full node\" but limited to 64 connections.\r\n\r\nI thought it might be fun to use a Rasberry Pi 3 that I am not otherwise using as a full node, both as a way of learning more about using the Pi and improving my Linux skills. \r\n\r\nThe idea of downloading the nearly 200GB of blockchain to it seems like a terrible waste of bandwidth if I can use the data from the Windows machine.\r\n\r\nIf I install whatever necessary OS and wallet to the Pi, then run it once to create a new wallet, then close the wallet - will I be able to copy across the \"blocks\", \"chainstate\" & \"database\" folders (or just whatever folder/s are necessary, then open the wallet again and have it almost synced?\r\n\r\nAnother way to put this question: is the Bitcoin blockchain data stored differently between operating systems? I know the folder/s will be in different locations in a linux file structure but will the actual data be the same, and work between different software versions of Bitcoin Core?\r\n\r\nI know this isn't technically an \"issue\" as such but more of a query, so if I am posting in the wrong place I apologise - please let me know where I should ask.",
