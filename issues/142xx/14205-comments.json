There are currently ~550 open issues on this project. Contributor and reviewer time spent on getting that number down would be more valuable than yet more refactor PRs.\r\n\r\nCode quality is obviously important. At the same time there's a general feeling that the continual code churn and PR traffic that results from all these refactor PRs is slowing down the project and deflecting reviewer/maintainer focus from more important issues.",
