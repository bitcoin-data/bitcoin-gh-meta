   "body" : "@SergioDemianLerner described a potential attack vector by exploiting the way how `vfExec` is handled in script. Since the `vfExec` vector is scanned once for every opcode, a specially crafted script could scan up to 979K items, and it may take a couple seconds to validate a block packed with such scripts. Read more: https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2017/04/17/new-quadratic-delays-in-bitcoin-scripts/\r\n\r\nThe article suggested an O(1) algorithm to fix the problem. I'm trying to fix in a different way. Although it is not the optimal solution, the 5-line patch is very easy to review, and it can reduce the worst case from 979k to about 5k items to be scanned, a 99.49% reduction.\r\n\r\nTo make review easier, I'll make inline comments\r\n\r\nEDIT: a regular block full of CHECKSIG might also take seconds to validate, so this consensus code fix may not be necessary. But anyway, review and comments are welcomed.",
