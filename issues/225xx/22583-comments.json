For people with ordinary text editors, it may be non-obvious but then again everybody writes tests somehow today and my guess is that they follow some convention already. And even if everything fails and somebody will write `assert_equal` \"wrong\", it's not an end of the world (for me :-))\r\n\r\nThanks for the comment!\r\n\r\nEdit: The reason I filed this issue is that I got burned by this once and it took me more time to understand something. So there is some real world motivation.",
