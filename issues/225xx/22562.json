   "body" : "This brings the entirety of netaddress.h into styling compliance\r\nwith regard to the indentation of `public`/`private`/`protected`\r\nclass blocks, per the styling guidelines.\r\n\r\nAs outlined in the developer documentation, there should be\r\nno indentation for `public`/`private`/`protected` class blocks,\r\nand this file currently has a \"mixed-usage\" of indentation vs\r\nnon-indentation in this regard. This PR serves to bring the file\r\ninto uniform compliance with the standing guidelines, which\r\nshould prevent/ease further confusion.\r\n\r\nThis is a whitespace-only PR, as can be verified by enabling\r\nthe \"Hide whitespace changes\" option in GitHub's WebUI;\r\nnet 0/0 additions/deletions.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nI know blanket refactors such as this are generally\r\ndiscouraged, but seeing as there is little current activity with\r\nthis file at the moment, and that it is bringing it into styling\r\ncompliance, I feel it is appropriate/justified if for nothing else\r\nthan squashing a discrepancy in the existing code styling\r\nthat is in direct contradiction to the stated guidelines.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: I have specifically ignored the pointer/reference side portion\r\nof clang-format here specifically to make this a whitespace-only\r\nchange-set. As such, anyone running the `clang-format-diff.py`\r\nscript manually against this commit will see further changes that\r\nare intentionally omitted here, but could be added if deemed\r\nappropriate.\r\n",
