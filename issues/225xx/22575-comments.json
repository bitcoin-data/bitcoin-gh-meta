Combined with #19762 this would let us safely provide RPC methods accepting only a small number of positional arguments, but a large number of named options, so there is no need for command line users to use json object syntax, but also no risk of getting options confused by trying to pass them by position. This should probably be simple to implement as RPCHelpMan extension after #19762 and would be equivalent to python's keyword-only argument feature `def fun(arg1, arg2, *, option1, option2)` https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/#rationale",
