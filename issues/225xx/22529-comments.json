Maybe they have already been answered somewhere.\r\n\r\n1. It's quite hard to verify on github that `chainparams_seed_main` matches `nodes_main.txt`. Is there an easy way for the reviewers to do this?\r\n\r\n2. Is there any way to verify that the list of peers being added are peers worth adding? I think in order to be included in the core list, they must somehow be superior to peers that are being advertised normally via the network from seed nodes. Just a few criteria I can think of:\r\n\r\n- Uptime\r\n- First-seen time\r\n- Services running\r\n- How fast can the node serve blocks\r\n- Forwarding transactions\r\n- Possible suspicious behavior, eg. only advertises a small set of nodes\r\n- Recent or old version of core, or some other implementation\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nThank you!",
