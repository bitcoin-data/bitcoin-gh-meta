This could lead to collision when it is not real one. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\nCheck should be made to confirm if `pinfo` is empty while checking `fInsert`. \r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\nSome `addrman_new_collisions` tests failed \r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\nUbuntu 20\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nMaster\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n500GB, Linux\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue? What is your operating system and its version? If Linux, what is your desktop environment and graphical shell? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
