   "body" : "\r\n**Describe the issue**\r\nCore can not check past blocks correctly\r\n\r\n**What behavior did you expect?**\r\nExpected setting checkblocks=0, checklevel=6, and assumevalid=0 to result in verification that the chain is valid. And that it would take nigh upon forever. It doesnât. It poops out in about 12 hours. \r\n\r\n**What was the actual behavior** \r\nDebug.log highlights:\r\n(Note: Block height at time of message was 693086)\r\ninit message: Verifying blocksâ¦\r\nVerifying last 693086 blocks at level 4\r\n[0%]â¦ [10%]â¦ [20%]â¦ [30%]â¦ [40%]â¦ERROR: VerifyDB(): *** coin database inconsistencies found (last 601365 blocks, 142571 good transactions before that)\r\n\r\nCorrupted block database detected.\r\n\r\n**How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so?**\r\n100% reproducible. To reproduce, just try rechecking the chain. I donât know the fastest way to do this, in fact, Iâm not even entirely sure how many checklevels there even are but I read 6 on stack exchangeâ¦anyhow, just add this to bitcoin.conf and restart node:\r\n\r\nassumevalid=0\r\ncheckblocks=0\r\nchecklevel=6\r\n\r\n**What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)?**\r\n0.21.1.0; self compiled. I got the code two different t ways: over Internet using git at the command line and from the friendly lizards working for blockstream in space via satellite using blocksat-cli.\r\n\r\n**What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)?**\r\nIâve checked two intel architecture nodes I have running. Both are little intel NUCs.\r\nUbuntu 20.04 Lts/2.6 ghz intel i7 underclocked at 2.4 GHz max just in case/16 and 32 GB RAM at conservative BIOS settings/NVME SSD (tried it on one node with a single Samsung 970 evo plus formatted ext4 filesystem and another with 2 Samsung 980 NVME in raid 1 configurationâ¦also ext4)\r\n\r\n**What is your operating system and its version? If Linux, what is your desktop environment and graphical shell?**\r\nWhatever is default for Ubuntu \r\n\r\n**Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process.**\r\nSomeone far smarter than me can reproduce this too (dflate)\r\n\r\nSomehow relates to thisâ¦see explorers disagreeing (via dflate)\r\n\r\nhttps://blockstream.info/tx/d5d27987d2a3dfc724e359870c6644b40e497bdc0589a033220fe15429d88599?expand\r\n\r\nhttps://explorer.bitcoin.com/btc/tx/d5d27987d2a3dfc724e359870c6644b40e497bdc0589a033220fe15429d88599\r\n\r\n\r\nOtherwise, not yet. I keep my node off the internet, because, you know, satellite and stuffâ¦but Iâve typed out by hand what seems relevant above. \r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
