   "body" : "~This PR is based on #22383, which should be reviewed first~ (merged by now).\r\n\r\nIn [yesterday's PR review club session to PR 22383](https://bitcoincore.reviews/22383), the idea of moving the function `GetTransaction(...)` from src/validation.cpp to src/node/transaction.cpp came up. With this, the circular dependency \"index/txindex -> validation -> index/txindex\" is removed (see change in `lint-circular-dependencies.sh`). Thanks to jnewbery for suggesting and to sipa for providing historical background.\r\n\r\nRelevant IRC log:\r\n```\r\n17:52 <jnewbery> Was anyone surprised that GetTransaction() is in validation.cpp? It seems to me that node/transaction.cpp would be a more appropriate place for it.\r\n17:53 <raj_> jnewbery, +1\r\n17:53 <stickies-v> agreed!\r\n17:54 <glozow> jnewbery ya\r\n17:54 <jnewbery> seems weird that validation would call into txindex. I wonder if we remove this function, then validation would no longer need to #include txindex\r\n17:54 <sipa> GetTransaction predates node/transaction.cpp, and even the generic index framework itself :)\r\n17:55 <sipa> (before 0.8, validation itself used the txindex)\r\n17:55 <jnewbery> (and GetTransaction() seems like a natural sibling to BroadcastTransaction(), which is already in node/transaction.cpp)\r\n17:55 <jnewbery> sipa: right, this is not meant as a criticism of course. Just wondering if we can organize things a bit more rationally now that we have better separation between things.\r\n17:55 <sipa> jnewbery: sure, just providing background\r\n17:56 <sipa> seems very reasonable to move it elsewhere now\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe commit should be trivial to review with `--color-moved`.",
