   "body" : "Backport of #22387.\r\n\r\nThe rate at which IP addresses are rumoured (through ADDR and ADDRV2 messages) on the network seems to vary from 0 for some non-participating nodes, to 0.005-0.025 addr/s for recent Bitcoin Core nodes. However, the current codebase will happily accept and process an effectively unbounded rate from attackers. There are measures to limit the influence attackers can have on the addrman database (bucket restrictions based on source IPs), but still - there is no need to permit them to feed us addresses at a rate that's orders of magnitude larger than what is common on the network today, especially as it will cause us to spam our peers too.\r\n    \r\nThis PR implements a [token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) based rate limiter, allowing an average of 0.1 addr/s per connection, with bursts up to 1000 addresses at once. Whitelisted peers as well as responses to GETADDR requests are exempt from the limit. New connections start with 1 token, so as to not interfere with the common practice of peers' self-announcement.\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of the `Peer` struct in 0.21, the relevant fields have been added to `CNodeState` instead, necessitating additional locks, and slightly different structure to avoid too much `cs_main` grabbing. The last test-improving commit has also been dropped, as the code has changed too much. Most of the behavior is still tested however, just not the part that compares with RPC statistics.\r\n",
