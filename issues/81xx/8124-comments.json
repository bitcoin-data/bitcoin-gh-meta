OP_RETURN only takes up block space (it isn't expensive to verify, and doesn't create UTXO bloat); something that is far under-priced.  If transactions fees are increased to 50c because people are writing messages in the blockchain with OP_RETURN, that would not bother me; nor I suspect, the miners that would get the extra fees.\n\nI think that it would increase the utility of Bitcoin.\n",

Users preferring to make OP_RETURN outputs will only compete with other uses of the block chain space.\n\nConsidering that there always be enough spam to fill the remaining space of any block. I think that spam consisting of OP_RETURN is far preferable to junk transactions that are expensive to verify and create UTXO bloat.\n\nSuggesting that blocks will be _more_ full because of the option to add custom OP_RETURN outputs to transactions is somewhat unreasonable.  People who make them quite well could have far more 'valid purposes' than those who spam the network to create false evidence that the block size needs to increase.\n",
