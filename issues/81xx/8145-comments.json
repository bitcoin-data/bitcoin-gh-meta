I'd still like to document how to get cookie auth working or note not to use cookie auth in the tor documentation.\n\n@laanwj, you mention a more appropriate solution - an alternative to adding the bitcoind user to the tor group.  Is that to create a \"tor-cookie\" group, add both users to that group, and chown the cookie file?  As far as I'm aware, that cookie is destroyed and generated programmatically and I'm not sure how to set appropriate permissions that will persist.\n",
