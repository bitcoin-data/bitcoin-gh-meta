   "body" : "I wrote this as a reimplementation for #7942 but forgot to actually push it. The merged version of that PR is, as @gmaxwell brought up, prone to lock inversion. It actually has an inversion of cs_main/cs_filter; the conflicting locks are all taken in the same thread, but it's not good practice.\n\nThis uses a new mutex for the two Misbehavior()-related fields of CNodeState, and as an additional lock for mapNodeState. No other locks except addrman's (which is fully encapsulated) are taken while cs_misbehavior is held.\n\nAlso, tacked on the fix for the redundant variable from #7942 pointed out by @sipa.\n",
