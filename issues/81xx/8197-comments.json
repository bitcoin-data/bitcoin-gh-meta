Haven't run this but, going off my recollection of Gitian builds (haven't done one in awhile), all the stuff built in a Gitian container is self-contained and built away from the normal directory structure. So, I don't think this patch is necessary. Nice thought, though, and I could be totally wrong. :)\n",

What I meant with my original comment was that I was under the impression that the generated file wouldn't be picked up in the original directory, and that .gitignore didn't have to be updated. (Obviously, .gitignore and Gitian are unrelated. I didn't mean to imply that.) I was wrong, though. C'est la vie. :)\n",
