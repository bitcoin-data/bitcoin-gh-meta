How are casts of primitive types safer using C++ syntax?\n> \n> I know that pointer casts are safer using C++ syntax and as they are the dangerous kind of casting.\n\nPerhaps I mis-indicated that I was referring only to int style casts,  the above was a blanket opinion.\n\nIn respect to: \n\n> I agree with using C++ syntax when casting from const to non const pointers, or one kind of pointer to another, but I don't agree doing so for all cases where primitive types are converted.\n\nI think this is a good compromise.\nThat said, IMHO, primitive conversions can often [but certainly not always] be an indication that the underlying type is over-constrained or just plain wrong.   But that problem isn't fixed by this change,  it is just made more obvious.\n\nIn light of:\n\n> I'm also not looking forward to 20 PRs full of 'convert one type of cast to another'\n\nI too think this may be just another nit-pick enabling PR,  but,  it is certainly a desirable goal... at some point. \n",
