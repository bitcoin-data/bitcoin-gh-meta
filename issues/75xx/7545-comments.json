Before 0.12, the success threshold was 85% but this contributed to being too slow to react to changes in fee market conditions.\n\nIt is very difficult to have a fee which is high enough to confirm consistently in the next block, this is in part because of transaction propagation delay but mostly due to miners only recreating the block template periodically.\n",
