Is it safe to copy & paste `blocks/` subdirectory only?\r\n\r\n2. Is it possible to import blkXXXXX.dat directly? (without concatenating them into a single huge `bootstrap.dat`)\r\n\r\n3. Can importing from `bootstrap.dat` work well with pruning enabled?\r\n\r\nI'm curious about a fork-coin known as Bitcoin Clashic. I once tried a trick to avoid creating `bootstrap.dat`, but it didn't seem to work well, with Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Clashic (Bitcoin ABC):\r\n\r\n1. Spin up a VM which is running Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS x64, while the host OS is Windows 10 1809 x64;\r\n\r\n2. Use SMB to share the `blocks/` subdirectory on host OS;\r\n\r\n3. Install nbd-server and nbd-client on VM guest OS;\r\n\r\n4. Mount the SMB share in the guest OS;\r\n\r\n5. Create symlinks for each blkXXXXX.dat, for example: `block.0` -> `blk00000.dat`, `block.1` -> `blk00001.dat`...\r\n\r\n6. Configure smb-server and smb-client to create `/dev/nbd0` which \"virtually concatenate every blkXXXXX.dat together\";\r\n\r\n7. Create a \"bootstrap.dat\" symlink pointing to `/dev/nbd0`;\r\n\r\n8. Set `prune=550` in `~/.bitcoin.conf`\r\n\r\n9. Start (Qt GUI wallet version of) Bitcoin ABC (or Bitcoin Core) to let it import blocks from the \"virtual bootstrap.dat\".\r\n\r\nAs far as I could remember, after a long-lasting HDD buzzing, only a small portion (~140) of blocks were successfully imported.\r\n\r\nI once struggled to bypass this problem, like delete&re-create symlinks for a little number (like 3) of blkXXXXX.dat file only, but it didn't work, either, or even worse - Bitcoin ABC (or Bitcoin Core) would straightforwardly crash due to insufficient storage (tmpfs) space.",
