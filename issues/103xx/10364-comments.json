It seems quite odd to me to have a *single* fuzzing binary and input corpus.\r\n\r\nAny modern fuzzer (at least libfuzzer) is taking code coverage into account when generating new input. By joining all APIs to be fuzzed into a single call, and use the first 32 bit to switch between them, I'm sure we make genetic algorithm looking for inputs less efficient.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, it would be a lot more efficient to use *separate* binaries for each API to be fuzzed, *and* to use a separate corpus for each of them. It doesn't make much sense to test all inputs against all APIs.",

It has several threads of unrelated discussion going on, which are either no longer applicable today or remain questionable and unsolved.\r\n\r\n* Discussion about a test harness https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/test/test_bitcoin_fuzzy.cpp: We now have a full fuzz suite and this harness no longer exists in that form.\r\n* Discussion about the libfuzzer integration. This has already happened https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/fuzzing.md we support afl and libfuzzer. Support for more fuzz engines is welcome. \r\n* Discussion about the disclosure policy of oss-fuzz: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/739#issuecomment-614831028 explains why the strict public disclosure policy is unsuitable for this project.\r\n",
