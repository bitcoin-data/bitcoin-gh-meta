   "body" : "For both `getrawmempool true` and `getmempoolentry` it should probably have a field `effectivefeerate`.\r\n\r\nWhere as \"effective fee rate\" is defined as what miners sort transactions by (when taking into consideration the whole CPFP stuff).\r\n\r\nI need this field for when trying to create my own CPFP transactions, but it's quite difficult to calculate myself (especially as the mempool entries don't have a \"dependants\" field, so you need to dump the whole mempool, which currently takes me about ~26 seconds alone). \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThis is useful for when trying to do something like CPFP as you want to know the pre-existing fee rate. The term I use in my code that deals with this is \"transaction cluster\" which might make a decent term. It could expose a \"clusterSize\" and \"clusterFee\"  so you can calculate the feerate (as well as know the total size of the cluster)\r\n  ",
