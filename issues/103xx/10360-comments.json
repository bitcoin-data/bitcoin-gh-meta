It's hard to say the net effect especially since we disallow negative effective value inputs, but something to think about. OTOH If we wait until everything is an unambiguous win, I am not sure any changes will get merged.\r\n\r\n> some chatter about general refactoring on IRC\r\n\r\nI really don't mind attempting to tackle more refactoring within this PR. I admittedly did just over minimal refactoring to make it work.",
