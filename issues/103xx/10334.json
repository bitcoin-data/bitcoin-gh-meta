   "body" : "### Describe the issue\r\n`listtransactions` returns a JSON key with the name `bip125-replaceable`, which turns out to be a bad choice for naming. When you run listtransactions through the JSON parser (written in a language such as JavaScript) that maps it to an object then it will try to create a variable with a '-' in it. \r\n\r\nIt will crash the application since '-' is not a valid character for a variable name as it is also a mathematical operator.\r\nHowever the JSON RFC manual does not explicitly forbid the usage of '-' in the key names so technically it is completely valid JSON. The blame is with the people who write the JSON parsers, but I do think it's worth bringing it up as an issue such that this character is prevented in the future.",
