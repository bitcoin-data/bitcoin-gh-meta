When enabled, the wallet will mark any addresses that were used to fund a transaction as \"dirty\" and will avoid using them in funding additional transactions, unless an \"allow dirty\" flag is set.\r\n\r\nIt also adds support to allow dirty addresses in `sendtoaddress`. More tweaks to other RPC commands is necessary but I wanted to keep the PR as small as possible.\r\n\r\nRetroactive flagging of dirty addresses can be done by rescanning the chain.",
