   "body" : "There's some pretty severe limitations with all the current rpc APIs to send a transaction, so I think it might make sense to create a more generalized API that subsumes them (createrawtransaction, fundrawtransaction, sendmany)\r\n\r\nArguments it should have:\r\n\r\n*  `transactions` (from `createcrawtransaction`) with the difference that if you leave `sequence` undefined it uses normal core sequence number picking, instead of 0\r\n\r\n* `amounts` from `sendmany` but *not* an object, but an array of outputs (the current object makes it very annoying to implement batched withdrawal logic when multiple payments are to the same address), along with the addition of `subtractfeefromamount` as an option in the object\r\n\r\n* The options from `fundrawtransaction`, along with the additional ability to pick to broadcast the transaction or not.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnd the return should contain the full transaction, txid, fees paid, and location of the change.",
