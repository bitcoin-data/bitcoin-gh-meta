   "body" : "We (SatoshiLabs) use bitcore for our backend; and bitcore depends on a fork of  bitcoin-core, that adds additional indexes and some other functionality.\r\n\r\nSince bitpay stopped updating the fork to newest bitcoin, effectively making bitcore unable to see segwit, we keep rebasing the code to the latest releases. So I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to try to actually put it into upstream :)\r\n\r\nWhat the code does is adding additional indexes into bitcoin-core that enable to run full block explorer, like insight, and also adds some RPC calls for those indexes. I think it would be beneficial to the ecosystem at large to have these RPC calls/indexes available in upstream. \r\n\r\nMost of the work has been done by @braydonf ; I just rebased the code (first to 0.14.* here - https://github.com/satoshilabs/bitcoin - and on master in this PR) and tested it with segwit. (The original, outdated bitcore code is at https://github.com/bitpay/bitcoin )\r\n\r\nThis is *not* meant as a definitive PR - it is too big and needs to be cleaned up and broken into smaller parts (it's obvious it has been rebased several times) - but more as a request for discussion; I want to know if I should start spending time with cleaning the commits up etc. or if you don't want this functionality in the bitcoin-core at all.\r\n\r\nThe added RPCs are:\r\n\r\n- getblockdeltas\r\n- getblockhashes\r\n- getaddressmempool\r\n- getaddressutxos\r\n- getaddressdeltas\r\n- getaddressbalance\r\n- getaddresstxids\r\n- getspentinfo\r\n\r\nThese calls are sufficient to build block explorer.",
