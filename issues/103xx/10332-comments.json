The current one has significant enough limitations for advanced use cases that I've actually found it easier as a client to use a bitcoin library to create the transaction and then pass it to bitcoin core to sign. \r\n\r\nA simple example is that when you're batching sends, you might not want to send to the same address multiple times. Or maybe you want to use a particular input  (e.g. when issuing someone a refund/withdrawal, you want to make sure if their initial payment failed to confirm their refund would also do so)\r\n",

      "body" : "> It seems perhaps not the purpose of the bitcoin software to deal with that?\r\n\r\nI think this is getting a bit off-topic, but there's no particular reason that the RPC API should restrict you from sending funds to the same address multiple times. There's a few legitimate use cases for it, and it can also drastically simplify the clients logic (i.e. can assume a unique txid:vout for each queued send).\r\n\r\n> And if you want to use a particular input, would this one not do the trick:\r\n> createrawtransaction [{ \"txid\":\"input_txhash\",\"vout\":input_n }] {\"refund_address\": refund_amount}\r\n\r\nNot really, that has a few problems. For one, all those inputs would have a sequence of 0, which would make your transactions more recognizable. Then you still need to deal with cases like adding change address and sourcing additional inputs if needed (i.e. all the stuff fundrawtransaction does). And then you need to figure out how much fees to apply (which changes based on the size of the transaction.\r\n\r\nAnd then by the time you've solved all those problems, you'd probably just wish there was a generalized api call for it... ;D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
