      "body" : "I have a little update regarding this issue. \r\nAfter too much time trying different stuff, I went the easy way, formatted the disk to NTFS and retried on a Windows machine. Everything looking fine, but we'll see about Linux drivers for NTFS once the download is finished.  \r\nI'm not sure, but it might be very possible that the Paragon extFS driver caused the issue. I wanted to have the drive be ext4 so the Raspberry Pi that I'm going to use later (to have the node always online) won't have any issues. This meant that I had to install this 3rd party driver for the Mac.\r\nSo everybody trying to setup a HDD for a Linux system on a Mac, maybe do a dual-boot or something like that to prevent this issue.",
