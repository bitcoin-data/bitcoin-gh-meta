Running the new script \"gitian-build.py\" in the contrib folder should output me with assert files to be signed, but instead drops this error:\r\n\r\n```--- Building for bionic amd64 ---\r\nStopping target if it is up\r\nMaking a new image copy\r\nlxc-init: missing container name, use --name option\r\nbin/gbuild:21:in `system!': failed to run make-clean-vm --suite bionic --arch amd64 (RuntimeError)\r\n        from bin/gbuild:57:in `build_one_configuration'\r\n        from bin/gbuild:308:in `block (2 levels) in <main>'\r\n        from bin/gbuild:303:in `each'\r\n        from bin/gbuild:303:in `block in <main>'\r\n        from bin/gbuild:301:in `each'\r\n        from bin/gbuild:301:in `<main>'\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"./gitian-build.py\", line 160, in <module>\r\n    main()\r\n  File \"./gitian-build.py\", line 157, in main\r\n    build()\r\n  File \"./gitian-build.py\", line 56, in build\r\n    subprocess.check_call(['bin/gbuild', '-j', args.jobs, '-m', args.memory, '--commit', 'PrivateBTC='+args.commit, '--url', 'bitcoin='+args.url, '../PrivateBTC/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml'])\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.5/subprocess.py\", line 581, in check_call\r\n    raise CalledProcessError(retcode, cmd)\r\nsubprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['bin/gbuild', '-j', '2', '-m', '2000', '--commit', 'PrivateBTC=v0.1', '--url', 'bitcoin=https://github.com/giaki3003/PrivateBTC', '../PrivateBTC/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml']' returned non-zero exit status 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice i did set up a repo called \"PrivateBTC\", forked off the latest BTC source.
