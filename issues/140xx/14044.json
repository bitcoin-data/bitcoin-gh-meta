(Possibly it might even enable using our binaries on non-glibc systems as well?)\r\n\r\nOnly problem is, I can't see a way to instruct ld to do this. The StackOverflow answer above solves it by building the target library without symbols, but so long as we're using Ubuntu-packaged libraries, we can't really do that for glibc.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, I guess this can be solved when we finally build our own libc from scratch, but it'd be nice to find a proper solution.",
