      "body" : "> @ryanofsky Ah, just to clarify Ã¢ÂÂ so these were issues discovered by the linters rather than problems in the linters? :-) Have you encountered any issues in the linters themselves?\r\n\r\nYes, there is the bug in the circular dependencies linter described above: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14041#issuecomment-415839441, a bug in the format-strings linter fixed in #10443 (61ab4c17eebf9b73267c992fb664d603620f9e81), and a bug in include-guards linter fixed in #10102 (0f956d6b0d26c92a1656976b0518e0a469033e47).\r\n\r\nBut to me it is irrelevant whether bug is in the linter or not. For example, the linter bugs I found were pretty easy to fix, but I spent hours refactoring code and introducing a callback mechanism in [pr/fee.18](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/fee.18) (#10443) to avoid referencing CTxMemPoolEntry in fees_input.h and introducing a new circular dependency.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to get warnings when a new linter is added that breaks PRs, so issues can be fixed in advance and don't result in PRs being left conflicted while lint issues are debugged. Since linters are fast to run and don't require building, it seems like it would be very easy to write a script that would check a new linter against a list of PRs and capture all the errors, so PR authors could have advance warning about problems.",
