(versus pushing that off or expanding @sdaftuar's testing framework, instead -* I think having accurate travis builds would provide lots of value)",

That was a strange moment, thanks for clarifying that.\r\n\r\nI also see what you mean about building from source, it seems the jar in `TheBlueMatt/test-scripts` was compiled in a native environment and then distributed using Github, which doesn't feel very good from a deployment perspective. \r\n\r\nIt looks like you're spot-on regarding hash-branch correlations too, I see the tip of `TheBlueMatt/blocktester` is the same hash as whats in the tip of `TheBlueMatt/test-scripts` (the jar, at least); and I think my preference is to try to load the BitcoindComparisonTool tests into the python framework as well.\r\n\r\nSince it likely means debugging the comparison tool, I'll probably start there, and seeing as how its probably not a light fix I'd like to ask @sdaftuar: What are your thoughts about expanding the python framework a bit to replace the current tooling? It looks like I'll be debugging things in parallel, so I'm curious if you see any benefit from adding to your code.",

      "body" : "@faizkhan00  I think the next step for the python work is to start recreating the tests from the existing bitcoinj comparison tool in a new python test.  I think there are two main hurdles for this work, one is to just carefully understand the existing tests, and the other is to implement whatever additional python infrastructure might be needed to make for well-written tests (ie that are easy to read, write, update, understand, etc).  Not sure yet exactly what those infrastructure changes will look like, but I'm guessing we'll need to refine the ```BlockStore``` object (in ```blockstore.py```) and maybe the ```TestInstance``` in ```comptool.py```, and likely need to add some additional code to support signing transactions.\r\n\r\nI guess a third hurdle is that I think there may be bugs in the existing bitcoinj tests.  For instance one issue I've been meaning to track down but haven't yet is this apparent bug mentioned in an old PR, #2884.\r\n\r\nAnyway I am planning to start working on a python reimplementation, but I expect it to take a while before all the tests are rewritten and before everyone would be comfortable cutting over from the existing tests to a new one.  So if you do spend time debugging/patching the bitcoinj version, which actually also needs to be patched for #5966, that should be generally helpful I think.\r\n\r\nAlso if you're interested in diving in and writing python tests please feel free, though unfortunately I haven't written up documentation yet to explain how the code is structured and how to write new tests (it's on my list of things to do once the interface feels more settled, probably after the next round of changes) -- for now I'd suggest looking at the tests added in #5981 for examples to follow and reading the comments in the code.  And feel free to ping me with any specific questions in the meantime.",
