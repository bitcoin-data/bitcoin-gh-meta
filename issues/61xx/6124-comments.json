It'll be very useful once it's rolled out!\r\n\r\nI ran some CLTV style micropayment channel deposit and refund tests on testnet.\r\n\r\nOverall, the changes look good.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering why you chose to make OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY not pop the input argument off the top of the stack in the success case?\r\n\r\nIn the success case, by not popping, the semantic of the original no-op definition of OP_NOP2 is preserved. I assume that maintaining the no-op semantic for old clients, so that they could still validate scripts using the new semantic of the opcode, was your reason.\r\nIf so, did you have any other reason, like you were also trying to save an upgradable nopcode by not using one for a matching non-verify OP_CHECKLOCKTIME (to fit the pattern of OP_CHECKSIG+OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY, OP_EQUAL+OP_EQUALVERIFY, etc...)?\r\n\r\nDuring the transition, I don't think preserving the no-op semantic in this case is desirable for the same reason that it is not desirable to start using CLTV outputs prior to the 95% lock-in during a soft fork -- the refund path in CLTV scripts could be interpreted as no-op's on non-time-locked transactions to claim the refund outputs early.\r\n\r\nIf backwards compatibility for older clients was the only reason, then I think that changing to popping the input stack argument should be considered because:\r\n- Doing so would be consistent with the other \"verify\" opcodes (i.e.- OP_VERIFY, OP_EQUALVERIFY, OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY, OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY, and OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY).\r\n- Doing so is still soft-fork compatible\r\n- During a soft-fork transition, before 95% lock-in, breaking validation of the new scripts in old clients seems preferable, since, for example, we'd like to avoid having premature adopters of CLTV bond refund scripts get early refunds going through (via finalized inputs or earlier than expected transaction nLockTimes). Having new scripts expect that the stack is popped on success would break the new scripts on older validators.\r\n- After the semantic transition is locked-in, it seems that most of the uses of OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY would not need the argument left on the stack. Having to repeat the OP_DROP everytime seems kludgy. People that need the argument to remain on the stack could precede the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY with an OP_DUP.\r\n\r\nMake sense?",

Having it read as OP_NOP2 could be misleading, especially to casual users, after the new semantic is in effect. As far as timing, it's not critical to update the opcode name decode right now (especially if it pushes this pull request out further). The decode update could be done along with the soft-fork updates, or even later as a part of an opcode decode name cleanup (where the \"OP_\" prefixes get dropped, etc...). But, since there is the justification of being complete with the semantic change, I think it is acceptable to break any possible ill-advised external dependencies on the existing \"asm\" decode.",
