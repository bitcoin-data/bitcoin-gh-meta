   "body" : "I posted issue #6170  and was satisfied with the \"solution\", but i'm not anymore.\n\nI just logged to the linux virtual machine in my Windows PC that i was using to deploy for the remote server and the same files are missing. The difference is that bitcoind was not running, no bitcoin operations were being done at all. I just tried to run bitcoind and it warned i had no .conf. \n\nIn both cases #6170 and in the virtual machine i was using ubuntu 12.04 and bitcoin latest version from ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin. That's odd.\n\nOnly these are left in /root/.bitcoin/\nblocks  chainstate  database  db.log  debug.log\n\nMy personal computer is not compromised as i supposed my remote linux server was, my wallet on Windows is safe here with considerable amount of bitcoins.\n",
