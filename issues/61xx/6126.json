   "body" : "I think picking this number is mostly bike-shedding, but if/when #5159 gets merged, then it's more likely that `estimateFee 1` will occasionally give a very high estimate, so setting the default lower will prevent accidentally spending too much on fees.   I don't think these high estimates are problematic but just indicate busy times when you actually need a very high fee to be reliably confirmed in the next block.  Also it's almost impossible to have a priority that is high enough to get you confirmed in the next block, so this helps with sending free transactions as well.  (Note the default remains 25 on the GUI)\n",
