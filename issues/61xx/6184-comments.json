      "body" : "@BitpopCoin Thanks for reporting this; I think I see the problem.\r\n\r\nThe pruning code enforces a requirement that the block files it keeps be contiguous, so that blockfile N will only be considered for pruning if blockfiles 0, ..., N-1 were already pruned.\r\n\r\nThere is also a requirement that no block file will be pruned if there's a block in the file with a height that is too close to the height of the tip.  What appears to be happening here is that some peer likely inv'ed you a block at the tip while you were syncing (this is normal behavior); that block was stored in block file 5, and since its height is so large, it effectively stops pruning from taking place.  From the debug.log:\r\n\r\n```2015-05-28 01:03:59 Leaving block file 5: CBlockFileInfo(blocks=7446, size=134174305, heights=148758...358316, time=2011-10-10...2015-05-28)```\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, if the node were able to fully sync, I believe eventually the pruning targets would be respected again.  This is certainly undesirable behavior though.\r\n\r\nI think the best fix may be to relax the restriction that files be contiguous, which will complicate the logic slightly but seems likely to be worth it to avoid this outcome.",

But I've originally used 25gb and it continues past 30gb breaking my droplet.\r\n\r\nI think pruning will be used for limited disks and going over at all will break things. Can you add a quit for now? So when I do test I don't have to spend an extra hour imaging the machine and restoring because the disk filled up and other things could have broke.\r\n\r\nI run many nodes and upgrading will double my costs so I need pruning.
