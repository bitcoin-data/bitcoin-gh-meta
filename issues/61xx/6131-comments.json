It uses the result of `estimatePriority` to determine if it can send free, unless `estimatePriority` doesn't give you an answer, in which case it'll use `AllowFree`.   This can cause the odd behavior of being more likely to send a low priority transaction for free if you're asking to be confirmed in 1 block (for which no priority is big enough) than if you're asking to be confirmed in 10 blocks (for which your priority isn't big enough).   It should either use `AllowFree` for everything, which would be the literal interpretation of \"if possible\" or it should use `estimatePriority` and interpret -1 as an indication that you can not send for free.  The latter would be more useful and is what this pull does.  Sorry for the delayed response.",
