      "body" : "@jgarzik 's observations come into focus now.  The current code potentially opens the debug.log as soon as the chainparams are configured and parameter interaction warnings are printed.  This happens before the debug log is shrunk and the datadir lock is acquired.  This now just pushes the cut and version message into that grey area.  Really what this needs is a rework to do the buffering along with an explicit opening of the debug.log during startup, rather than the current open on first use strategy.\r\n\r\nOk, sorry for the spam.  I'll get the real rework going and PR it.",
