For consistency, it would be better to have the consensus version start with Check. But since this may be considered bikesheding, let me explain what the options I see. Let's imagine this in smaller commits that have been squashed and consider stopping at each point.\n\n1) Fix the bug without touching IsFinalTx, simply by appropriately  adapting the arguments in the pertinent calls (like the one in miner). We could simply stop here (or at any point).\n\n2) Separate a stateless (consensus-friendly) version of the function, like in #6063 .\n\n3) Every call to the old function that passes both arguments and passes them as non-null values, can be safely replaced with a call to the new function, great. You can go further and only leave the old calls that were using the default null values (triggering the replacement with the global state).\n\n4) Now we can safely remove the optional parameters from the old function, since nobody is using them (the calls that use the parameters now call to the new statelss function).\n\n5) Maybe we wanted to make the fix at this point instead of doing it first, since now you can fix it inside the stateless function and presumably less calls will be affected.\n\n6) Assuming we had chosen IsFinalTx for the old global-state-dependent function and CheckFinalTx for the new stateless version (as in #6063 ), we can now switch the names to gratuitously increase the total diff, make the stateless version name less consistent with other consensus functions names and complicate the rebase of branches that were already separating those functions (like #6051 and branches based on it) or that were touching changing IsFinalTx (like https://github.com/maaku/bitcoin/commits/seqno-cltv-csv).\n\nLet's please stop before 6. Let's forget about naming and making me and possibly other people work more. I propose to use a cleaner git history as the main criterion. My approach is better because it will produce a smaller total diff (since some calls that were using the default values can remain untouched). \n",

Importantly, by changing everything else we get it all onto a new function with guaranteed semantics of \"just figure out if this transaction is final according to whatever rules exist\" - exactly what you'd expect from a Check*() function!

I have to say that passing a CBlockIndex\\* from the beginning instead of using the global tip would make the function more stateless and my concerns with it being named CheckFinalTx would be lower, specially if it's going to be fully statelss later by not calling GetAdjustedTime().\nWhat about passing a CBlockIndex from the beginning? This will not increase the total diff either.\nMaybe also moving to from GetAdjustedTime to GetMedianTime in this PR. Tat would make CheckFinalTx stateless from the beginning: that would make me happy as well.\n\nSo, to reiterate and in summary: a function named CheckFinalTx should be as stateless as possible from the beginning: using the global activeTip inside it, even temporarily, seems horrendous to me.\nI now realize that there's more options than I was considering to make that happen.\n",
