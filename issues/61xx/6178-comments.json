I proposed earlier that we just add a very simple callback option to EvalScript() to optionally execute a function at each step in a way guaranteed to not be able to change the EvalScript() loop state unless desired.\r\n\r\nGiven how limited the scripting system is, I just don't see there being much demand for a full-on, fully consensus accurate, debugger; if you do need a debugger for your script it's almost certainly too complex. Simply providing a mechanism to get a good instruction trace if desired should be fine and it's a lot less risky than this pull-req.",

The consensus risks of non-trivially changing consensus code will have to be compensated with testing, but it's not like https://github.com/luke-jr/bitcoin/commit/978d000c6201951b4611f7374c72de9988516c3c is hard to read or review. The rest are just enhancements to libconsensus' API, so I don't really see where the huge risks are.\r\nMaybe luke should  reduce the scope of the PR to that single commit and leave the changes on libconsensus for a later PR, would you consider that less risky?\r\nBecause https://github.com/luke-jr/bitcoin/commit/978d000c6201951b4611f7374c72de9988516c3c  looks really safe and elegant to me. \r\n",
