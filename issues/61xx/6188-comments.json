I wonder if perhaps your node requested the block from a peer that disconnected while the block was in flight, but the disconnect was slow to be fully processed.\r\n\r\nIt looks like when a peer disconnects, we take it out of vNodes, but leave it hanging around in vNodesDisconnected while we try to clean up.  I don't know what might trigger that cleanup process to stall, but if it were to stall, then I think it would match what you've reported here, where getpeerinfo wouldn't return any blocks in flight (since it loops over vNodes to see what those peers have outstanding), but mapBlocksInFlight would still have an entry for that block hash (since that only gets cleaned up when the peer is actually deleted, which doesn't happen until being removed from vNodesDisconnected), preventing FindNextBlocksToDownload from returning it.",
