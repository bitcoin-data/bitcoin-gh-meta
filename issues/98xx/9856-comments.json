An allocation of a 4 GB buffer somewhere in the program may fail, but that may be perfectly fine if it can continue with a smaller buffer. It doesn't mean the rest of the application, which will never allocate a big buffer like that, is in a bad state. *Specificallly* we care deeply about bad_allocs thrown by consensus and block/utxo handling code. Error handling in Bitcoin Core has always been a bit flakey, and in a way his feels a bit like throwing in the towel on reasoned error handling completely.So that's why my angry reply. Sorry for that.  But we need this now to avoid corruption problems.  I think we should continue with this.",
