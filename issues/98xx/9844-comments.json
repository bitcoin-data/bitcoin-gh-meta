And they want their wallet data on their USB drive fully encrypted, incase they lose it somewhere they don't want people to know their transaction history and balance.  It would be much easier if the client could change the loaded wallet after its been started, by finding the wallet in a file explorer popup... and the file was fully encrypted on USB drive.\r\n\r\nI know I'm asking for a lot now...  imo the client should be able to open and close wallets, not just specify wallet file on startup via command line.

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI have built a few apps on top of Bitcoin Core [Fully Noded](https://github.com/Fonta1n3/FullyNoded) and [FullyNoded 2](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/FullyNoded-2). In the apps users have the ability to connect to a node via a QR code which is essentially a tor v3 hidden service controlling rpc port that conforms to http protocol for rpc auth.\r\n\r\nThis makes it incredibly easy for users to connect to nodes via QR scanning. This makes it an ideal way to share your node with others.\r\n\r\nFullyNoded 2 uses the nodes wallets in a watch-only capacity only so it is not possible to spend from the wallets however if you share your node with someone else they can obviously have full access and see your balances, complete and utter loss of privacy.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAn obvious solution to this would be the ability to utilize `bitcoin-cli encryptwallet` for public keys and private keys so that a user is prompted for a decrytion password for any operation to do with public keys. This way you can share a node with watch-only wallets but maintain privacy via a strong secondary encryption password.",
