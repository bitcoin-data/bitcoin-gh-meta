Normally it's set up to go as fast as possible so also will ask as much from your system as possible.\r\n\r\nThere are a few options to tweak this.

For some laptop harddisks, especially on Windows, that's pretty much reality :)\r\n\r\nThe problem will usually be not that it uses 100%, but that it starves other processes of using I/O. In that cast an approach as implemented in #9245 (could use testing, but I think is Linux-only at the moment) would be useful.",

Full nodes are those that keep a UTXO set and validate blocks.
