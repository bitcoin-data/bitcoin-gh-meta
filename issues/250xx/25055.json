   "body" : "I was curious about this while perusing through `setup_common.cpp`. It seems to me that:\r\n\r\n1. `m_node.args` is an alias to `gArgs`\r\n2. `m_args` is its own thing\r\n3. Extra arguments supplied to `*TestingSetup` ctors are parsed into `m_node.args`/`gArgs`, `m_args` is left alone\r\n4. The only usage of `m_args` is in the chainstate loading sequence I added and in various tests where only its `GetDataDirBase()` member is called\r\n\r\nTherefore it seems that the current uses of `m_args` in the chainstate loading sequence in `TestingSetup::TestingSetup` is incorrect, and we should likely remove `m_args` to avoid further confusion since it's not serving any useful purpose.\r\n\r\nWould love some context here!",
