If you have a wallet name with an embedded space and you issue an RPC like \r\n\r\n_http://192.168.4.48:6433/wallet/encrypted+with+space_\r\n\r\nIt fails with \"wallet not found\", which is a bug.  The wallet does exist; the RPC doesnt properly handle embedded spaces.  I will highlight the RPC code issues shortly.",
