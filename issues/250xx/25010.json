Is it possible to save the last processed blocked at shutdown?\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if wallet code would call `WriteBestBlock` and save the last scan position if it is interrupted during a sync. This could be implemented by trying to save the scan position during the shutdown, or by just periodically saving the scan position after an interval, similar to indexing code which saves sync position once every 30 seconds:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f0a834e2f10a0aa60c7cc76e9f3eb090168a32e5/src/index/base.cpp#L170-L175",
