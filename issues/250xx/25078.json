   "body" : "GitHub has an extensive documentation about permissions ( https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization#permissions-for-each-role ), so I don't think we should be trying to mirror them here.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this pull makes three changes:\r\n\r\n* Clarify that all \"merge maintainers\" can merge pull requests. Obviously, while GitHub users with the `Maintain` permission can not force push to protected branches, and GitHub users with the `Admin` permission can, I don't think this is worthy to mention in the contribution guidelines. During the whole time I was working on the project, I think this permission was only used once or twice, when I accidentally pushed an unsigned draft commit directly to `master`. See https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2016-06-13#473584 . One could argue that there should be a list of maintainers in the doc. Though, as there is already a list of keys for verify-commits, this seems like unnecessary overhead.\r\n* Clarify that the release process is executed collectively by the developers. For example, release process code changes that are reproducible can be done by anyone without permission. Also, detached signatures are created by several people (see for example https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-detached-sigs/commits/23.0), which (I believe) are also separate from the people that can push the binaries to the `bin` folder, which again are separate from the people who can release the snap/flatpak package.\r\n* Clarify that moderation is also done collectively by people with `Triage`, `Write`, `Maintain`, and `Admin` permission. I think it is fine to refer to everyone in that group as \"maintainers\", or at least don't clarify it further, as any attempt at that would start to duplicate GitHub docs.",
