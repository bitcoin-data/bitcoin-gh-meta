      "body" : "I think the goal is that code being tested by unit tests should be using settings from the `BasicTestingSetup::m_args`, not `gArgs`. `m_node.args` is a pointer that currently points to `gArgs` so current tests work, but will later point to `m_args`, so future tests will be self-contained.. Eventually `gArgs` should go away entirely, or if it is kept, maybe it will just be used to pass options to the test framework itself (logging options, random seeds, etc).\r\n\r\nProbably a good strategy for writing tests is to use `m_args` where possible, use `m_node.args` if that's not possible, and avoid ever referencing `gArgs` directly. But if this is too confusing we could eliminiate `m_args` like you suggest. The last place this was discussed was https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21244#discussion_r615307465 so that might provide more context.",
