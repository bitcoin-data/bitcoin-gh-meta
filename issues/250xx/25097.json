Thus some of the tests must be \"indirect\", testing the unit-under-test by probing a visible caller.  This makes those specific somewhat fragile as they depend on code paths in the caller, which may change in the future.  However, such tests are written so they will fail if the unit-under-test isn't actually called.  This is noted in the code of those specific tests.\r\n\r\n- [x] `EvalChecksigTapscript`\r\n- [x] `HandleMissingData`\r\n- [ ] `SignatureHashSchnorr`\r\n- [ ] `GenericTransactionSignatureChecker<T>::VerifySchnorrSignature`\r\n- [ ] `GenericTransactionSignatureChecker<T>::CheckSchnorrSignature`\r\n- [ ] `ComputeTaprootMerkleRoot`\r\n- [ ] `SigVersion::TAPSCRIPT` code paths in `ExecuteWitnessScript`\r\n- [ ] `Tapproot code paths in `VerifyWitnessProgram`\r\n",
