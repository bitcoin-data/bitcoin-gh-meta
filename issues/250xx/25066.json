   "body" : "The Bitcoin Core wallet window has icons in the lower right corner. One of those icons is the letters \"HD\". With the v.22.0 version when passing the mouse cursor over this icon, a message appeared which said \"HD key generation is enabled\". However, after downloading the latest version of Bitcoin Core, 23.0, the message that appears to me is the opposite: \"HD key generation is disabled\". (1st screenshot).\r\n\r\nThe wallet had no funds and, in that sense, I have not lost anything. But I am concerned that after upgrading Bitcoin Core to the latest version, the HD key generation has changed. I'm pretty new to this and don't understand much. I have asked, read and looked for some solution but no one has been able to tell me what happens, whether it is normal or not, what the solution is...etc.\r\n\r\nAlso note that, when using the \"getwalletinfo\" command in the Bitcoin Core console, appeared this (2nd screenshot) and that I do not know if it refers to the same (HD key generation) or not.\r\n\r\nAlso tried to upgrade the bitcoin core wallet with the \"upgradewallet\" comand. (3rd screenshot)\r\n\r\nI got the latest version of bitcoin core from: https://bitcoincore.org/. And i got this url from the Bitcoin Core Project profile on twitter.\r\n\r\nMy OS is windows 10 Pro. And my CPU is a Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4460  CPU @ 3.20GHz   3.20 GHz.\r\n\r\nFor me this is first time doing this...so sorry for what might be wrong, and sorry for my english (i do not speak it well enough)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Captura de pantalla 2022-05-05 113132](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102556812/166897054-de8b92e4-dd8c-4aa1-8036-a6afed27cdcd.png)\r\n![Captura de pantalla 2022-05-01 200018](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102556812/166898222-f384fe51-f54d-4636-96fd-566b46ee8d69.png)\r\n![UPGRADE WALLET](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102556812/166899581-9801e82e-94f7-4c8e-a37e-ec07580255c8.png)\r\n\r\n",
