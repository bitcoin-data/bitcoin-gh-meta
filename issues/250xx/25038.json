In particular, this allows LN users to replace commitment transactions existing in the mempool, simply by broadcasting the commitment transaction with a high-fee child (provided it pays enough fees to replace the existing tx along with its descendants).\r\n\r\nThis is similar to what was proposed on the [mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019464.html), except the \"package must have a higher ancestor feerate than all original transactions\" rule has been removed (see [discussion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23121#issuecomment-1004774370)). It has been replaced with a rule analogous to BIP 125 Rule 2, \"All transactions in the package, including those that do not directly conflict with any mempool transactions, only include an unconfirmed input if that input was included in one of the directly conflicting transactions or is from another transaction in the package.\"\r\n\r\nThere are limitations with this policy, but none that don't already exist in single-transaction-RBF. If/when RBF rules change, package RBF rules can be amended as well.",
