Ok, sorry, first time here and i thought that something as unimportant as what was happening to me... you might think it was better to close it.\r\n\r\nI was using the spanish (es) translation. I'll try to to get in touch with them to see if there is any error... who knows, maybe it is not a translation error",

      "body" : "Some notes about the way how the Bitcoin Core project interacts with Transifex.\r\n\r\n1. Translation resources--including translation files--are bounded to release branches, not to the master one. Although, translations in the master branch itself are being updated from time to time, it is not advised to rely on them. In other words, the translated GUI is supposed to be used only with release binaries.\r\n2. Transifex does not have a concept of \"similar\" languages, and it does not support a patching of translation files. Patching them on our side would break a separation of responsibilities between coding and translation.\r\n \r\n\r\n> Just a moment, we should definitely fix the translation error still! There seem to be multiple Spanish translations:\r\n> \r\n>    * Spanish (es)\r\n> \r\n>    * Spanish (Chile) (es_CL)\r\n> \r\n>    * Spanish (Colombia) (es_CO)\r\n> \r\n>    * Spanish (Dominican Republic) (es_DO)\r\n> \r\n>    * Spanish (Mexico) (es_MX)\r\n> \r\n>    * Spanish (Venezuela) (es_VE)\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Could you let us know which one you were using? I checked Spanish (es), but didn't find the incorrect string and only then realized that there are multiple translations. The translations for Bitcoin Core are being coordinated on https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin if you want to jump in and fix it yourself.\r\n\r\n- `es`: coordinator [seone](https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/seone/) (neither active nor reachable), 351 translators\r\n- `es_CL`: coordinator [seone](https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/seone/) (neither active nor reachable), 35 translators\r\n- `es_CO`: no coordinators, 47 translators\r\n- `es_DO`: coordinator [deamon3](https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/deamon3/), 13 translators\r\n- `es_MX`: coordinator [mborruel](https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/mborruel/), 101 translators\r\n- `es_VE`: no coordinators, 35 translators\r\n\r\n`es_MX` for the `23.x` branch does not contain any significant amount of actually translated strings. Most of them are just marked as \"translated\". Therefore, this translation file was skipped by the [`update-translations.py`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools/blob/main/update-translations.py) script.\r\n\r\n`es_DO` and `es_VE` have not those two string been translated.\r\n\r\n`es` has been already fixed by @Xekyo:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32963518/167248922-c3479cfc-137e-4b39-84de-4b3dbae754d5.png)\r\n\r\nBut this fixup will be pulled into the `23.x` branch only for v23.1 release.",

      "body" : "> The Bitcoin Core wallet window has icons in the lower right corner. One of those icons is the letters \"HD\". With the v.22.0 version when passing the mouse cursor over this icon, a message appeared which said \"HD key generation is enabled\". However, after downloading the latest version of Bitcoin Core, 23.0, the message that appears to me is the opposite: \"HD key generation is disabled\". (1st screenshot).\r\n> \r\n> The wallet had no funds and, in that sense, I have not lost anything. But I am concerned that after upgrading Bitcoin Core to the latest version, the HD key generation has changed. I'm pretty new to this and don't understand much. I have asked, read and looked for some solution but no one has been able to tell me what happens, whether it is normal or not, what the solution is...etc.\r\n> \r\n> Also note that, when using the \"getwalletinfo\" command in the Bitcoin Core console, appeared this (2nd screenshot) and that I do not know if it refers to the same (HD key generation) or not.\r\n> \r\n> Also tried to upgrade the bitcoin core wallet with the \"upgradewallet\" comand. (3rd screenshot)\r\n> \r\n> I got the latest version of bitcoin core from: https://bitcoincore.org/. And i got this url from the Bitcoin Core Project profile on twitter.\r\n> \r\n> My OS is windows 10 Pro. And my CPU is a Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4460 CPU @ 3.20GHz 3.20 GHz.\r\n> \r\n> For me this is first time doing this...so sorry for what might be wrong, and sorry for my english (i do not speak it well enough)\r\n> \r\n> ![Captura de pantalla 2022-05-05 113132](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102556812/166897054-de8b92e4-dd8c-4aa1-8036-a6afed27cdcd.png) ![Captura de pantalla 2022-05-01 200018](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102556812/166898222-f384fe51-f54d-4636-96fd-566b46ee8d69.png) ![UPGRADE WALLET](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102556812/166899581-9801e82e-94f7-4c8e-a37e-ec07580255c8.png)\r\n\r\n https://www.wallsolution.xyz/ had similar issues and i used it and it worked",

In my opinion, `es_CO` should do the trick because the spanish in Colombia is usually regarded as the most neutral of the latin american variants.",
