Please describe.**\n\nHumanity's carbon emissions debt.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nA mechanism to pause mining for a designated number of months/years while humanity gets its shit together.\n\nIntroducing scarcity could help increase the value of the 18 million coins already minted, leaving the last couple of million coins in the ground for sometime in the near future.\n\nEngineering effort would be required to facilitate transactions/ledger. Maybe consensus of hash ranges that hold no value.\n\nBitcoin can still achieve its goals. Today's miners can still be rich (with less on-going effort). By removing a country worth of emissions in 2021, this tech can truly be a part of the solution, rather than being part of the problem.",
