   "body" : "# Timeline\r\n\r\nThe v22.0 Feature Freeze is on **June 15th**, which is 17 weeks from **Feb 11th**. With that in mind, what follows is a tentative timeline for us to switch from Gitian release builds to Guix ones for v22.0, subject to change.\r\n\r\n## Minimum Viable Build (~5 wks ending March 18th)\r\n### Outstanding PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #20629 | depends: Improve id string robustness\r\n- [ ] #21087 | guix: Passthrough BASE_CACHE into container \r\n- [ ] #21088 | guix: Jump forwards in time-machine and adapt\r\n- [ ] #21089 | guix: Add support for powerpc64{,le}\r\n\r\n### TODOs\r\n- Workflow-related\r\n\t- guix: Add Windows+macOS codesigning functionality (already WIP)\r\n\t- guix: Add replacements for `g{sign,verify}` (already WIP)\r\n\t- Setting up a `bitcoin-core/guix.sigs` GitHub repository\r\n- Documentation-related\r\n\t- guix: Add installation instructions for Guix specific to Bitcoin Core builds\r\n\t*The GNU manual is too generic at times and somewhat difficult to navigate*\r\n\t- guix: Update all release documentation for new Guix process\r\n\t*`release-process.md` et al.*\r\n\r\n## User testing + refinement (~5 wks ending April 22nd)\r\n\r\nAt this point, users should be able to follow `release-process.md` in order to perform Guix builds and attest to their outputs in `guix.sigs`.\r\n\r\nIn order to further improve the usability of this process, I will work with a few brave volunteers to walk through the core parts of `release-process.md`, namely:\r\n\r\n1. Installing Guix on their build machine\r\n2. Setting up a directory structure for Guix builds\r\n3. Performing a non-codesigned Guix build\r\n4. Uploading their SHA256SUMs and signatures to `guix.sigs`\r\n\r\nWhat to expect should you be brave enough to volunteer:\r\n\r\n1. I will open a direct line of communication where you can reach me for help\r\n2. I will document hiccups and open PRs to address common problems\r\n3. Depending on the performance characteristics of your build machine, whether or not you are using substitutes, and whether you request that Guix bootstraps, these builds can take up to a day or two.\r\n    I know it's fun to watch build logs scroll by ð , but we will most likely start the build on day `n` and check back on it on day `n+1`\r\n\r\nI would especially like to help volunteers who are not running Debian/Ubuntu, as diverse testing across distros/kernels is always a plus!\r\n\r\nPlease reach out to me if you are willing to volunteer for this.\r\n\r\n## Release dress rehearsal + refinement  (~3 wks ending May 13th)\r\n\r\nAfter we have performed user testing and ironed out usability kinks, I would like to do a dress rehearsal for the full release process.\r\n\r\nHere's how this differs from just \"user testing\":\r\n\r\n1. The commit we build will be tagged\r\n2. Codesignatures will be made and uploaded to `bitcoin-detached-sigs`\r\n3. SHA256SUMs and signatures of codesigned binaries will be uploaded to `guix.sigs`\r\n\r\nThis is to make sure that when we do the actual release for v22.0, there are no surprises.\r\n\r\n## Contingency buffer (~4+ wks ending June 15th)\r\nIf we run into any surprises (and I'm sure we will) this contingency buffer will give us some breathing room before the feature freeze.\r\n\r\n# What I need help with\r\n\r\n## High-priority\r\n\r\n- Review of outstanding PRs\r\n- Volunteers for user testing (Available sometime between March 19th and April 22nd)\r\n- Feedback on this timeline and remaining tasks outlined: am I missing anything? too optimistic?\r\n\r\n## Normal Priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Setting up a `bitcoin-core/guix.sigs` GitHub repository\r\n- [ ] Verifying that Guix debug symbol output works\r\n\r\n## Nice-to-have's\r\n\r\n- Packaging Guix v1.2.0 for your favourite distribution (please reach out if you do attempt this, I may be able to offer help!)\r\n",
