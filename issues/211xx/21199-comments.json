If you write xpub/[0-1]/*, do you mean:\r\n* The list xpub/0/0, xpub/1/0, xpub/0/1, xpub/1/1, xpub/0/2, xpub/1/2, ... (just interleaving the lists)\r\n* Changing descriptors to effectively be a description of multiple lists?\r\n* A way of writing two descriptors; perhaps one which is implicitly imbued with the meaning \"payment addresses\" and a second with meaning \"change addresses\" (this is often suggested to avoid the redundancy, but I feel this belongs in a different layer)?\r\n\r\nThe first, if there is a use case for it, would be fairly simple and fit will in the current design. The others are more invasively, and probably not desirable in all places were descriptors are used.",
