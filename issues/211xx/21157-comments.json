Only connecting out over Tor is more private of course when you combine it with no reachable IPv4/IPv6 address, in particular if you want to broadcast transactions without them being correlatable with your IP.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you only make random Tor connections, you're much more vulnerable to Sybil attacks (as Tor addresses have 0 cost to create, an attacker can just flood the network with 1000s of apparent Tor Bitcoin nodes, and have a high probability of receiving all outbound Tor connections a Tor-only node makes). This is significantly less a concern with IPv4/IPv6 (especially with asmap) due to cost of getting IPs in many networks. It's also less a concern if you have `-addnode`d connections to trusted peers (even if they're onion addresses).",

      "body" : "I would also refactor this whole section:\r\n- Current bullet formatting looks akward\r\n- Change the title so that a common naming format can be used if we want to add a guide for another system\r\n  - From: `Example: creating an onion service on Debian/Ubuntu Systems`\r\n  - To: `Setup Guide: Debian/Ubuntu`\r\n- Better explanations per each step \r\n\r\nHere is how that would look. This is just a rough suggestion, so make contextual additions as you see fit:\r\n\r\n## Setup Guide: Debian/Ubuntu\r\n\r\nAssuming you already have an installation of Bitcoin Core:\r\n\r\n##### 1. Install Tor:\r\n\r\nTo install Tor, run:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nsudo apt install tor\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 2. Edit Tor configuration file:\r\n\r\nopen up the `torrc` file with your favorite text editor, this example uses the `nano` text editor:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nsudo nano /etc/tor/torrc\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit the `torrc` file so that it has these settings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nControlPort 9051\r\nCookieAuthentication 1\r\nCookieAuthFileGroupReadable 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 3. Add user to Tor group:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nsudo usermod -a -G debian-tor satoshi\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 4. Restart Tor\r\n\r\nTo restart Tor, run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo systemctl restart tor\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 5. Edit Bitcoin configuration file\r\n\r\nOpen up the `bitcoin.conf` file with your favorite text editor.\r\nEdit the file so that it contains these settings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlisten=1\r\ntorcontrol=127.0.0.1:9051\r\ndebug=tor\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 6. Confirmation\r\nYou should be all set up to run a node through the Tor Network.\r\nYou can confirm that everything is setup correctly by running the `getnetworkinfo` \r\nRPC command. The result should look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocaladdresses\": [\r\n  {\r\n    \"address\": \"omy7kj7zwvfg5luayideh73uqb2latkoyyy5h65y4atv3fymnlxlzwqd.onion\",\r\n    \"port\": 8333,\r\n    \"score\": 4\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n",

I feel that this encapsulates what you want to get across:\r\n\r\n#### Trade-offs of the `onlynet=onion` configuration option:\r\n\r\nThe privacy benefits of Tor are affected if a Tor-Bitcoin service node is reachable by IPv4/IPv6 nodes. Placing `onlynet=onion` in your bitcoin.conf file will ensure that your node only attempts to connect over the Tor network, thus maximizing the benefits of using Tor. The decision to use this option should consider the following trade-offs:\r\n\r\n**Sybil Attacks**\r\nWhile Sybil attacks are a threat on clearnet networks, it is of greater concern on the Tor network. A node that only maintains connections over Tor is vulnerable to a Sybil attack because of the minimal cost of creating a Tor address. This minimal cost means that an attacker can flood the network with thousands of apparent Tor-Bitcoin nodes controlled by the attacker.\r\n\r\nOne way to mitigate this is by leaving out the `onlynet=onion` configuration option, which will allow connections to IPv4/IPv6 nodes. Clearnet IPs have a greater creation cost, making it harder for an attacker to carry out a successful Sybil attack. \r\n\r\n**Network Partitioning**\r\nIf every Tor-Bitcoin node ran using the `onlynet=onion` configuration option, no Tor node would communicate with the clearnet network. This would result in the Bitcoin network becoming partitioned. For the health of the Bitcoin network as a whole, some nodes must communicate among both clearnet and Tor. You can help prevent this scenario by excluding the `onlynet=onion` configuration option. ",

If you are in an environment that does not permit direct Tor connections or the use of Tor bridges, then considering the trade-offs, it may not be safe to use the Tor network._\r\n\r\n> tor is no longer the only privacy network bitcoind can use, so for example, running onlynet=tor along with onlynet=i2p may be worth discussing.\r\n\r\nAgree Tor isnt the only option now but this PR and file `tor.md` is for Tor. \r\n\r\n> There may be reasons to prefer running both over onlynet=tor alone.\r\n\r\nMaybe\r\n\r\n",

Terminal applications are handiest when they're brief and easy to type.

Although a new follow up PR would be better to increase the probability of getting things merged soon and make it easier for people to review.\r\n\r\n> If we become Tor central is that bad?\r\n\r\nCan you explain this in detail?",

Add user to Tor group (\"satoshi\" in this example):**\n+\n+```\n+sudo usermod -a -G debian-tor satoshi\n+```\n+\n+**4. Restart System**\n+\n+```\n+sudo reboot\n+```\n+\n+**5. Edit Bitcoin configuration file**\n+\n+Open the `bitcoin.conf` file with your text editor.\n+Edit the file so that it contains these settings:\n+\n+```\n+listen=1\n+torcontrol=127.0.0.1:9051\n+debug=tor\n+```\n+\n+**6. Confirmation**\n+\n+You should be all set up to run a node through the Tor Network.\n+You can confirm that everything is set up correctly by running the `getnetworkinfo`\n+RPC command. The result should contain an address corresponding to your onion service:\n+\n+```\n+localaddresses\": [",

This example uses nano:\n+\n+```\n+sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc\n+```\n+Ensure that `torrc` has these settings, and save:\n+\n+```\n+ControlPort 9051\n+CookieAuthentication 1\n+CookieAuthFileGroupReadable 1\n+```\n+\n+**3. Add user to Tor group (\"satoshi\" in this example):**\n+\n+```\n+sudo usermod -a -G debian-tor satoshi\n+```\n+\n+**4. Restart System**\n+\n+```\n+sudo reboot",

It is essential that some nodes access both\n+  clearnet and Tor, or use `onlynet=i2p` with `onlynet=onion`.\n+\n+## Setup Guide: Debian/Ubuntu\n+\n+Assuming you already have an installation of Bitcoin Core:\n+\n+**1.

The example here is just the basic steps required to quickly setup Bitcoin Core Onion Service on Ubuntu without going in to details and skipping whole documentation or fix things in case confused after reading everything written above.\r\n\r\n_What?_\r\n\r\nThe goal here was to mention 3 examples: Ubuntu, Windows and Android similar to https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/98913/how-to-run-bitcoin-core-as-onion-service-on-windows-ubuntu-and-android/\r\n\r\n_Why?_\r\n\r\n1. There can be few users who refer to this doc but find everything mentioned confusing and give up somewhere in between or miss some important steps.\r\n2. We should avoid users searching for proper documentation in different websites, forums, blogs etc. and everyone should be able to follow the things easily using doc in this repository. Privacy should not be hard to achieve or at least the first steps should be easy and encouraging enough to motivate the user in learning more later.\r\n\r\nSo, the example is basically to skip all the things mentioned above. Run the commands and setup Bitcoin Core Onion Service in few minutes. Once the user can see that onion address and things working it will motivate him to read all the things mentioned in doc if interested to research more.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How?_\r\n\r\nI have added only Ubuntu in this doc because I was expecting if I try to add everything in one PR it will never get merged. I think I was wrong and PR is anyways not merged and its been months. So, I can add more things or look for more ACKs in this to get merged and do follow up PRs later.\r\n\r\nI can remove Line 293 and 294 if required to make the example even shorter and just the basic things one needs to try Bitcoin Core onion service quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
