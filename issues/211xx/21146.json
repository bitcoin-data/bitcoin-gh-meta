   "body" : "This PR is a subpart of #20833 which enables package validation through `testmempoolaccept`.\r\nThe first commit addresses some leftover comments from #21062.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen validating unconfirmed transactions, we want to account for all coins brought in from disk so we can uncache them if the tx is invalid. The disconnection of `CCoinsView`s right now doesn't quite achieve what's it's trying to do (prevent `MemPoolAccept` from unnecessarily accessing the coins cache and forgetting to uncache later). This PR improves it by doing 2 things:\r\n(1) Disconnect `m_viewmempool` from the coins cache when we don't need it to be connected.\r\n(2) Make `MemPoolAccept` destructor clean up after itself by uncaching coins accessed, instead of leaving it up to the caller. Only leave the coins cached when a transaction is accepted to mempool. In the future, if someone edits the `MemPoolAccept` class and forgets to consider uncaching, the default behavior is to uncache (which is safer).",
