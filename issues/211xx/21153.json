(I didn't receive Bitcoins for some years now.) Regardless of the Label, Message, or Checkbox values.\r\nWhen I create a new Wallet I can create new addresses. \r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\nI'm not able to reproduce this behavior with another Wallet.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nI was on version 0.18. So I upgraded to version 0.21. No change. \r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue? What is your operating system and its version? If Linux, what is your desktop environment and graphical shell? -->\r\nThe System is a PC with Windows 10 with an HDD for DB Storage.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\nI attached the debug.log shortened to on start and stop of the application.\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n![screenshot_20210211_123814](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12497441/107633654-ae346500-6c68-11eb-95b5-cf3f3c5a45b1.png)\r\n[debugDefault.log](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/5965013/debugDefault.log)\r\n",
