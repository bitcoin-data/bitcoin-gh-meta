Looking at the debug.log in the data directory, there are thousands of ListWalletDir: ACcess is Denied E:\\$Recycle.bin\\s-1-5-18 events. \r\n\r\nThe data directory is set to be the root of a USB drive mapped to the E: letter. \r\n\r\nClient is started as std user. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour is for the client UI to handle the access issue and continue, possibly noting the requirement to have further permissions. Even when the client is started as administrator, the same hang occurs.
