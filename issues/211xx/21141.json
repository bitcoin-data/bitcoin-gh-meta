   "body" : "This patch includes two new format placeholders for walletnotify:\r\n%b - the hash of the block containting the transaction (zeroed if a mempool transaction)\r\n%h - the height of the block containing the transaction (zero if a mempool transaction)\r\n\r\nI've included test suite changes to check and validate the above functional requirements as well as doc/help description changes.\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\nThe walletnotify option is used to be notified of new transactions relevant to the wallet of the node.\r\nA common usage pattern is to perform afterwards additional RPC calls to determine:\r\n1. If this is a mempool transaction or not (i.e. are there any confirmations?)\r\n2. What block was it included in?\r\n3. Did this transaction was seen before and is now seen again because of a fork?\r\n\r\nAll of these questions can be answered with the current features, but the resulting RPC calls may be expensive in a heavily used node. As this information is readily available when calling the walletnotify callback, it makes sense to save expensive round trips by optionally sending this information at that point in time. I can definitely say we would like to use it in Fireblocks, my employer.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know of any questions and suggestions.",
