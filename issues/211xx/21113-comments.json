I switched HDD and copied all data across, yet now the reindex command is taking forever.\r\n\r\nIt has been running for 2 hours so far, and i estimate 2 more hours to go to reach the height i was last at on my other HDD.",

Sorry im just a little stressed and tired, the machine has be running for 48 hours+ non stop on this subject and i have been awake for most of that time.\r\n\r\nYes you should sack Satoshi for bad coding he probably thought it would be a good encryption effect by randomising the blks yet on the long run it just makes it slower to synchronise files / transactions.\r\n\r\nOne more question before i go. Who started github.com/bitcoin if satoshi has been awol since 2009.\r\n\r\n",
