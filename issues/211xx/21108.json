(this is not a nfs resource)\r\nAll the blocks were fine in this directory.\r\nThe problem was that I was running the bitcoind service as root.\r\nEverything was going well.\r\n\r\nI then configured the service to run as a bitcoin group and user.\r\nI performed a **chown -R bitcoin:bitcoin /nfs2/blockchain**\r\nI restarted the OS and the service ran for a few hours to give me the errors as indicated above.\r\nI then restarted the service but the error always occurred after a few hours of execution.\r\nThen I completely deleted the contents of the /nfs2/blockchain directory\r\nI added the parameter to the bitcoind.conf file:  **debug=libevent, qt** \r\nI restarted the machine and since January 30 the service has not stopped.\r\n\r\nI would like to understand so as not to have to take over the entire blockchain again, which is what it is recommended to do.\r\nWhy when we change the user do we have this type of error?\r\nWhat should be done to stop having this type of error?\r\nWhat is recommended to do when the machine suddenly shuts down?\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
