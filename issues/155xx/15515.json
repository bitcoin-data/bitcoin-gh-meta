   "body" : "I don't understand why Bitcoin Core software was designed as a monolith and not as a microservices architecture.\r\n\r\nNow the node, the gui, the cli, the wallet are all in one. \r\n\r\nFor example, some people don't need the GUI, others don't need the CLI, or others don't need the wallet.\r\n\r\nFor example, some people can install a cli, set the node, and use it remotely, or some people can be take a wallet with a remote node.\r\n\r\nSo my question is, Why the core team deceided a monolith architecture? I don't find any reasonable fact for do this.\r\n",
