On one hand, that was a much harder break, on the other hand, it as a much smaller ecosystem at that time.\r\n\r\n> I'm somewhat disappointed to see that some parties that I've past identified as tech leaders still don't have sending support... which is an argument against rushing.\r\nBut maybe announcing a plan to default by version X might help some parties prioritize.",
