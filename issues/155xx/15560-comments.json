      "body" : "I worked pretty closely with the folks at BRD, who developed the whensegwit initiative, and I know they are keen on pushing the ecosystem toward widespread adoption of bech32 addresses. The first step for any service is quite clear - supporting sending to bech32 addresses, which is relatively easy to implement and does not introduce any complications for users. As noted by @gmaxwell, Core wallet has been able to do this since v0.16, and many other wallets support this too (whensegwit.com has a list).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is still far from 100% adoption and thus any service supporting bech32 receive addresses creates a risk of user confusion if the user attempts to send funds to a Core bech32 address from a wallet that doesn't support sending to bech32 (and thus would fail for the user). Optech is planning to research this further (similar to the RBF in the Wild research) to ensure the list is as comprehensive as possible. This will give services an idea of potentially how much user confusion might be created by generated bech32 receive addresses. Optech also does proactive outreach to services that don't yet support sending to bech32 addresses.\r\n\r\nThere are several UI options a wallet can consider for bech32 receiving addresses, depending on a number of factors such as how the wallet is marketed/positioned, how sophisticated its userbase is, its ability to handle customer service requests, and its attitude toward pushing for ecosystem wide adoption.\r\n\r\nUI options:\r\n1. Show only backwards compatible addresses. Wait to support receiving bech32 until broader adoption. [most conservative position]\r\n2. Show backwards compatible addresses by default. Separately show an \"advanced user\" option that provides sophisticated users the ability to generate a bech32 receiving address. As the user has to go out of their way to do it, the odds of them being confused if it fails and generated a customer support ticket is reduced. [fairly conservative position]\r\n3. Show bech32 addresses by default. Separately show a \"backwards compatible\" option that provides an escape valve in case a user is trying to send funds from a wallet that does not yet support sending to bech32 addresses. [more aggressive position]\r\n\r\nWhat is being proposed in this PR is option 3.\r\n\r\nThe team at Optech has a number of other ideas we're considering to help with adoption, and we will follow up here within a week proposing additional steps we can take to help with this. It is likely that some of our work will aid in determining which version of Core should adopt the more aggressive stance on receiving bech32 addresses.\r\n\r\n",

My reading of the conclusion was that the project commits to switch to bech32 receiving addresses by default for the 0.20 release but will optionally switch at the 0.19 release if project members believe there is enough bech32 sending support in other programs and services at that time that the change won't be needlessly disruptive to inexperienced Bitcoin Core users.\r\n\r\nSpecifically mentioned in this PR's OP is the project announcing this planned change, but I didn't see anything in the discussion about how the project planned to make that announcement.  Maybe a sentence in the 0.18 release notes or a post to the rarely-used [bitcoin-core-dev mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-core-dev)?",
