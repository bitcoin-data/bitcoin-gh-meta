This is a useful feature to have, as txids are used very frequently.\n\nThere are of course alternatives, such as computing the txid only on first use, or simply leaving the field mutable and making sure it's recomputed anytime before it's used. However, the current solution is safe, hard to screw up, and has no performance impact due to locking or atomics.\n\nFurthermore, in almost all performance critical parts of the code, transactions are immutable. Only in wallet signing related things they aren't.\n\nThere are also some vague future advancements like using blob allocation for transactions (all arrays/scripts allocated in a single allocated area) to reduce memory usage, which wouldn't apply to mutable transactions.",
