   "body" : "In preparation for descriptor based wallets (e.g. #15487) it's useful to distinguish between base58 and base32 addresses. One descriptor could be associated with `getnewaddress \"\" bech32` and another with `getnewaddress \"\" legacy` (which is interpreted as \"base58\", rather than as non-SegWit).\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new enum `AddressType`, along with a parser that returns an Optional. A new method `GetAddressType()` is added to `Descriptor` instances. The only purpose of `AddressType` is compatibility with other wallets, not a way to toggle SegWit.\r\n\r\nReusing `OutputType` would not be ideal for this, because the distinction between `OutputType::LEGACY` (`-addresstype=legacy`) and `OutputType::P2SH_SEGWIT` (`-addresstype=p2sh-segwit`) is irrelevant in descriptor based wallets. Instead, if someone does not wish to use SegWit, they can create a wallet with only a non-SegWit descriptor. \r\n\r\nThis is also useful for importing keys from a hardware wallet. In the current WIP #14912 there is a method `signerfetchkeys` which asks the device (driver) to return a set of descriptors. This returns e.g. three descriptors: one for BIP44 (legacy), one for BIP49 (p2sh-segwit) and one for BIP84 (native segwit). It can then associate the BIP84 descriptor with `getnewaddress \"\" bech32`.\r\n\r\nIt can then use either the BIP44 or BIP49 descriptor with  `getnewaddress \"\" legacy`. To distinguish those, this PR adds `IsSegWit()` to Descriptor instances.\r\n\r\nThe `boost/optional/optional_io.hpp` IO include allows for a more compact notation in the tests: `BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(ParseAddressType(\"bech32\"), AddressType::BECH32)`.",
