So it's probably more useful to discuss again when that's ready.\r\n\r\nThe use case here is that we obtain descriptors from a hardware wallet, e.g. via the HWI [getdescriptors](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/blob/d6799f366e5009ee637fac9acb075204d43e4c66/hwilib/cli.py#L147) call. This might be a mix of BIP44/49/84 descriptors. We then need to match those to the right output type in our wallet. That way if a user requests a legacy address, we give them a BIP44 derived address, vs. when they request a native segwit address, we'll give them a BIP84 derived address.\r\n\r\nIn order to match the right descriptor with the the right output type we need to parse it.\r\n\r\nI don't think it makes sense to start with a descriptor string, derive a random destination, get its script and then analyse that script to figure out if it's SegWit. The information is already in the descriptor string, so I think we should just use that.",

The GUI already behaves that way. \r\n\r\nA standard wallet would have two descriptors instead of three: native segwit and wrapped segwit. If someone doesn't want to use SegWit, they can create a wallet with a single P2PKH descriptor; such a wallet can only generate a base58 address.",
