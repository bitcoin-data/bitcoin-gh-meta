   "body" : "If I was to build bitcoin from scratch, I would probably define `CBlock` and `CTransaction`, and not `CBlock`, `CTransaction`, and `CMutableTransaction`; `CMutableTransaction` seems to me to be what should be `CTransaction` and `CTransaction` what should be `const CTransaction` just like there's `CBlock` and `const CBlock` and then there is `CTransactionRef` which could easily be made into `std::shared_ptr<const CTransaction>` (wait, I think it already is).\r\n\r\nThere's a bunch of code changes which concern themselves with that distinction, some rejected/closed, some merged:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14337\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14906\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14908\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14156\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13359\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13309\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a constant source of confusion and for unnecessary code churn. Would it not maybe be better to get rid of `CMutableTransaction` once and for all in favor of a clear distinction as in `CTransaction` and `const CTransaction`?",
