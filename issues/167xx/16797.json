   "body" : "#### When creating a `scripted-diff` commit, a developer currently needs to:\r\n- Locate and read the [Developer Notes on scripted-diffs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/doc/developer-notes.md#scripted-diffs)\r\n- Write a script\r\n- Debug it, possibly over multiple attempts\r\n- Add `scripted-diff: ` to the beginning of the commit message & PR title\r\n- Add the script(s) to the commit body\r\n- Add `-BEGIN VERIFY SCRIPT-` and `-END VERIFY SCRIPT-` around the script\r\n\r\nI found copying the above text into the editor during `git commit` to be a manual and repetitive part of building these commits.\r\n\r\n#### This approach allows a simpler workflow for testing, applying, and committing these scripts. A developer can now:\r\n- Create a working script file, e.g. `0.sh`\r\n- Run `0.sh` to apply the changes, `git diff` to examine them, and perhaps `git checkout` to refresh and retry over multiple attempts. When desired, `git add` the changes.\r\n- Run ```./contrib/devtools/commit-scripted-diff 0.sh \"docs: Rename X to x globally\"```\r\n\r\n#### Improvements that could be made to this script:\r\n- Further input validation\r\n- Run `test/lint/commit-script-check.sh` against the most recent commit(s)\r\n- Use `git commit -t <template_file>`, which would instead drop the user off in the editor at `COMMIT_EDITMSG` with pre-filled text. We would need to create `template_file` on the fly.\r\n- ~Add to Developer Notes and Devtools~\r\n- ~Copyright info~\r\n\r\nFeedback appreciated; thank you!",
