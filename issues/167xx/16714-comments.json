It stores it in a temp variable, resets the settings and then sets it again. I could do the same thing for `prune`, but keep in mind that the Intro dialog isn't always shown. So if the default data dir exists and you reset your settings, then prune would still be enabled. I'd rather turn it around and add an explicit setter for the datadir.",

It's easy to adjust the prune size in settings and the user has plenty of time for that during IBD.\r\n\r\nAlso note the diminishing returns for a larger prune setting. 10 GB protects you against a 1 month reorg if blocks are 4 MB. Pruned nodes only share the most recent 288 blocks ([BIP-159](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0159.mediawiki)). Maybe after #15606 we can add another network flag to indicate down to which UTXO snapshot we have blocks. At that point it makes sense to suggest prune sizes worth N years of blocks. Again, rather than explain all those trade-offs on the intro screen, we can just pick a good default and leave the rest to the settings screen.\r\n\r\n@luke-jr I think promag is talking about refactoring the intro screen so that it's better suited to handle more settings. In addition to that we could revamp the entire settings system, e.g. with your rw_config PR. I don't think this PR makes those efforts more difficult, or vice versa, so we can merge in any order. ",
