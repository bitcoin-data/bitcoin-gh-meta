If they dont do anything, I was thinking about removing them for linux and windows builds.\r\n\r\nSee the previews below.\r\n\r\n![file](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42591821/63705257-4728b380-c81c-11e9-8d84-42ed807b553d.png)\r\n![help](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42591821/63705258-47c14a00-c81c-11e9-8f64-8dff5277fe02.png)\r\n![settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42591821/63705261-47c14a00-c81c-11e9-8ae7-ecf707a46b5e.png)\r\n![window](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42591821/63705262-4859e080-c81c-11e9-9d92-05a1e1f7bdc6.png)\r\n",

On my text editor, close file has a document (no folder) with an X in the corner - but not sure if that's appropriate for a wallet.\r\n\r\nThe 'i' for Command-line options was hard to make out. I think it's too much serif for the size?\r\n\r\nFrom the main window (ie, not system-wide menu), Restore/Main Window seem like no-ops. I'm not sure how to best detect that, but it seems outside the scope of this PR. For icon-making purposes: Restore would un-minimise / bring to front, and Main Window would switch to the main window specifically.\r\n\r\nSending/Receiving addresses are too hard to differentiate. Maybe fill in the arrows and make them simpler?",

Working on the icons only to see the PR closed is a waste of time, can't argue with that.
