   "body" : "So I've had issues with the transifex organization for a whlie.\r\n\r\nA long time ago, the organization where the bitcoin project is under, [bitcoin](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin/), was created by a person named seone. They gave me and @luke-jr maintainer access to the project, but not full control over the organization.\r\n\r\nThis means I'm unable to access the [teams](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin/teams/) page, to make people translation coordinator and such, even though I get a lot of requests to do so.\r\n\r\nI've tried to contact seone in different ways but never heard anything back from them. If anyone knows them IRL or by another handle, please help contact them so that they can transfer the organization.\r\n\r\nIf not, I think the only sane thing to do is moving the translations to the [bitcoincore](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoincore/) organization (for which I have full access to organization settings, and which also has the translations for the bitcoincore.org website) for 0.19.\r\nThis will mostly involve updating some links, I expect.",
