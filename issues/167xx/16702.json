   "body" : "This PR attempts to solve the problem explained in #16599.\r\nA particular attack which encouraged us to work on this issue is explained here  [[Erebus Attack against Bitcoin Peer-to-Peer Network](https://erebus-attack.comp.nus.edu.sg/)] (by @muoitranduc)\r\n\r\nInstead of relying on /16 prefix to diversify the connections every node creates, we would instead rely on the (ip -> ASN) mapping, if this mapping is provided.\r\n\r\nA .map file can be created by every user independently based on a router dump, or provided along with the Bitcoin release. Currently we use the python scripts written by @sipa to create a .map file, which is no larger than 2MB (awesome!).\r\n\r\nHere I suggest adding a field to peers.dat which would represent a hash of asmap file used while serializing addrman (or 0 for /16 prefix legacy approach).\r\nIn this case, every time the file is updated (or grouping method changed), all buckets will be re-computed. \r\nI believe that alternative selective re-bucketing for only updated ranges would require substantial changes.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- more unit tests\r\n- find a way to test the code without including >1 MB mapping file in the repo.\r\n- find a way to check that mapping file is not corrupted (checksum?)\r\n- comments and separate tests for asmap.cpp\r\n- make python code for .map generation public\r\n\r\nInteresting corner case: Iâm using std::hash to compute a fingerprint of asmap, and std::hash returns size_t. I guess  if a user updates the OS to 64-bit, then the hash of asap will change? Does it even matter?",
