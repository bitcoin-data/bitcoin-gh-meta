Instead, I'd suggest that the proposed way of downgrading a wallet is by not upgrading. That means to create regular backups of the wallet and only upgrade after backing up the wallet.\r\n\r\nIn case we add auto-upgrade, there should be an option to disable auto-update (advertised in the release notes and command line option help).",
