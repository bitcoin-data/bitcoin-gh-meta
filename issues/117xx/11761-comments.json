In that case, would https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs be more appropriate?\r\n\r\nEither way, I don't think it should be too detailed, because then it won't be kept up to date. It should just be enough for a new developer - familiar with MVC, but not with QT - to get a sense of how the QT app is organized. More detailed descriptions can be inside individual source code files.\r\n\r\nSome documentation could be avoided by adding more directories and using more consistent file naming, but that's future work, I think. \r\n\r\n@fanquake the build instructions are currently separated per OS (Unix is the most detailed). They don't specify how to build bitcoin-qt only (without compiling tests). I could add that there, or I could add links to build instructions for specific parts of the application. Maybe there should be a common build instructions file (pointing to each OS-specific file), which lists the various config flags and explains how to build specific targets?",
