   "body" : "Prior to this commit callers of `FindNode(...)` were required to be holding `cs_vNodes` in the cases where they used the returned `CNode*` for anything aside from existence-checking (see #9626).\r\n\r\nThis resulted in locking `cs_vNodes` twice since `FindNode(...)` had a `LOCK(cs_vNodes);`.\r\n\r\nTo solve this and to make the locking requirements more explicit this commit does the following:\r\n* Add explicit locking requirements for `FindNode(...)` using `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_vNodes)`.\r\n* Remove the now redundant `LOCK(cs_vNodes)` in `FindNode(...)`.\r\n* Add a method `CConnman::NodeExists(...)` for existence-checking. Calling this method does not require holding `cs_vNodes`.",
