   "body" : "This PR changes the functional tests to have a consistent naming scheme:\r\n\r\n    tests for individual RPC methods are named rpc_...\r\n    tests for interfaces (REST, ZMQ, RPC features) are named interface_...\r\n    tests that explicitly test the p2p interface are named p2p_...\r\n    tests for wallet features are named wallet_...\r\n    tests for mining features are named mining_...\r\n    tests for mempool behaviour are named mempool_...\r\n    tests for full features that aren't wallet/mining/mempool are named feature_...\r\n\r\nRationale: it's sometimes difficult for new contributors to know what's already covered by existing tests and where new tests should be added. Naming in a consistent fashion makes it easier to see what's already covered at a glance.",
