      "body" : "@fanquake Thanks for reviewing. Good point. Would it be possible to state that locking requirement more explicitly using annotations (see #11226)? Perhaps one way to do it would be if the two uses were separated: `CNode* FindNode(Ã¢ÂÂ¦)` would require holding `cs_vNodes` (which would be clearly stated using `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_vNodes)`) whereas say `bool NodeExists(Ã¢ÂÂ¦)` wouldn't? Worth doing?",
