They are conjoined in the backend to provide ordering guarantees for listeners which are *both* mempool interfaces and validation interfaces, but are otherwise fully separated. There are a few cleanups that are enabled here, which I went ahead and did.\r\n\r\nb) fee estimator becomes a listener to the mempool interface which provides a bit of additional info about transactions being added more than just the tx (eg feerate, etc)\r\n\r\nc) a few minor edge cases in the fee estimator are handled (witness malleation changing feerate, and handling reorgs better, specifically).",
