If I `dumpwallet` and receive all my standard addresses, then `importwallet` on another bitcoin core and write a script that for each \"1\" address calls \"addwitnessaddress\" to generate a Segwit one - can I be certain that theses addresses will be the  same I used before? Can I workaround migrating seegwit addreses that way?",
