   "body" : "Splitting #11774 into two parts -- this part updates the README with the proposed naming convention, and adds some checks to test_runner.py that the number of tests violating the naming convention doesn't increase too much. Idea is this part of the change should not introduce merge conflicts or require much rebasing, so reviews of the complicated bits won't become invalidated too often; while the second part will just be file renames, which will require regular rebasing and will introduce merge conflicts with pending PRs, but can be merged later, and should also be much easier to review, since it will only include relatively trivial changes.",
