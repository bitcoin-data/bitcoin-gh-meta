What is the most appropriate way to solve that? I guess we don't want `extern CCriticalSection cs_main;` in `wallet.h`? :-)",

Indeed, obviously putting it in wallet.cpp is entirely useless, but it has only really marginal value. I'm open to discussion about whether its worth an extern CCriticalSection cs_main in wallet.h for this.",
