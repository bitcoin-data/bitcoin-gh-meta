   "body" : "This change is intended to make the bitcoin node and its rpc, network and gui interfaces more responsive while the wallet is in use. Currently, because the node's `cs_main` mutex is always locked before the wallet's `cs_wallet` mutex (to prevent deadlocks), `cs_main` currently stays locked while the wallet does relatively slow things like creating and listing transactions.\r\n\r\nSwitching the lock order so `cs_main` is acquired after `cs_wallet` allows `cs_main` to be only locked intermittently while the wallet is doing slow operations, so the node is not blocked waiting for the wallet.\r\n\r\nTo review the present PR, most of getting right the move is ensuring any `LockAssertion` in `Chain::Lock` method is amended as a `LOCK(cs_main)`. And in final commit, check that any wallet code which was previously locking the chain is now calling a  method, enforcing the lock taking job. So far the only exception I found is `handleNotifications`, which should be corrected.",
