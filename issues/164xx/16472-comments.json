Setting up and hosting a small Gitlab/Gitea instance is quite easy, however, one facilitating a large project like this would see a lot of traffic and visitors and probably get a lot of hack attempts, too. It will not be a small job to manage this. \r\n\r\nThere's also the issue of trust. Github has been, at least up to now, a reasonable neutral third party. The one running the server could be tempted to manipulate reviews / ACKs or discussion, for example. Github could also do this but we've always assumed they don't have the incentive, whereas someone close to the project might.\r\n\r\nAnother reason to use signed ACKs, I suppose.",

For paying/providing such a mirror I would think that many companies and individuals would do that if it is easy enough.\r\n\r\nWithout thinking to deep about if it is feasible what about:\r\n\r\n1st step:\r\nHaving a one or many GitLab instances as a read-only mirror directly from GH would still be helpful?\r\n\r\n2nd step: \r\nBuild something like GitLabs enterprise edition called [Geo](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/geo/) but open source. To be able to have few servers sync from GH directly but many to sync from other GitLab mirrors.\r\n\r\n3rd step:\r\n(no idea how) make that sync a 2-way-sync (across all mirrors) so that it does not matter on which GitLab host you enter a comment, review or pr, they all sync up in a few minutes. You would still have some troubles if one mirror gets hacked but maybe there is also a good risk/reward ratio to make this feasible. When working, ditch GH.\r\n\r\nMake it easy like BTCPayServer (or maybe like Debian mirrors) to install and sync up and distribute the repo across many peers.",
