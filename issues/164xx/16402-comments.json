Or perhaps we can simply have the same defaults for mainnet and the test chains for wallet arguments, since testers can set them to whatever they want manually anyway. Perhaps the extra complexity is not worth it in this case.\r\nEither way, I don't see how this helps towards that goal of separating the wallet.",
