   "body" : "Running the test coverage analysis, currently (as of commit 67923d6b3c1e4413570ef34a53a5b1b441814bc6) 42% of functions are not covered. As a first issue for me, I'd like to start with writing tests and, naturally, I'd like to focus on code for which they're really needed - on the most critical code that lacks coverage. Is there perhaps available a list of source files (or higher granularity units of code, e.g. classes, functions) lacking coverage and sorted by how critical it is to have it?\r\n\r\nOf course, being more familiar with the code base would answer my question, but in order to be more familiar, I feel like I need to write tests for existing code, so it's the chicken and the egg...\r\n\r\nAlso, as something that I believe could contribute to increasing the coverage, what do you think of making the lcov results accessible online and have it updated on every build of the master branch? That can be later tweaked to display the code that lack coverage sorted by priority, so that striving contributors could have a meaningful starting point.",
