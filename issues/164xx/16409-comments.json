And assuming that miners are running with mempool expiry to support your use case, they have no way to protect against the case where they are sent a replacement transaction that has *less* fees. (Expiry will completely erase the tx and any feerates associated with it)\r\n\r\nIf you look at use cases that have been observable on the current network, my change seems like a clear improvement: Assume that a tx hasn't confirmed after 2 weeks, so the original wallet has a few options:\r\n\r\n* 1) No rebroadcast to \"cancel the tx\" (https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bitcoin+cancel+tx)\r\n* 2) Rebroadcast to explicitly keep it alive\r\n* 3) Broadcast a replacement tx with:\r\n a) less fee\r\n b) marginally more fee (your use case)\r\n c) more fee\r\n\r\nWith my proposed changes:\r\n\r\n* 1) Miners have no incentive to throw away income, so this gives a false sense of security and my changes would make it explicit that the tx is still alive.\r\n* 2) Rebroadcasting might hurt privacy and imposes a cost on the network, so might as well keep the tx in the first place (as is done with my changes)\r\n* 3) .\r\n a) Again, miners don't have an incentive to throw away income, so this is fragile. My changes would prevent it from happening\r\n b) Imo a theoretical use case. If miners are willing to accept marginally more fee they can reduce the `-minincrementalfee`. And I think a fee decay should be done in a follow up pull request. Though, I am happy to \"drop this minimum marginal rate rule\" as suggested by you, if others think this is helpful.\r\n c) Bad actors on the network can starve propagation of those txs by just flooding out the original tx. Again, my change would prevent that from happening.",
