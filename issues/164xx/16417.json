   "body" : "Describe the issue:\r\n--------------------------\r\nBitcoin-Qt freezes on start-up, giving two transparent windows. I suspect it's related to my system clock changing (more details below). This means the issue is not caused by the Bitcoin Core software but, I'm submitting it anyway because the error could maybe be catched and handled more graciously. Even crashing in a secure way would be better: when this happens I'm kinda scared to kill the process and mess the blockchain. \r\n\r\nWhat behaviour did you expect?\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nBitcoin-Qt should start normally.\r\n\r\nWhat was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)?\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe program freezes giving a transparent Bitcoin Core window and another transparent Bitcoin - Warning window. Screenshot for reference:\r\n![Screenshot_2019-07-18 Screenshot at 2019-07-18 14-52-13 png (PNG Image, 1920 Ã 1080 pixels) - Scaled (86%)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18300485/61480532-8d147100-a96c-11e9-9487-86cd3e84dfb5.png)\r\n\r\nHow reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so?\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWhen I start my computer on linux after I've been using windows (it's dual boot), the OS changes the system clock seconds after entering the desktop, syncing with some internet time server.  Around 30% of the times, this produces the issue. I suspect the time change in the middle of the initialization makes the software freak out.\r\n\r\nIt should also occur with any other kind of use that makes the system clock change inmediatly after boot but I mention this details because I think it's a very common use case. I think I could try to manually reproduce the error consistently by changing the system clock on the BIOS if needed.\r\n\r\nWhat version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)?\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nI believe I installed it from my package manager. It was either that or downloaded from website.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)?\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nuname -a says: Linux [removed host name] .0-54-generic #58-Ubuntu SMP Mon Jun 24 10:55:24 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the GUI-related issue on Linux provide names and versions of a distro, a desktop environment and a graphical shell (if relevant).\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nLinux Mint 19\r\nMate 64-bit\r\n\r\n\r\nAny extra information that might be useful in the debugging process.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nLogs confirm it's clock related: \r\nhttps://pastebin.com/ni7bWgL9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand that this issue occurs in very very specific circunstances and it's ok if fixing it is not a priority. If you consider this to be important and it could use a fix, I would be happy to try to investigate it further and submit a PR.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and for the hard work mantaining this.\r\n",
