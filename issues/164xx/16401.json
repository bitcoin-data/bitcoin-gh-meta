   "body" : "Accepting a single transaction to the mempool only succeeds if (among other things) the feerate of the transaction is greater than both the min relay fee and the mempool min fee. Consequently, a transaction below the minimum fee may not be accepted to the mempool, even if we later learn of a transaction with a high fee that depends on it.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds code to validation that will accept a package of transactions to the mempool under the following conditions:\r\n\r\n- All package transactions must be direct parents of the final transaction.\r\n  This is a simple heuristic for ensuring that a candidate list of transactions\r\n  is in fact a package (we wouldn't want arbitrary transactions to be paying\r\n  for random low feerate transactions)\r\n\r\n- The feerate of the package, as a whole, exceeds the mempool min fee and the\r\n  min relay fee.\r\n\r\n- No transactions in the mempool conflict with any transactions in the package.\r\n  This is a simplification that makes the logic easier to write. Without this\r\n  requirement, we would need to do additional checks to ensure that no parent\r\n  transaction would evict a transaction from the mempool that some other child\r\n  depends on.\r\n\r\n- The ancestor/descendant size limits are calculated assuming that any mempool\r\n  ancestor of any candidate transaction is an ancestor of all the candidate\r\n  transactions.\r\n  This allows for doing simpler calculations to ensure that we're staying\r\n  within the mempool's package limits. If we eliminated this, we would need to\r\n  do much more careful package calculations for each candidate transaction and each\r\n  in-mempool ancestor.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds code to net_processing that will attempt to process transaction packages in one narrow case: if a transaction fails to get into the mempool due to insufficient fee, but has an orphan in the orphan pool, then we will try to process the pair together to see if they can be accepted as a package.\r\n\r\nThis PR is definitely WIP, but I'm opening it as a proof-of-concept motivation for refactoring ATMP (#16400).",
