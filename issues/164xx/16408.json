   "body" : "Related to: #16150\r\n\r\nWe noticed that we could build QT without using XLib/libX11 as a library. XLib/libX11's headers are still used, and a minimal `configure.ac` has been added to eliminate overly-enthusiastic configure-time dependencies that aren't actually required to obtain the headers.\r\n\r\nThis also means that we eliminate XLib/libX11 as required shared libraries at runtime, which is desirable.\r\n\r\nSee commit messages for more details.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nReviewers: I am least sure about the minimal `configure.ac`, as I'm not too familiar with the autoconf syntax. Any improvements w/re robustness would be welcome.",
