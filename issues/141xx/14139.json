   "body" : "For #14138 I took a look at `encrypted_batch` in the wallet code.  My understanding may be incorrect, as the code around it is undocumented and quite messy.  But as far as I understand, `CWallet::encrypted_batch` is only used in these places:\r\n\r\n* The destructor, simply to free it.\r\n* `AddKeyPubKeyWithDB`:  If not set initially, it is set to the passed-in reference and reset to `nullptr` before exiting the function.\r\n* `AddCryptedKey`:  It is read if non-null, not changed.\r\n* `EncryptWallet`:  It is expected that `encrypted_batch` is null initially.  Then it is set to a newly allocated object, used, feed and reset to `nullptr` again before exiting the function.\r\n\r\nTo me, it seems that there is no way through which `encrypted_batch` can be non-null except temporarily while executing either `AddKeyPubKeyWithDB` or `EncryptWallet`.  Thus I feel like this can be cleaned up and clarified quite a bit.  For instance:\r\n\r\n* Make it explicit that the member variable / `CWallet` instance never owns the associated memory; it is just a simple reference passed down to `AddCryptedKey`.\r\n* Accordingly, do not do anything about it in the destructor.\r\n* Use a `std::unique_ptr` on the stack in `EncryptWallet` to hold the memory.\r\n\r\nOne could even go a step further and use RAII to set/restore `encrypted_batch` in both `AddKeyPubKeyWithDB` and `EncryptWallet` rather than doing it in the current \"unsafe\" way.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something here, or is my understanding correct?  If it is, then I'm happy to prepare a clean up PR for this.",
