Reduce the complexity of the build system by a lot (making it easier to maintain and adjust over time)\r\n2. Reduce the amount of stuff to maintain (i.e. MSVC stuff).\r\n3. Can show actual real superiority over the current build system (highly doubt that can be the case).\r\n\r\nA nice feature but I don't think that's enough to switch is somehow faster builds. ",

Most of the discussion is about switching the current msvc build (which is for developer convenience only and never used to build official binaries) to cmake. That would be possibly be a minor improvement to the current msvc build config and Visual Studio does now have [cmake support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019). Without a PR, even it was for only one of the libraries, this issue is a bit academic.",
