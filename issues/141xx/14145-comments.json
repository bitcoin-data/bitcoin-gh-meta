      "body" : "The goal of the HWI project is to facilitate this. The fact that it is written in python is irrelevant. It is a program that can be invoked by Core (e.g. fork and pipe) whenever something involving hardware wallets needs to be done. It abstracts away all of the device specific driver stuff so users (and Core) only need to know some basic commands in order to do anything. HWI can also have its own UI for interacting with hardware wallets for things like pin entry.\r\n\r\nThe idea that I had was that we would include HWI in the binary distribution (maybe separately?) but in a place that Core would know where to find it. Then when a hardware wallet thing needs to happen, it would just call HWI which would do whatever command and Core would get the result back as a JSON string.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWith #14019, #14021, and #14075, you can use a hardware wallet with Core via HWI. The process is very manual, but it certainly is doable and not as bad as one might think.",

We could e.g. add descriptor arguments to `createwallet`. This would require changes to the wallet format so it can handle a root `xpub` (instead of `xpriv`) and arbitrary derivation descriptors for receive and change addresses.

TL&DR:\r\n* Python script gets a bunch of addresses from the device, e.g. `m/44'/0'/0'/0/[0-99]`\r\n* add keys to keypool using RPC; the above output is easy to copy-paste. Needs #14075 to make keypool work with watch-only wallet.\r\n* to receive coins, no hardware wallet needed, just generate addresses (legacy, p2sh, bech32) as usual\r\n* to send coins, generate a PSBT and pass that into the python script (needs #14021 to keep track of BIP32 paths), device signs it, and script returns PSBT, which you then parse and broadcast with RPC\r\n\r\nReview of #14019, #14021, and #14075 would be quite helpful to move this forward. In addition, @ken2812221's #13966 makes these watch-only wallets more pleasant to look at in QT. ",
