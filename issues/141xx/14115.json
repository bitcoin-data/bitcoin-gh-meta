   "body" : "The linters are thoroughly tested under Ubuntu which is what we use in Travis. When reading #14041 I understood that some developers were experiencing problems when running the linters on their local machines.\r\n\r\nAssuming these local machines were running macOS I installed a fresh macOS VM, followed the instructions in `build-osx.md` and ran the linters.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the changes needed to make `lint-all.sh` run as expected.\r\n\r\nIdeally the linters would continuously run also under a Travis macOS environment to make sure we catch these kind of issues before merge.",
