   "body" : "This splits our Qt build in depends into two parts. The first builds `qmake`, qt tools (`uic`, `moc`, `rcc` etc) as well as translation tools (`lconvert`, `lupdate` etc). The second builds the libs we want for `bitcoin-qt`.\r\n\r\nSplitting the build in this way has a few advantages. For example, we can enable the xml module while building the tools, and ideally fix issues like #14648 or #18536 without needing changes like #21589 or #21420, or having to build it alongside our libs.\r\n\r\nThis has been tested a little bit. GUIX builds are working for macOS and Windows.\r\n\r\nSome testing still needs to be done in regards to passing compiler flags, DEBUG=1 builds etc. No doubt some improvements can still be made to what is currently here.\r\n\r\nFixes #18536.",
