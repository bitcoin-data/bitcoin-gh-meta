   "body" : "Both tests `mempool_packages.py` and `mempool_package_onemore.py` define a utility function `chain_transaction` with a similar implementation. This PR deduplicates it by moving it into the util package and keeping the more general properties:\r\n* pass a list of parent_txids/vouts instead of single values\r\n* always mark the BIP125-replaceable flag for txs, created via `createrawtransaction` (this is needed by the `mempool_package_onemore.py` test, but doesn't hurt the other one)\r\n\r\nThis is a low-hanging fruit; as a potential follow-up one could probably also deduplicate the function `chain_transaction` in `rpc_packages.py`, which looks a bit different, as it also takes the parent locking script into account and doesn't send the tx.",
