Just to be clear about the previous comment https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22183#issuecomment-856259151, I am saying I think the overlap between two PRs actually not so great, and my first suggestion there to avoid adding lots of new references to `gArgs` variable and instead pass `*context.args`, should be applicable with or without #19101. My second suggestion would just be to resolve the few conflicts there are between this PR and #19101 where #19101 adds `WalletContext&` parameters and this PR adds `ArgsManager&` parameters by favoring #19101 to avoid code churn. (This could also be rebased on top of #19101 to accomplish the same thing)",

WalletContext is container for multiple wallets, and only meant to be used by RPC code and init code, not meant to be used by core wallet code. An individual CWallet is only meant to have access to the state it needs: a chain interface pointer, maybe an argsmanager pointer, it's own database, not to the list of other wallets or other global state. WalletContext is analogous to NodeContext. NodeContext is meant to be used by init and rpc code, not by validation code. Most normal code should not depend on or have access to the global state in these context structs.",
