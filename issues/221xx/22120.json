   "body" : "(Luke) was unsure if the code sufficiently avoided caching a\r\ntime-too-new rejection, so wrote this test to check it.  It looks like\r\ndespite only exempting BLOCK_MUTATED, it is still okay because header\r\nfailures never cache block invalidity.  This test will help ensure that\r\nif this ever changes, BLOCK_TIME_FUTURE gets excluded at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis PR re-opens https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17872 which went stale and addresses the nits raised by reviewers there.",
