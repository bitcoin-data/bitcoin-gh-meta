Bitcoind can also create a tor hidden service automatically (with `-listenonion`) but those two are not exclusive. Specifying both will not cause an error, it will just result in two hidden services.\r\n\r\n> Seperately (Yes, no not support questions..) is it also necessary to -setexternalip= for Bitcoin Core to your onion service at command line / in bitcoin.confas the linked document suggests, even when using 'ephemeral' hidden service working with AddLocal message?\r\n\r\nThe automatic hidden service will automatically be regarded as local address and thus gossiped. Unless you override the external IP with `-externalip`, in which case I think you do need to specify it because that overrides the automatic setting.",

Not even a new logfile notice is written.\r\n\r\nI have tried stopping `bitcoin-qt`, then stopping Tor, uncommenting the relevant hidden-service lines in `/etc/tor/torrc`, and then attempting to restart Tor. No success - just in case it was a port bind conflict or something similar.\r\n\r\nThe hidden-service lines exactly match the format of the example hidden-service lines in the default `torrc` file.\r\n\r\nI have thoroughly reviewed the standard `torrc` examples and notes. I have used [nyx](https://nyx.torproject.org/) to explore all Tor options and cannot locate either error in the config lines or additional options to assist.\r\n\r\nIn the pull request edit to `/doc/tor.md` I have only noted under the intro to section 2:\r\n>*For Tor version 0.2.7.0 and older versions of Tor only as it is redundant in newer versions.*\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is since manually setting up the hidden service in Tor is no longer necessary with newer versions of Bitcoin Core used with newer versions of Tor, and the document already notes this in section 3. Besides that, the edits to `torrc` breaks things. The use of the options listed in the next part of section 2 are still valid, but are once again redundant as Bitcoin Core does all of the necessary steps automatically.\r\n\r\nBTW in what release version of Bitcoin Core was Tor control first included? I saw somewhere a mention of v0.7.0 ?",
