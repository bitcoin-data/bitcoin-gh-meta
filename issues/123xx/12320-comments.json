It is quite common for not-a-virus detections and so on to be added for packages that a corporate network would likely want to be alerted to if it were present on their network. Trojan flags, on the other hand, are a definite FP by individual AV vendors. It would be more correct to say that some AV vendors are not careful or specific enough narrowing down their detections. They can easily add it to their database as FP to prevent further detections once they are communicated with. Also, some vendors do not wholly develop their own detections signatures, just copying when they can the detection signatures of others (to grow their database without needing to see or investigate samples).\r\n\r\nYou can see in the behaviour tab some of the trojan matching behaviours. While it may be possible to remove or change this behaviour if it is not necessary to be precisely as it is, such a change should not be necessary as the release version can be cleared with AV vendors if necessary before release to prevent FP's.",
