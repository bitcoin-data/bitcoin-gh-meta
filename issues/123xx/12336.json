   "body" : "There were some RPC/RPC options deprecated in v0.16. Those can now be removed from master since v0.16 has been branched.\r\n\r\n- `estimatefee` RPC has been removed. The `feature_fee_estimation.py` test has been updated to remove the RPC, but doesn't yet have good coverage of the replacement RPC `estimatesmartfee`. Improving the test coverage should be done in a new PR. (#11031)\r\n- the `errors` field returned by `getmininginfo` has been deprecated and replaced by a `warning` field. (#10858)\r\n- providing addresses as inputs to `createmultisig` has been deprecated. Users should use `addmultisigaddress` instead (#11415)\r\n- The return format from `addmultisigaddress` has changed (#11415)\r\n\r\n`getwitnessaddress` was also deprecated in v0.16 and can be removed, but many tests are using that RPC, so it's a larger job to remove. It should be removed in a separate PR (possibly after #11739 and #11398 have been merged and the segwit test code tidied up)",
