Bitcoin-cli could integrate the pinentry process and use a `-insecure` option if one wants to use `walletpassphrase` with the insecure passphrase parameter. Using it on pure RPC level is another things (we don't want to handhold there).\r\n\r\n* Similar to the point above, I think it should be integrated into bitcoin-cli (not another executable, if, then combined with other wallet functions, see #8745)\r\n\r\n* If not integrated, could this be something that would be better in the contrib/ folder since there are other ways how to do this securely (see @ryanofsky comment)\r\n\r\n* Also, using external software for passphrase entry would move a critical part further away from our controlled stack (shell is not in our controlled stack, so not sure if this is an argument).\r\n\r\n* If this gets added to the main binaries, disable it by default (via configure.ac) for the first (or the first two) releases would probably make sense, since this is security critical and deserves more field test before defaulting to true.",
