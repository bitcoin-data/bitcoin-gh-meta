So, decided not doing that.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm now thinking it's actually not such a good idea to implement new RPC if there are no other use cases for it. But probably this issue could be kept open, if somebody comes up with them in future.\r\n\r\n> Not sure about the use_bnb option.\r\n\r\nProbably not a good idea to export such option via RPC, as different coin selection algorithms may come and go in future.",
