   "body" : "`BlockManager` is a large data structure, and `cs_main` is not required to take its address or access every part of it. Individual `BlockManager` fields and methods which do require `cs_main` like `m_block_index` and `LookupBlockIndex` are already annotated separately, and these other annotations describe locking requirements more accurately and do a better job enforcing thread safety.\r\n\r\nSince `cs_main` is not needed to access the address of the m_block object, this commit drops `cs_main` LOCK calls which were added pointlessly to satisfy this annotation in the past.\r\n\r\nCode changes were made by dongcarl, I just wrote the commit description",
