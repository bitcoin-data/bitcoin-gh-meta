   "body" : "`PoissonNextSend` and `PoissonNextSendInbound` are used in the p2p code to obfuscate various regularly occurring processes, in order to make it harder for others to get timing-based information deterministically. \r\n\r\nThe naming of these functions has been confusing to several people (including myself, see also #23347) because the resulting random timestamps don't follow a Poisson distribution but an exponential distribution (related to events in a Poisson process, hence the name). This PR\r\n- moves `PoissonNextSend()` out of `net` to `random` and renames it to `GetExponentialRand()`\r\n- moves `PoissonNextSendInbound()` out of `CConnman` to `PeerManager` and renames it to `NextInvToInbounds()`\r\n- adds documentation for these functions \r\n\r\nThis is work by jnewbery - due to him being less active currently, I opened the PR and will address feedback.",
