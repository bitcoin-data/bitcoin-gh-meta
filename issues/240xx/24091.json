   "body" : "While working on coin selection code, it occurred to me that `CInputCoin` is really a subset of `COutput` and the conversion of a `COutput` to a `CInputCoin` does not appear to be all that useful. So this PR adds fields that are present in `CInputCoin` to `COutput` and replaces the usage of `CInputCoin` with `COutput`.\r\n\r\n`COutput` is also moved to coinselection.h. As part of this move, the usage of `CWalletTx` is removed from `COutput`. It is instead replaced by storing a `COutPoint` and the `CTxOut` rather than the entire `CWalletTx` as coin selection does not really need the full `CWalletTx`. The `CWalletTx` was only used for figuring out whether the transaction containing the output was from the current wallet, and for the transaction's time. These are now parameters to `COutput`'s constructor.",
