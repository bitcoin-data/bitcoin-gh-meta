   "body" : "Now that the GUI has been split up into its own monotree about 2 years ago (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19071), it could make sense to start a discussion to do the same to the wallet.\r\n\r\nJust like the GUI, the wallet is speaking with the node via internal interfaces. However, the wallet is still \"baked into\" large parts of the codebase that shouldn't really depend on it. (E.g. the tests: #20078). Also, if people think that splitting the GUI (#19071) had negative effects, we should hold back on doing the same to the wallet and circle back.\r\n\r\nOther than that, the goals and considerations remain largely the same (see #19071 for details):\r\n\r\n* Separate issue and patch management\r\n* More focused review and interests\r\n* Maintain high quality assurance\r\n* The wallet *is* Bitcoin Core",
