In short, it\r\n- only emits existing ValidationInterface events for the active chain,\r\n- introduces a BackgroundBlockConnected event for the background chain to support indexation, and\r\n- removes assumptions in the indexing framework that indexation will happen sequentially.\r\n\r\nMore details below.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdds BackgroundBlockConnected to the validationinterface and uses it in\r\nindex maintenance. Ensures that index building will work when part of\r\nthe chain is validated asynchronously in the background by a second\r\nchainstate.\r\n\r\nThis changeset removes the guarantee that indexes will be built\r\nsequentially, as none of the current indexes require this and it is no\r\nlonger easy to offer this guarantee when multiple chainstates are in\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nWithin BaseIndex, we only update `m_best_block_index` (which is\r\nessentially the progress marker for how far along the indexing process\r\nis) for chains which we can be certain that all blocks under a given\r\nblock on that chain have had indexing performed on them.  In other\r\nwords, we will not update `m_best_block_index` during a BlockConnected\r\nevent that comes from an active snapshot chain, i.e. a chain for which\r\nsome of the blocks underneath Tip() are not indexed.\r\n\r\nOnce background validation is completed and no background chainstates\r\nare in use, the indexer will happily use BlockConnected events from the\r\nactive chain to update `m_best_block_index` as usual. No blocks from the\r\nactive chainstate will have been missed for indexing (despite not\r\npreviously updating m_best_block_index), so it is safe to perform this\r\ntransition without any extra behavior.\r\n\r\nSome unnecessary logic from BaseIndex::ChainStateFlushed() is removed,\r\nsince the locator can no longer be assumed to be an ancestor of the\r\nbest_block_index (since the \"best block\" may be on a background chainstate\r\nand the locator may have come from an assumed-valid tip well ahead of\r\nit).",
