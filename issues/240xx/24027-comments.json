Attempting to do so would earn you orders of magnitudes less than the cost of electricity and wear and tead to your hardware, so Bitcoin Core does not support doing so. You need custom hardware (called ASICs) to do that.",

If it can't succeed with that, it returns an error. It \"works\" the same way on mainnet too, it's just an incredible waste of time to try.
