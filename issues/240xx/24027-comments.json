That's a whole lot different than saying the Bitcoin Core doesn't allow CPU mining by throwing errors in the absence of an ASIC.\r\n\r\nThis code is incredibly efficient with optimizations such as avoiding greater / less than comparisons on each iteration and decreasing memory usage with 1-digit numeric variable names.\r\n\r\nThe hard part is forming a valid block with the documentation available.\r\n\r\nIs the RPC block submission process broken? Is mining resource usage an excuse to force proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-work? Is someone going to stop me before I mine a block? Will I win the lottery and lose interest in code?
