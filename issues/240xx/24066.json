   "body" : "When other initscripts depend on bitcoind, it's because their daemons want to be able to invoke `bitcoin-cli` or to communicate with bitcoind via RPC. That can't happen until some time after bitcoind has forked into the background when it is started with the `-daemon` option. The `-daemonwait` option was added in 92cf3a22e (#21007) to address exactly this issue, so let's use it.\r\n\r\nTo avoid blocking startup for arbitrarily long, as users would be annoyed if `agetty`/`display-manager` doesn't start quickly, we now mark the `bitcoind` service initially as inactive at startup and then call back to OpenRC to mark the service as started (and proceed to start any dependent services) after bitcoind forks into the background.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a replacement for withdrawn PRs #22285 and #22354.\r\n",
