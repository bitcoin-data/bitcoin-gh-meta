   "body" : "This does the minimal effort to generate a libbitcoinscript.so which can VerifyScript, though nothing else is exposed.\n\nBuild with ./configure --enable-shared=yes and you'll find a libbitcoinscript.so installed (or in src/.libs).\n\nIt weighs quite a bit, but it works, so I think its worth merging and then trimming down (and adding features) as we go (Ive already got one or two others ready, but first things first).\n\nPlease do not ACK this unless you've verified there are no changes before/after the copy/paste.\n",
