I'd rather keep what it does and how it exposes functionality as stripped down as possible. For instance I'd add this to python-bitcoinlib by making VerifyScript call this library behind the scenes, retaining the Python code for non-consensus-critical work. \n",

I could #ifdef that part out, if y'all prefer, but I want to atleast get script things properly separated and then separate out the other crap later as possible.\n\n@sipa: In the future, I'd hope that bitcoind just uses libbitcoinscript as a static link, so it makes sense to include the exposed file. I agree that the cache flag (and others in the future) dont make any sense to expose (hell, cache isnt even built in...), so I moved that one to script.h.\n\n@petertodd I agree, do you have any ideas for names that arent ridiculously long?\n",

We've never installed headers, so that's not a one-line fix.\n\nI spent a good chunk of the day working on getting exports working properly. It was simple for Linux, but it's going to be quite complicated for windows/osx. We have no infrastructure for building shared libs there, so it's going to require a re-working of dependencies and build-scripts to get non-Linux platforms in place.\n\nOSX dylib builds, but it needed -lcrypto to link. key.cpp and script.h pull in some symbols. I'm not sure why Linux works, presumably the linker is smart enough to drop the unused paths. Windows needs a bunch of work.\n\nSo, NACK on anything but code movement until the aspects of building/distributing shared libs have been properly evaluated. I'm certainly volunteering to help get those things in order, but I don't like the idea of treating master as a feature branch.\n",

It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5.

Since a consensus library won't include networking code in it, I see no harm in ensuring that the SPV-consensus part of that library can be used as-is; most likely the natural path of development will make it so anyway.\n",
