Because this doesn't happen, an empty addresses file is written.\n- Same for `mempool` fee estimation logic. Because this doesn't happen, an empty fee estimates file is written.\n- `boost::filesystem::remove(GetPidFile())` should only be called if we created the PID file in the first place. But more is wrong here, the PID file is _created_ in bitcoind.cpp far before the datadir lock is checked.\n\nWe should add a comment to Shutdown() that it must handle cases in which AppInit2() failed partway.\n",
