This is not correct - such functionality never existing, and whenever you typed \"bitcoind [command]\", it always needed to find a running daemon to talk to. This did not change, only the ability to send commands elsewhere was moved from bitcoind to bitcoin-cli. \n\nHowever, very recently a new command was added (bitcoin-tx; not in a release yet), which allows for some simply offline transaction manipulation, without assistance from a bitcoind. It cannot manipulate your wallet though, just individual transactions.\n",
