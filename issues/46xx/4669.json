   "body" : "I've found that peers.dat gets wiped out from time to time, manifesting as \"Loaded 0 addresses from peers.dat  <n>ms\" when it previously had hundreds of peers recorded.  I've associated this power outages/kernel oopses, but seen it more often.  I think I've tracked this down: [`StopNode()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.9.2/src/net.cpp#L1760) calls `DumpAddresses()` but doesn't account for how we started up.  When we'd started up and found `.lock` held, we reach `DumpAddresses()` with zero peers and dump an empty database, overwriting the good one.\n\nIt's easy to forget about `.lock` after an outage.  When you're tinkering and `bitcoin-cli stop` and hastily relaunch `bitcoind`, which I used to do before I realised (a) that `bitcoin-cli stop` is asynchronous, and (b) just how slow shutdown can sometimes be on my hardware, you trigger the same thing, which I think accounts for every other time I've seen it.  Probably annoys me more because working Tor HS peers are harder to find.\n\nMaybe it's as simple as wrapping the dump in `if (addrman.size() != 0) { ... }`, but I haven't tested it.\n",
