A zen balance must be achieved.  :)  For the GUI, with massive additional dependencies and compiled modules, it makes a lot of sense.\n\nThe default, on the other hand, should be to avoid adding options without good reason.  I would rather fix a bug, normally, than add a --paper-over-bug option that is very rarely used, in highly unusual and soon fixed scenarios.\n\nIn theory, every additional option increases the test matrix.  Removing options reduces complexity.  In this case, admittedly, it is a very tiny marginal move.\n",

The issue is that there are countless packaging systems (and devs) that rely on the canned: ./configure --with-foo --disable-bar && make && make install. When you can disable binaries via configure, that all works with no further intervention. With the option removed, there's no way to avoid packaging the unwanted binaries other than postprocessing.\n\n@laanwj Yea, that's what we should've done from the start :. I think a one-time move would probably be reasonable... distros like gentoo are going to have to update their build recipes to cope with the new binaries anyway.\n\n@luke-jr I must run 'make bitcoind' 100 times per day, for just about every conceivable build config. No problems here. If it's not working for you, please create a bug report as I wasn't aware of any brokenness.\n",
