In practice, due to the boost bug, that'd mean that we have to export all functions that may need to catch a boost exception. Imo that's not reasonable, especially since it's due to a faulty lib.\n\nThis wouldn't affect any of our final releases, though, as they're all built with a static boost.\n\nI would very much like to see this enabled by default as well, but it would mean refusing to build against boost < 1.49. I'd be much more comfortable with enforcing that restriction at some point in the future than trying to work around it by manually exporting many unrelated functions now.\n\nThe third option would be detecting the boost version and selectively enabling reduced exports, but I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with that either.\n",

I'm not sure a link test would be enough though, I think we'd actually have to dump the resulting symbols and verify (as opposed to a try_run which would break on cross).

I dug around for a bit and it looks like preciseâs default linker (bfd) has busted support for ââexclude-libs ALLâ. Most distros these days have switched to gold anyway. I installed that and it worked as it shouldâve.\n\nSo basically, all is good if you add âbinutils-goldâ to the packages list in the descriptor. Iâll add that into my PR on monday after verifying that it's still deterministic.\n\nScript output from gitian looks like this:\n\n```\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test_bitcoin-qt: export of symbol _edata not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test_bitcoin-qt: export of symbol _end not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test_bitcoin-qt: export of symbol _init not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test_bitcoin-qt: export of symbol __bss_start not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test_bitcoin-qt: export of symbol _fini not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bitcoin-cli: export of symbol std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > std::operator+<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >(char const*, std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&) not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bitcoin-cli: export of symbol std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > std::operator+<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >(std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&) not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bitcoin-qt: export of symbol _edata not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bitcoin-qt: export of symbol _end not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bitcoin-qt: export of symbol _init not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bitcoin-qt: export of symbol __bss_start not allowed\n/home/ubuntu/out/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bitcoin-qt: export of symbol _fini not allowed\n```\n\nLooks like thereâs a single bug in that versionâs libstdc++ that causes the strings to be visible, but thatâs nothing to worry about (and it's obviously been fixed since, since it doesn't show up for me locally).\n\nSo as far as Iâm concerned, the visibility changes here are enough to get us what weâre after, assuming the deps/tools arenât busted. Using the gold linker for precise seems to be all it takes to work around.\n",
