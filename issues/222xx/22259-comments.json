General bitcoin questions and/or support requests are best directed to the [Bitcoin StackExchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com) or the `#bitcoin` IRC channel on Libera Chat.\r\n\r\nNonetheless some notes:\r\n\r\n* The Bitcoin Core major version 0.17.x is officially no longer supported. See https://bitcoincore.org/en/lifecycle/#schedule . It is recommended to read the release notes of newer versions, test them in a test deployment and then move production to supported versions.\r\n* \"Converting\" nested addresses to native ones is not supported either. It is recommended to ask the wallet to generate native addresses for you. I don't know how you produce addresses, but if you use `getnewaddress`, then https://bitcoincore.org/en/doc/0.21.0/rpc/wallet/getnewaddress/ is the documentation. ",
