   "body" : "This change lets IPC serialization code handle FoundBlock arguments more simply and efficiently. Without this change there was no way to determine from a FoundBlock object whether a block was found or not. So in order to correctly implement behavior of leaving FoundBlock output variables unmodified when a block was not found, IPC code would have to read preexisting output variable values from the local process, send them to the remote process, receive output values back from the remote process, and save them to output variables unconditionally. With FoundBlock.found method, the process is simpler. There's no need to read or send preexisting local output variable values, just to read final output values from the remote process and set them conditionally if the block was found.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10). The commit was first part of larger PR #10102.",
