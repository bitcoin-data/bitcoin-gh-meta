Notice the IP\n+address and port the SAM proxy is listening to. Usually that is\n+`127.0.0.1:7656`. Once it is up and running with SAM enabled, the following\n+Bitcoin Core options can be used to engage with it:\n+\n+```\n+-i2psam=<ip:port>\n+     I2P SAM proxy to reach I2P peers and accept I2P connections (default:\n+     none)\n+\n+-i2pacceptincoming\n+     If set and -i2psam is also set then incoming I2P connections are\n+     accepted via the SAM proxy. If this is not set but -i2psam is set\n+     then only outgoing connections will be made to the I2P network.\n+     Ignored if -i2psam is not set. Listening for incoming I2P\n+     connections is done through the SAM proxy, not by binding to a\n+     local address and port (default: 1)\n+```\n+\n+In a typical situation, this suffices:\n+\n+```\n+bitcoind -i2psam=127.0.0.1:7656\n+```\n+\n+The first time Bitcoin Core connects to the I2P router its I2P address (and\n+its corresponding private key) will be automatically generated and saved in a\n+file named `i2p_private_key` in the Bitcoin Core data directory.\n+\n+## Additional configuration options related to I2P\n+\n+You may set the `-debug=i2p` config logging option to have additional\n+information in the debug log about your I2P configuration and connections.\n+\n+It is possible to restrict outgoing connections in the usual way with\n+`-onlynet=i2p`. Notice that, I2P support being new (as of 2021), there are not\n+as many I2P peers as Tor or IP ones. So using `-onlynet=i2p` may make a node\n+more susceptible to\n+[Sybil attack](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#Sybil_attack). Use CLI\n+`-addrinfo` to see the number of I2P addresses known to your node.\n+\n+## I2P related information in Bitcoin Core\n+\n+There are several ways to see your I2P address in Bitcoin Core:\n+- in the debug log (grep for `AddLocal`, the I2P address ends in `.b32.i2p`)\n+- in the output of RPC `getnetworkinfo` in the \"localaddresses\" section\n+- in the output of the CLI `-netinfo` peer connections dashboard\n+\n+To see to which I2P peers your node is connected, use `bitcoin-cli -netinfo 4`\n+or the RPC `getpeerinfo` (e.g. `bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo`).",

Notice the IP\n+address and port the SAM proxy is listening to; usually, it is\n+`127.0.0.1:7656`. Once it is up and running with SAM enabled, use the following\n+Bitcoin Core options:\n+\n+```\n+-i2psam=<ip:port>\n+     I2P SAM proxy to reach I2P peers and accept I2P connections (default:\n+     none)\n+\n+-i2pacceptincoming\n+     If set and -i2psam is also set then incoming I2P connections are\n+     accepted via the SAM proxy. If this is not set but -i2psam is set\n+     then only outgoing connections will be made to the I2P network.\n+     Ignored if -i2psam is not set. Listening for incoming I2P\n+     connections is done through the SAM proxy, not by binding to a\n+     local address and port (default: 1)\n+```\n+\n+In a typical situation, this suffices:\n+\n+```\n+bitcoind -i2psam=127.0.0.1:7656\n+```\n+\n+The first time Bitcoin Core connects to the I2P router, its I2P address (and\n+corresponding private key) will be automatically generated and saved in a file\n+named `i2p_private_key` in the Bitcoin Core data directory.\n+\n+## Additional configuration options related to I2P\n+\n+You may set the `debug=i2p` config logging option to have additional\n+information in the debug log about your I2P configuration and connections. Run\n+`bitcoin-cli help logging` for more information.\n+\n+It is possible to restrict outgoing connections in the usual way with\n+`onlynet=i2p`. Notice that, I2P support being new (as of 2021), there are not\n+as many I2P peers as Tor or IP ones. So using `onlynet=i2p` may make a node\n+more susceptible to\n+[Sybil attacks](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#Sybil_attack). Use\n+`bitcoin-cli -addrinfo` to see the number of I2P addresses known to your node.\n+\n+## I2P related information in Bitcoin Core\n+\n+There are several ways to see your I2P address in Bitcoin Core:\n+- in the debug log (grep for `AddLocal`, the I2P address ends in `.b32.i2p`)\n+- in the output of RPC `getnetworkinfo` in the \"localaddresses\" section\n+- in the output of `bitcoin-cli -netinfo` peer connections dashboard\n+\n+To see to which I2P peers your node is connected, use `bitcoin-cli -netinfo 4`\n+or the RPC `getpeerinfo` (e.g. `bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo`).\n+\n+To see which I2P addresses your node knows, use the RPC",
