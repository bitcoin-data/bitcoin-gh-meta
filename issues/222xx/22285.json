   "body" : "When other initscripts depend on bitcoind, it's because their daemons want to be able to invoke `bitcoin-cli` or to communicate with bitcoind via RPC. That can't happen until some time after bitcoind has forked into the background. The `-startupnotify` option was added in 090530cc24 (#15367) to support exactly this use case, so let's use it.\r\n\r\nThe ideal OpenRC mechanism of marking the service inactive at startup and later calling back into the `start()` function with `IN_BACKGROUND=yes` won't work here because bitcoind runs as an unprivileged user that is not allowed to call `rc-service ${SVCNAME} start`, and OpenRC has no mechanism like `systemd-notify`, so instead we make `start-stop-daemon` lock a startup dummy file with `flock(1)` before exec'ing `bitcoind`, and then we use `-startupnotify` to release the lock when bitcoind is ready to service RPC requests. In the initscript's `start_post()` function we lock the startup file briefly, which forces that function to wait until bitcoind has released its lock on the file, which will happen when bitcoind either executes the `-startupnotify` command or dies. After acquiring and releasing the lock, `start_post()` performs one final check that the pid file still exists, which allows the service to be marked as started or stopped appropriately.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst.

Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",
