It doesn't seem necessary to me, but also doesn't seem harmful. \r\n\r\n> though it's not clear to me how a node would signal it doesn't want to receive address messages at all.\r\n\r\nHave you seen #21528?

      "body" : "The `sendaddrv2` message has a very clear purpose - to announce that the peer who emitted it supports the `addrv2` format (and obviously prefers to receive `addrv2` instead of `addr`). This is [documented in BIP155](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0155.mediawiki#signaling-support-and-compatibility). If the semantic of `sendaddrv2` is to be changed, that should start by modifying BIP155. There must be a very compelling reason (as @jonatack mentions above) to change it, given that its already deployed and running on mainnet. Tweaks to address relay is not such a reason, IMO.\r\n\r\nThere already was a [discussion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/907#issuecomment-686044611) whether to add extra meaning in `sendaddrv2` before it was introduced (whether to tie it to relay/not-relay). It [concluded like this](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/907#issuecomment-694471696).\r\n\r\nOn the organizational level - I think it is not a good idea to rush such a change to the code _and the protocol_ near or past the feature freeze (this PR was opened a few hours before FF).\r\n\r\nOn the technical level - I think it would be most simple and flexible to introduce a new flag \"I (don't) want unrequested addresses\". This could be done with either a new message or a service bit. Having two separate flags for the supported format (`A`) and the desire to receive gossip (`B`) would allow all 4 combinations, let's say:\r\n\r\n* `A` - support for `addrv2` (currently equal to sending `sendaddrv2`)\r\n* `B` - want unrequested addresses\r\n\r\n1. `!A` and `!B` (it follows that if you send me a reply to my `getaddr` it should be in the old `addr` format because I don't support the new `addrv2`)\r\n2. `!A` and `B`\r\n3. `A` and `!B` (it follows that if you send me a reply to my `getaddr` I prefer it to be in the `addrv2` format)\r\n4. `A` and `B`\r\n\r\nSignalling \"I want unrequested addresses\" (`B`) could mean that I either maintain an address database and/or participate in gossip. Which one it is (or both) is irrelevant to my peer who only needs to know whether to gossip to me or not.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17194 is related, cc @naumenkogs ",

I think both PRs should be considered together. The change in semantic is because, e.g. `getaddr` is changed from \"give me some addresses\" to \"give me some addresses and I participate in address relay, so if you send me addresses now or unrequested later I promise to further relay them to others, I am not a black hole\".\r\n\r\n> It's simply changing the Bitcoin Core node behavior to not send a message that is irrelevant. If we ignore all addr messages on a connection, then there's absolutely no point in sending a message on that connection which says \"please send addrs in such-and-such format\".\r\n\r\n`sendaddrv2` does not say that, see the top of this post. But anyway - looking at this PR in isolation could be misleading as the big picture is in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21528.\r\n\r\n> > The intention is to say \"send me red apples instead of green apples (if you are going to send me any apples at all)\", not to mandate whether I want apples or not.\r\n> \r\n> This doesn't make sense to me. Why would I say \"send me red apples instead of green apples\" when I don't eat apples at all and I'm going to put all the apples in the trash?\r\n\r\nYou may be eating apples after all. What if we look beyond the Bitcoin Core's block-relay mode? There may be a case where one does not want unrequested address messages, but could send `getaddr` and wants replies to that to be in `addrv2` format. This cannot be done with your interpretation of `sendaddrv2`, this PR and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21528.\r\n\r\n> To summarize what the current behavior is for block-relay-only connection:\r\n>     * we make a connection out to the peer\r\n>     * we send a `sendaddrv2` message\r\n>     * the peer sends us `addrv2` messages\r\n>     * we ignore those `addrv2` messages\r\n> \r\n> after this PR:\r\n>     * we make a connection out to the peer\r\n>     * the peer sends us `addr` messages\r\n>     * we ignore those `addr` messages\r\n> \r\n> There's essentially no change to our addr processing. The only change for the peer is that they'll serialize addresses as `addr` instead of `addrv2`. There are no implications or changes to the protocol.\r\n\r\nI agree that this PR alone looks innocent, but then if we are to look at this PR alone, the change is also pointless, so why do it?",

      "body" : "@vasild Am I correct in interpreting your position this way: address gossip is considered to be a well-defined aspect of the P2P protocol, and given that #21528 is changing the semantics of a number of messages, including `sendaddrv2`, that change matters. It's not specifically this PR you're concerned about, but the fact that 21528 is changing semantics (which this PR relies on), and those semantics don't match BIP155.\r\n\r\nIf so, I'd counter with my view that addr gossip is only a local policy choice that every client makes, and is (so far) not the subject of any BIP at all. Network rules are defined by more than just BIPs, and expectations of network nodes matter just as much. However, in this case, given the fact that lots of actually deployed nodes on the network don't and never have participated in addr gossip at all, I think it's fair to say that choosing to not do so isn't much of a break. Because of that, I think that these PRs are best seen as only changing heuristics about what and where to relay addresses. Perhaps going further than earlier heuristics we had, but still, clients are free to relay whatever they want or nothing at all. It's not related to BIP155, because that BIP specifies addrv2 relay and announcing support for it; the choice of gossip or not is outside of its scope.\r\n\r\nI do think the lack of clarity in the situation is unfortunate, and could be improved if someone wants to put in the work of analyzing the goals and expectations of address gossip, by writing up a specification for messages for explicitly opting in or out of address relay. That would supersede all this. I don't think it's necessary to formalize this aspect of the protocol before being able to make improvements, though.\r\n\r\n> The change in semantic is because, e.g. getaddr is changed from \"give me some addresses\" to \"give me some addresses and I participate in address relay, so if you send me addresses now or unrequested later I promise to further relay them to others, I am not a black hole\".\r\n\r\nI think that interpretation is inaccurate. There is no expectation of not black holing. Even if you see it as a specification change, at best it means \"I want to be served addresses\" - the receiver is free to use them directly or not, put them in a database or not, relay them or not, or none at all and just drop them. The aim of 21528 is just not knowingly relaying to those who don't care about addresses anyway. If an attacker wants to be an intentional black hole, they can keep claiming they want addresses and ignore them.\r\n\r\n> You may be eating apples after all. What if we look beyond the Bitcoin Core's block-relay mode? There may be a case where one does not want unrequested address messages, but could send getaddr and wants replies to that to be in addrv2 format. This cannot be done with your interpretation of sendaddrv2, this PR and #21528.\r\n\r\nI think that's fine. It's a heuristic and it is expected that there can be situations where it is overly conservative. Receiving gossip is the status quo, so when there isn't a signal to infer the other party isn't interested in it, we should assume that they want it. There is no harm done, because it's the same as we do now. Nothing here prevents or worsens the ability for an actual protocol message from explicitly opting out of gossip, if that were desirable.\r\n\r\nWould it ease your concerns if the interaction with `sendaddrv2` was removed (i.e., this PR closed, and `sendaddrv2` removed from triggering gossip in #21528)? My understanding is that it is only added for consistency reasons to 21528, and that that necessitates this PR. The advantages of the current approach are that the heuristic is more conservative, so (even) less likely to miss situations where gossip is desired, and more consistent (\"you're doing something related to addr relay, you probably care about gossip\"). On the other hand, if sendaddrv2 is excluded, this PR isn't necessary, and block-only connections from 0.21 nodes will also get the benefit. Perhaps that makes sense; it's treating sendaddrv2 purely as a configuration setting then, and to opt into gossip, you have to actually ask or send addresses.",

My understanding is that it is only added for consistency reasons to 21528, and that that necessitates this PR. \r\n\r\nMy take is that the approach in #21528 â of inferring addr relay heuristics from observed messages to improve network behavior â is conceptually fine, now that weâve put the work in to minimize the chance that the changes there could break other software, but that changing the way we send `sendaddrv2` to try to achieve some perceived consistency with the legacy addr messages is purely an aesthetic choice and not a functional one. So overall I think this choice doesnât matter much, but it does seem both aesthetically and functionally worse to me that weâd stop sending this message as proposed here, because (a) there is some benefit as @jonatack mentioned for measuring deployment of BIP 155 by always sending and (b) even aesthetically I think that itâs better that signaling of support for addrv2 should be orthogonal to addr relay negotiation itself, so in the future when I hope someone proposes some more comprehensive addr relay protocol I think we will just want to uncouple these things anyway. In general I think we donât want to have complicated interactions to reason about when different combinations of p2p messages are sent, and BIP 155 is nice and simple as it is.\r\n\r\nAnother way of putting it is if you think of the heuristics of #21528 as a sort of hack to achieve better addr behavior in the absence of protocol support for the functionality we want, then keeping that hack as small as possible seems best. I donât think anyone believes that implicit behavior (that is undocumented in any BIP) is the right way for protocol development to proceed if starting from a clean slate â so eventually I think weâll rewrite things.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps that makes sense; it's treating sendaddrv2 purely as a configuration setting then\r\n\r\nThis is precisely how I see it. (Again though I think it doesnât matter very much, this seems like mostly an aesthetic debate, though I do think this proposal is slightly worse than the alternative of leaving this logic unchanged.)\r\n",

      "body" : "Everybody, thanks for your comments! I read everything carefully, slept over this and the following scenario came to my mind:\r\n\r\n`A` (outbound, blocks only) -> `B` (inbound)\r\n\r\n* `A` does not send `sendaddrv2` (because it is blocks-only, due to this PR)\r\n* `A` does not send `getaddr` (because it is blocks-only, as in `master`)\r\n* `B` sends `sendaddrv2`\r\n\r\nSo `B` thinks that `A` does not support `addrv2`. Later `B` requests some addresses from `A` via `getaddr` (yes, Bitcoin Core does not send `getaddr` in incoming connections, but another software, or a modified Bitcoin Core may do) and gets an `addrv2` response, which comes as a surprise because `A` never announced support for `addrv2`. Currently this would not have happened because `A`, being in blocks-only mode would ignore the `getaddr` from `B`. I would say it is better to make sure we never send `addrv2` if we did not announce our support for it via `sendaddrv2`, but I see this PR is now closed, so that is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, I came to the realization (or delusion) that just `getaddr` is enough for the purposes of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21528, will continue the discussion there.",
