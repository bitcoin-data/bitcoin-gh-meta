   "body" : "There are still many functional tests that perform conversions from a hex-string to a message object (deserialization) manually. This PR identifies all those instances and replaces them with a newly introduced helper `tx_from_hex`.\r\n\r\nInstances were found via\r\n* `git grep \"deserialize.*BytesIO\"`\r\n\r\nand some of them manually, when it were not one-liners.\r\n\r\nFurther, the helper `ToHex` was removed and simply replaced by `.serialize().hex()`, since now both variants are in use (sometimes even within the same test) and using the helper doesn't really have an advantage in readability.
