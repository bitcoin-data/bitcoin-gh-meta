   "body" : "**RPC**\r\nThis makes bech32m the default whenever possible. For legacy wallets the default remains bech32. Same for descriptor wallets without an active Taproot descriptor.\r\n\r\n**GUI**\r\nA new wallet setting allows users to opt-in to Taproot. If they opt in, the GUI bech32 checkbox now produces either bech32 or bech32m depending on the wallet. This avoids having to explain the difference.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"591\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2021-10-20 om 20 13 17\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/138150773-353bd519-56b2-4b24-a2a0-998778cc56ab.png\">\r\n\r\n**Considerations**\r\nThis lets users and developers experiment with taproot wallets. When merged before #22364, the user will have to manually import a taproot descriptor. After that PR, taproot descriptors will be present for all new wallets.\r\n\r\nIt is better to stick to bech32 addresses for the time being, because:\r\n1. It is expected that it will take a while for enough wallets and exchanges to correctly handle sending to bech32m addresses\r\n2. Taproot savings for a single signature wallet are not huge\r\n3. Explaining the difference between bech32 and bech32m is not great UX\r\n\r\nBut we don't want to prevent users and developers who _do_ understand the difference to use Taproot. Without this PR they can only do this via the RPC (`getnewaddress some_label bech32m`). With this PR it's a simple checkbox.\r\n\r\nChanging the RPC default to bech32m seems acceptable to me, since those users will have a better understanding of the wallet. Though I can see the case against it because it might be a breaking change, e.g. if someone has an automated setup that creates new wallets (existing wallets currently don't auto upgrade to taproot, so their behavior is not changed). \r\n\r\n**Suggested testing**\r\n* call `getnewaddress` without type and `getnewaddress Test bech32` / `bech32m`\r\n* create a receive address in the GUI with and without the bech32 checkbox\r\n1. Legacy wallet\r\n2. Default descriptor wallet (current does not have taproot descriptor)\r\n3. Wallet with taproot descriptor:\r\n   * build #22364 \r\n   * create new descriptor wallet\r\n   * build this PR again",
