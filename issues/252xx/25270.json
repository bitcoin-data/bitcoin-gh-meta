   "body" : "**Context**\r\nI have multiple accounts on the same box that need to run clients of bitcoind. In particular it's LND and electrs. Bitcoind itself runs in a separate account. I have other accounts that I don't want to have access to bitcoin: e.g. Grafana (graphs/charts web UI). So, the cookie file can be shared amount the relevant accounts via a group. On the file system a group read permissions can be set on each file.  I call the group \"bitcoinclients\". I setup a directory where new files will inherit the bitcoinclients group and will be created with the u=rw,g=r,o= permission. This means bticoin account can write the file, bitcoinclinets group can read it, and no one else has access.\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe problem is that when `bitcoind` is restarted it drops the group read permission on the cookie file so clients in other unix accounts can't read the file.\r\n \r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThere should be a config that allows controlling permissions of the cookie file. Just a boolean that sets the read permissions on the group would be sufficient.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI setup a [chronos workaround](https://github.com/alevchuk/minibank/blob/first/bitcoin/README.md#bitcoin-cookie) but I bet more people will have to re-invent this wheel as the cookie file gets wider adoption.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n[Cookie file](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/25ad2c623af30056ffb36dcd203a52edda2b170f/src/httprpc.cpp#L252) has [more security](https://github.com/Kixunil/security_writings/blob/master/cookie_files.md) over user+password auth. User+password auth is being deprecated in favor of the cookie file.",
