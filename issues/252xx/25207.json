   "body" : "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am getting an error when building bitcoin-master\r\n\r\nduring make, it fails with:\r\n\r\nCXX ipc/capnp/libbitcoin_ipc_a-protocol.o\r\nipc/capnp/protocol.cpp:7:10: fatal error: ipc/capnp/init.capnp.h: No such file or directory\r\n7 | #include <ipc/capnp/init.capnp.h>\r\n| ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\ncompilation terminated.\r\n\r\nI pulled git clone from the source repository here on github. My make procedure for capnproto was as per the instrucions in capnproto/c++\r\n\r\nArchitecture x86_64 Debian 11 + Kali Linux 2022.1\r\nGCC-11 and GCC-12 system compilers\r\nEverything is largely up to date and most dependencies should be in place.\r\n\r\nI also had issues trying to follow bitcoin recommendations of running MULTIPROCESS=1 (with capnproto and libmultitool still on my system, not yet uninstalled) as per docs here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ac219dcbcc18a48210d58cdfaf7cf27ca5e7435b/doc/multiprocess.md\r\n\r\nPlease advise as this is outside my field of knowledge as per why this file would be missing when doing make.\r\n\r\nI had a lot of difficulty with libmultiprocess not uilding with the debian package on capnproto, and debian needs to update capnproto as well, on a side note, to fix atomic and libatomic being requested in CapnProtoConfig.cmake by default. Thankfully the master tree here had not issue, but being on an x86_64 system, it was troublesome having the debian package request atomic, I tried installing libatomic as a dependency. Master tree here on github installed both capnproto and libmultitool with no issue.\r\n\r\nBut something doesn't want to add up for make on the bitcoin master.\r\n\r\nI will note, bitcoin was configured with:\r\n\r\nCONFIG_SITE=\r\n\r\n{BDB_PREFIX}/lib -ldb_cxx-4.8\" BDB_CFLAGS=\"-I${BDB_PREFIX}/include\" --enable-wallet --enable-usdt --with-qrencode --with-zmq --with-mpgen=yes --with-sqlite3 --with-gui --with-miniupnpc --with-natpmp --enable-hardening\r\n\r\nafter\r\n\r\ncd <BITCOIN_SOURCE_DIRECTORY>\r\nmake -C depends NO_QT=1 MULTIPROCESS=1\r\n\r\nI also reproduced the same error configuring with:\r\n\r\n./configure BDB_LIBS=\"-L\r\n\r\n{BDB_PREFIX}/include\" --enable-wallet --enable-usdt --with-qrencode --with-zmq --with-mpgen=yes --with-sqlite3 --with-gui --with-miniupnpc --with-natpmp --enable-hardening --enable-multiprocess\r\n\r\nand previously I had the same issue",
