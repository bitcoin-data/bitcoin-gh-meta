Internally, since we do care very much about dependencies though, it maybe be good to let some warnings trigger errors, particularly security warnings like this one.\r\n\r\nIn this case it's probably worth looking into the warning to see if it's real. I believe this warning is about printing a c string with `printf(c_str)` instead of `printf(\"%s\", c_str)`, which can be a bad thing to do.\r\n\r\n",
