It's mentioned in the PR description to not generate confusion: This was built on top of #25005 because needed the structure introduced in 5b6124da to implement this flow properly. (where \"properly\" means not doing an ugly workaround and be able to place the new code on top of a cleaner structure)\r\n\r\nNow that #25005 got merged, will rebase it and get rid of all the extra commits.",

But.. for that, we need #25601 which introduces the generic error functionality.\r\n\r\nBut aside from that (which I think that would be a good long term goal), maybe might worth to continue with the PR as is now, primarily because it's unifying the errors that we throw on the GUI and on the RPC server.\r\n\r\nStill, have to say that I would like to be able to move this kind of errors from the wallet sources to a class that lives on an upper layer like the wallet interface. So GUI and RPC receive the same errors and the wallet isn't in charge of describe this type of errors for the user.",
