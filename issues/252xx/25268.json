   "body" : "This PR splits out the eviction logic into its own component `EvictionManager`. In addition to isolating the eviction logic, we get rid of several layer violations (e.g. `CConnman::ForEachNode/ForNode` calls, `CNode::m_last_block_time`, etc.) between `net` and `net processing`.\r\n\r\nOne instance of the `EvictionManager` is created at start up and passed as a reference to the connection and peer managers. The connection and peer managers report all eviction relevant information to the eviction manager who ultimately suggests nodes to evict as the result of `EvictionManager::SelectInboundNodeToEvict` and `EvictionManager::SelectOutboundNodesToEvict`.",
