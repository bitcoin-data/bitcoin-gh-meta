   "body" : "### Context\r\n\r\nInside time consuming operations, that take place reiteratively for a prolonged time, we are not flushing to db on every new record or state update (avoiding single disk write operations and batching them instead).\r\nFor instance:\r\n1) When the wallet scans the chain (during sync or rescan), looking for new \"own\" transactions.\r\n2) When the wallet is being loaded; which, in case of having conflicting transactions, requires to update the tx and its descendants states.\r\n\r\n### Main Problem\r\n\r\nWe are actually flushing to db directly, no batching, on both processes under some circumstances:\r\n\r\n- For the chain synchronization/rescan process:\r\n    - We are flushing to db every time that the process founds an output, that belongs to the wallet, when it address is not inside the address book.â¨\r\n\r\n- For the transactions loading process:\r\n    - We are flushing to db every time that we update the spent outputs map, to unlock the coin, and when the transaction being loaded conflicts with another transaction.\r\n\r\n### Extra Problem\r\n\r\n- In several places across the wallet flows, we create new `WalletBatch` objects. Which, internally, mean:\r\n\r\n    1. Increase the db references number and try to open the db.\r\n    2. And a disk read operation of the âversionâ field.\r\n\r\n \tFor example, along `AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe`, a new `WalletBatch` object is internally created every time that `MarkConflicted`, `SetAddressBook` and `AddToWallet` are called.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nThis should bring us a good speedup of the wallet synchronization, rescan and load processes.\r\n",
