I have ran into a make host issue while doing the steps needed to compile Bitcoin on my computer. Below is a screenshot of the situation and the steps detailed I used to get this program working. For another reference, I followed the steps to compile Bitcoin from these links: \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-windows.md#building-for-64-bit-windows\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/depends/README.md\r\nThe screen shot below shows everything else. Thank you for your time.\r\n![New Bitcoin issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42873006/170236050-1605460f-15b5-4ebc-9ee3-507762db8693.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTo compile normally to finish compiling the core on my laptop\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nA makefile error\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nI am using Bitcoin Core 23.0\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nI am using Windows 11 as my operating system and WSL for the terminal.\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue?
