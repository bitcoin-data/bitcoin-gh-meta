   "body" : "Follow-up work to my comment in #25239.\r\n\r\nGuarding and alerting the user about a wallet invalid state during chain synchronization.\r\n\r\n#### Explanation\r\nif the `AddToWallet` tx write fails, the method returns a wtx `nullptr` without removing the recently added transaction from the wallet's map.\r\n\r\nWhich makes that `AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe` return false (even when the tx is on the wallet's map already), --> which makes `SyncTransaction` skip the `MarkInputsDirty` call --> which leads to a wallet invalid state where the inputs of this new transaction are not marked dirty, while the transaction that spends them still exist on the in-memory wallet tx map.\r\n\r\nPlus, as we only store the arriving transaction inside `AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe` when we synchronize/scan block/s from the chain and nowhere else, it makes sense to treat the transaction db write error as a runtime error to notify the user about the problem. Otherwise, the user will lose all the not stored transactions after a wallet shutdown (without be able to recover them automatically on the next startup because the chain sync would be above the block where the txs arrived).\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nOn purpose, the first commit adds test coverage for it. Showing how the wallet can end up in an invalid state. The second commit corrects it with the proposed solution.",
