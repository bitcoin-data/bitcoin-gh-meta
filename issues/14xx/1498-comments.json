All networks such as garlicat and onioncat are encoded by using reserved space in ipv6 addresses.\n2. Bitcoin nodes relay addresses to everyone, ipv6 addresses are relayed to ipv4 nodes etc (changing this is non-trivial)\n3. Cjdns uses an enormous amount of ipv6 space.\n\nBitcoin nodes will relay cjdns addresses to other nodes so if another network came along which uses the fc space, there would be a space collision. In theory cjdns is stealing a vast amount of space and is a relatively unpopular network. In practice if the space were used by multiple networks, the effect would be nodes attempting to connect to other nodes but being in the wrong network. Imagine some other network using the fc space, cjdns nodes would transfer the addresses to that network's nodes which would then try to connect to them, not knowing they are not from their own network.\n\nIn the long term, there will probably be a network ID attached to addresses which identifies them so not all networks need to be represented as IPv6 addresses.\n\nMy position:\n1. It's ok in practice because for now no other such networks exist and if one were added then it would be a performance degradation issue, it would not be impossible.\n2. If there's a network ID then the problem is solved.\nIt still adds a certain amount of difficulty for the developers and in _theory_ it's bad so it should not be merged unless a \"good\" number of people want to run bitcoin/cjdns nodes.\n",
