   "body" : "When I minimize or \"close\" the Bitcoin client, I can no longer open the client without having to terminate it and re-launch it. If it was minimized, the window will come back up totally white with no controls on it, and if it was closed the window will not open when I click the system tray icon.\n\nI am using a custom shell in place of Windows Explorer called Xoblite, and it's based on BlackBox as far as I know. The previous client that I used, \"Bitcoin 0.3.21 BETA\", worked fine. The only other program I had a problem like this with was Skype before it updated recently.\n\nOther statistics that might be useful, maybe:\nWindows 7 x64 Professional\nATI graphics card\n\nIs there any way I can get more information to help diagnose the issue?\n",
