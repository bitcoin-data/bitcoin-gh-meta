Your first sentence appears a\nlittle weird, though (apart from the typo s/difficulty/difficult). How\nabout: \"To avoid attacks on Bitcoin a minimum fee of 0.0005 is required\nfor transactions under 0.01. Do you want to pay the fee?\"\n\nIf the reason is a large size, then printing the size might help to\ndecide if it's worth trying to make the transaction size smaller.\n\nBernhard\n\n## \n\nEncrypt emails.\nMy GPG key is on public key servers.\n",

      "body" : "The 'size' in question is the data size, not the transaction valueâ and their relationship is chaotic if not outright byzantine. :)\n\nThe reason I asked about the vague message is that it's actually quite hard to give the \"real\" reason in some cases.  E.g. say you have a 100 BTC input unconfirmed (so it won't use it),  and 100 btc in 1e-8 dust inputs.  You go to do a 10 btc transactions and the selection will ignore the 100 BTC unconfirmed input, then build a TXN which is too big to be permitted out of dust inputs. .. then come back and tell you that your transaction data was too big when the \"real\" issue was that the 100btc input wasn't confirmed yet.  There are a dozen variations of this.\n\nAnother similar case is,  consider that you have two possible transactions: one has 2 BTC in change, but will require a 0.0005 fee (because of its low priority or data size)...  Another would have 0.000001 BTC in change but require no fee except the change output of less than 0.01 means a fee of 0.0005 would be requiredâ so instead the system proposes you give up the 0.000001 change as fee thus avoid hitting the 0.01 rule.    If it says \"a minimum fee of 0.0005 is required for transactions under 0.01\" you'll be thinking \"what the heck, my output was >0.01, and that fee is much less than 0.0005!\"\n\nSo I think that we probably can't give specific understandable messages for all cases. We can probably give better messages for some, but we will need good generic text too.  So any suggestions on comprehensible generic text would be helpful. Crafting this kind of text is hard. \n",
