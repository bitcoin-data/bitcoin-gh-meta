Yes, transactions can be reconstructed from the blockchain, but this is slow, will not be possible in headers-only mode, does not reconstruct comments and other metadata about transactions, and does not work for transactions that are not confirmed yet.\n\nIn general, you really want to keep both keys and transactions in a wallet file, in a synchronized way. There is a keypool of 100 \"future\" keys (which is refilled when one is used), so you need only make a backup every 100 sent transactions or generated receive addresses.\n",
