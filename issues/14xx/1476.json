Blockchain.info for example lists the transaction just like every other one; I suggest that the client should do the same.\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=80187.msg969520#msg969520\nI sent some coins (using coincontrol) from one of my addresses (A) to another person (B) and decided to send the leftover amount (essentially the change) to one of my addresses (C).\nThe transaction to the other user just shows up fine in the transactions tab, however the one to myself is missing in the list.\nSince the involved balances are all correct (A to B is ok, change went to C, A is empty), I assume it's just not displayed in the transaction list.\n",
