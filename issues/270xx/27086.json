   "body" : "As compact block completion works currently, nodes reveal precisely the subset of transactions from published blocks that they already have in their mempool when they make a `GETBLOCKTXN` request for the transactions that they are missing during compact block relay. The greatest danger here is that nodes will never request their own transactions. Given a \"sufficient number\" of `GETBLOCKTXN`'s from a single peer, it will become possible to identify their wallet addresses with some degree of confidence. \r\n\r\nAssuming that all transactions except for a node's own, have a nonzero probability of not being in the node's mempool when a block is discovered, an attacker with an infinite set of `GETBLOCKTXN`'s from a single peer that reuses a finite number of pubkeys will have 100% confidence about what addresses belong to that peer.\r\n\r\nI am not a statistician, but I am actively trying to see if I can work out how large, and whether the \"sufficient number\" that gives a reasonable degree of confidence about a peer-pubkey correlation is a realistic scenario or not.\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents mempool fingerprinting by randomly adding  ~ 1 in 200 (0.5%) transactions from our mempool to our `GETBLOCKTXN`. Nodes that have less complete mempools (worse connections) will have fewer excess txn's to relay. (Nodes with 50% of block missing from mempool will tend to have about 5 excess transactions requested if there are 2000 txn's in a block) 0.5% is a number I mostly pulled out of thin air but  a maximum impact of 0.5% seems like a reasonable price to pay if the fingerprinting attack described is realistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
