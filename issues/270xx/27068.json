   "body" : "`SecureString` is a `std::string` specialization with a secure allocator. However, in practice it's treated like a C- string (no explicit length and null-terminated). This can cause unexpected and potentially insecure behavior. For instance, if a user enters a passphrase with embedded null characters (which is possible through Qt and the JSON-RPC), it will ignore any characters after the first null, potentially giving the user a false sense of security.\r\n\r\nInstead of assigning to `SecureString` via `std::string::c_str()`, assign it via a `std::string_view` of the original. This explicitly captures the size and still doesn't make any extraneous copies in memory.\r\n\r\nNote to reviewers, the following all compile identically in recent `GCC` (x86-64 and ARM64) with `-O2` (and `-std=c++17`):\r\n\r\n```C++\r\nstd::string orig_string;\r\nstd::cin >> orig_string;\r\nSecureString s;\r\ns.reserve(100);\r\n// The following all compile identically\r\ns = orig_string;\r\ns = std::string_view{orig_string};\r\ns.assign(std::string_view{orig_string});\r\ns.assign(orig_string.data(), orig_string.size());\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it's largely a matter of preference. However, one thing to keep in mind is that we want to avoid making unnecessary copies of any sensitive data in memory. \r\n\r\nSomething like `SecureString s{orig_string};` is still invalid and probably unwanted in our case, since it'd get treated as a short string and optimized away from the secure allocator. I presume that's the reason for the `reserve()` calls.\r\n\r\nFixes #27067.",
