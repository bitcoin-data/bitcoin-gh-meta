   "body" : "Fixes #20070\r\n\r\nCurrently `ArgsManager::GetDataDir()` ensures it will always return a datadir by creating one if necessary. The function is shared between `bitcoind` `bitcoin-qt` and `bitcoin-cli` which results in the undesirable behaviour described in #20070.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits out the part of the function which creates directories and adds it as a standalone function, only called as part of `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt` init, but not `bitcoin-cli`.\r\n\r\n`ReadConfigFiles`' behavior is changed to use the absolute path of the config file in error and warning messages instead of a relative path.\r\n\r\nThis was inadvertantly the form being tested [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/73966f75f67fb797163f0a766292a79d4b2c1b70/test/functional/feature_config_args.py#L287), whilst we were _not_ testing that a relative path was returned by the message even though we passed a relative path in as argument.",
