Itâs not clear to me what problem this would solve.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes feel a few things are easier or better as they have been working for years, however this was the first time I interacted with a guy who already understood how mempool works for other blockchains that I dont want to mention here. It was difficult to educate him about about fee bumping and how this could be avoided if some transaction get dropped in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe limit I shared was 300 MB for most nodes, maybe some nodes use less or more but it wont get propagated if default is less. \r\n\r\nThis motivated me to increase the mempool size as I feel 300 MB is way less than machines we have today. I never imagined I will have a phone with more RAM than my laptop in 2016.  It is possible today and we have better configs for mobile, desktop and server machines.",

      "body" : "I believe there was no mempool limit until late 2015, a 300 MB limit was added in  794a8cec5db84fde1cce82ada51740070ec188ac.\r\n\r\nWith the recent influx of relatively large blocks it still fit 70 blocks worth of transactions. Assuming 50% overhead in the way we store transactions in the mempool, I think the worst case is 40 blocks, or about 6 hours. This is significantly less than the default expiration of mempool transactions, which is two weeks. Before SegWit, our mempool would fit 1 day of worst case blocks.\r\n\r\nSo one could perhaps argue that it's annoying that you can't in practice send a transaction at a low fee rate, that is likely to confirm within one day. But even increasing the default mempool by 4x isn't going to be much help if you're trying to sit out a multi-day surge.\r\n\r\nSo I think it's more useful to continue working on having the wallet / node rebroadcast transactions in a privacy-preserving manner. For nodes that are always on that should be enough.\r\n\r\n> changing defaults in Bitcoin full node distributions like RaspiBolt, RaspiBlitz, Umbrel, etc\r\n\r\nThey could inspect the total memory* on the machine and then pick a larger mempool. To prevent fingerprinting though, I suggest limiting the options, e.g. either 300MB or 1GB. * = also useful for picking a good `-dbcache` value to speed up IBD.",
