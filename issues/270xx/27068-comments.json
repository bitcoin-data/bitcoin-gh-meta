I agree that it could be useful to provide feedback in these (likely unusual) cases.\r\n\r\nI can think of three potential approaches:\r\n\r\n1. The one you described -- though we may want to be explicit about the version they'd need to run.\r\n2. Return something like _\"Error: decryption failed: the passphrase contains a null character. If this passphrase was set with a version of this software prior to 25.0, please try again with only the characters up to the first null character.\"_\r\n3. Check to see if the wallet _would_ decrypt using the substring up to the first null and only then emit errors (or even just warnings) like in 1 or 2.\r\n\r\nThe third option is probably the most user-friendly, and I don't _think_ it's a significant security reduction (it's a free second attempt), but my intuition says it's the wrong approach.

It's not _that_ far-fetched for a user to have used a null character in their password (e.g. through random password generator) so this will quite likely actually affect some users?\r\n\r\nI highly doubt it. I would be surprised if any password manager produced a passphrase that included non-typeable characters. I'm pretty sure they will stick to ascii, or the unicode for whatever the users' locale is, none of which will include a null character. Password managers make passwords that the user can still type out manually if they have to.

Since it's a non-destructive change, I think it's acceptable to just return a detailed error message for now. If it turns out that it affects more people than expected, we can add a more user-friendly process.\r\n\r\nIf nobody has any objections, I'll work on a commit that adds a detailed error message suggesting that they try the password up to the null character and subsequently change it if it's successful.",

That contains a backslash followed by a 0, which some things may interpret as a null character, but not always, and not necessarily in a way that will affect us. For example. my terminal will interpret it as a null character if I don't put quotes around it. It will give to the program everything up to the null character, so we wouldn't even know that the passphrase is supposed to have a null character. Qt will not interpret that sequence as a null character, it will find it to be a backslash followed by a 0. In both of these cases, the passphrase that we receive would not contain a null character.",
