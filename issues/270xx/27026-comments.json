When the node processes a block, it maintains the things it needs to fully validate new blocks (the UTXO set), so it no longer needs the full original blocks. It will only keep several days' worth of original blocks in your storage, not to exceed 2 GB.\r\n\r\nThe entire process will take a while to reach the current chaintip -- the exact time depends on many factors including your network speed and specific hardware. It generally ranges from several hours to a couple days.\r\n\r\nI agree that the message is a bit ambiguous about exactly when the data gets deleted. To be clear, it does not _store_ all ~450 GB and only then delete all but 2 GB. It will delete them as it goes.",
