   "body" : "This PR adds `last_block_announcement` to the per-peer `getpeerinfo` RPC result. This is the most recent time that this peer was the first to notify our node of a new block (one that we didn't already know about), or zero if this peer has never been the first to notify us of a new block. This timestamp already exists internally and is used for stale-tip eviction logic; this PR exposes it at the RPC layer.\r\n\r\nThis PR started out as a suggestion for additional test coverage, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26172#issuecomment-1259678260. It turned out that the easiest way to test (already-merged) #26172 is to add this field to `getpeerinfo` and have a functional test verify its value. But it may also be useful to have this result in its own right, similar to that RPC's existing `last_block` field -- it indicates something about the quality of our peers. It allows one to predict which peer will be evicted when the stale tip logic activates. (I'm not sure if that would be useful, but it may be.)\r\n\r\nExposing this timestamp to the RPC layer required moving it from `CNodeState` to `CNode`, which we want to do anyway, since `CNodeState` is intended for validation, and this timestamp isn't part of validation; it's similar to `last_block` (also used for eviction), which is already in `CNode`.\r\n\r\nThe functional test added here fails without #26172, which is the main goal.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not test the actual stale-tip eviction logic; that's difficult to do with a functional test. But it does test the correctness of the timestamp that the eviction logic depends on. #23352 is an attempt to test the eviction logic using a unit test, it's not ready to be merged yet. I think having both kinds of tests would be beneficial.",
