Improving privacy could involve implementing privacy-enhancing technologies like Coinjoin or zero-knowledge proofs.\r\n\r\nInteroperability: Making it easier for different bitcoin-based systems to interact with each other could help to foster innovation and adoption.\r\n\r\nSecurity: The code should be continuously audited and improved to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nUsability: Improving the user experience could involve making the software easier to use, speeding up confirmation times, or simplifying the process of setting up a full node.\r\n",
