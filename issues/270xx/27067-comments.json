This means that if the passphrase is used to secure the wallet and includes a null character, the software may be processing only a portion of the intended passphrase, potentially leading to the wallet being unlocked using an incorrect or malicious passphrase. \r\nI agree using a SecureString can help mitigate the issue of passphrases silently ignoring everything after a null character by ensuring that the sensitive information is protected in memory and is not simply stored as a plain text string that could be vulnerable to exploitation. Still learning, Cheers. ",
