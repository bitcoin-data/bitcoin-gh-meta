   "body" : "These overloaded operators were introduced almost seven years ago in the implementation of OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (BIP112, PR #7524, commit 53e53a33c939949665f60d5eeb82abbb21f97128), but have never been used since outside of fuzzing. One could argue to keep those around solely for consistency reasons, but I think its preferable to get rid of methods that are likely never used. Even the so-far only use of the & operator (checking the OP_CSV argument for the SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_DISABLE_FLAG), could be removed by simply doing the check on the returned `GetInt64()`, but fiddling in the consensus code is probably not worth it.",
