   "body" : "Don't enable `-Werror` (in the CI) for compilers at least older than our current release compiler (GCC 10). It provides little-to-no value, other than turning compiler bugs & false positives into build failures, and we aren't going to mutate perfectly fine/working code, for the sake of avoid a warning that shouldn't even exist.\r\n\r\nI also do not see the point of playing whack-a-mole and turning off various warnings/trying to further work around the broken compiler, just to acheive warningless builds for the sake of warningless builds.\r\n\r\nOne anecdote from [\"How SQLite Is Tested\"](https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html):\r\n> Static analysis has found a few bugs in SQLite, but those are the\r\n> exceptions. More bugs have been introduced into SQLite while trying\r\n> to get it to compile without warnings than have been found by static\r\n> analysis.",
