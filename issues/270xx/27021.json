Intended to be\r\nused by wallet to calculate amounts needed for fee-bumping unconfirmed\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\nFrom comments of sipa and glozow below:\r\n\r\n> > In what way does the code added here differ from the real block assembly code?\r\n> \r\n>    * Only operates on the relevant transactions rather than full mempool\r\n>    * Has the ability to remove transactions that will be replaced so they don't impact their ancestors\r\n>    * Does not hold mempool lock outside of the constructor, makes copies of the entries it needs instead (though I'm not sure if this has an effect in practice)\r\n>    * Doesn't do the sanity checks like keeping weight within max block weight and `IsFinalTx()`\r\n>    * After the block template is built, additionally calculates fees to bump remaining ancestor packages to target feerate\r\n\r\n",
