   "body" : "`LookupSubNet()` would treat addresses that start with `fc` as IPv6 even if `-cjdnsreachable` is set. This creates the following problems where it is called:\r\n\r\n* `NetWhitelistPermissions::TryParse()`: otherwise `-whitelist=` fails to white list CJDNS addresses: when a CJDNS peer connects to us, it will be matched against IPv6 `fc...` subnet and the match will never succeed.\r\n\r\n* `BanMapFromJson()`: CJDNS bans are stored as just IPv6 addresses in `banlist.json`. Upon reading from disk they have to be converted back to CJDNS, otherwise, after restart, a ban entry like (`fc00::1`, IPv6) would not match a peer (`fc00::1`, CJDNS).\r\n    \r\n* `RPCConsole::unbanSelectedNode()`: in the GUI the ban entries go through `CSubNet::ToString()` and back via `LookupSubNet()`. Then it must match whatever is stored in `BanMan`, otherwise it is impossible to unban via the GUI.\r\n\r\nThese were uncovered by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26859.\r\n\r\nThus, flip the result of `LookupSubNet()` to CJDNS if the network base address starts with `fc` and `-cjdnsreachable` is set. Since subnetting/masking does not make sense for CJDNS (the address is \"random\" bytes, like Tor and I2P, there is no hierarchy) treat `fc.../mask` as an invalid `CSubNet`.\r\n\r\nTo achieve that, `MaybeFlipIPv6toCJDNS()` has to be moved from `net` to `netbase` and thus also `IsReachable()`. In the process of moving `IsReachable()`, `SetReachable()` and `vfLimited[]` encapsulate those in a class.",
