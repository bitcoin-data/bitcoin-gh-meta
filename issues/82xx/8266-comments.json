It would ignore only that particular use of the bit, if the same bit is recycled and used again, it should still warn.\n\nSo it's more like a \"not after\" rather than a not before. Right now the bip9 logic warns forever once an unknown bit is activated. So this proposes the ability to ignore a specific activation event (which is a height/bit or blockhash/bit pair), but continue to warn on future activation events using that bit.\n\nThis lets you look at it and go \"oh, this is OP_CHECKSPATULAVERIFY, I don't care about that, won't impact my usage... ignore\"   but later when MULCHBABIES softfork happens on the same bit, you'll get warned again and be able to respond with a pitchfork.\n",
