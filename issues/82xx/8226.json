This commit adjusts them to make them conform to formatting best practices, to stay under 80 characters when possible.\n2. Adhere to consist use of quotes. There are a few instances where smart quotes are used (perhaps because it was pasted from a word processor). This commit replaces them with dumb quotes to keep it consistent with the quotation formatting found in the rest of the document.\n",
