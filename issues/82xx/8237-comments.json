My workaround for now is to use `brew switch qt5 5.5.1_2` to go back to 5.5, which seems to compile without issues. I don't know offhand if this is because I did a `brew tap homebrew/versions` earlier, which led to homebrew/versions/qt55 showing up when running `brew search qt5`.\n",

The issue is this:\n\nIf the osx compiler in the future defaults to a higher std version (c++14/c++17), everything else will be compiled that way, while the .mm's are hard-coded to c++11. g++ 6.1+ already does that, so if someone has installed a recent g++ from brew, this will cause issues.\n\nIdeally, ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx.m4 would export OBJCXX as well. We might be better off patching/upstreaming that change.\n",
