Obviously the biggest hurdle is the DDOS vector from invalid signatures but do you think there is a way around that through some sort of rate-limiting approach or something more clever possibly to detect and manage stray/invalid signature verification requests?\r\n\r\nWith the multi-core CPUs and highly optimized secp256k1 it may allow us to scale throughput drastically if it were possible, just a thought!",
