   "body" : "In help from `bitcoind -h` it specifes that `conf` can only be used from the commandline. However, if `conf` is set in a `bitcoin.conf` file, there is no error and from reading the logs it seems as if the `conf=<other file>` is being used, despite it being ignored. To recreate, you can setup a `bitcoin.conf` file in the default directory, add `conf=<some other file>.conf` and in the separate config file set whichever config value you want and verify that it is being ignored. alternatively, if you set `includeconf=<some other file>.conf` , your config in `<some other file>` will be picked up.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by having the node error when reading the config file if `conf=` is set.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it was mentioned in a recent [PR review club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/24858) that if `reindex=1` is set in the config file, the node will reindex on every startup, which is undesirable:\r\n ```irc\r\n17:14 <larryruane> michaelfolkson: Reindex is requested by the user (node operator) as a configuration option (command line or in the config file, tho you probably would never put it in the file, or else it would reindex on every startup!)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR also has a commit to warn if `reindex=1` is set in the config file.\r\n",
