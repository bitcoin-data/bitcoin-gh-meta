      "body" : "Thank you for your comment. While preparing a response, I realized that the order in which results are collected and compared already results in something even better than what I was trying to achieve.\r\n\r\nThe tiebreaker would only affect situations in which multiple SelectionResults were tied for best waste score and had the same input count. This should only occur when we have two solutions with change that spend the same output types, which probably is most likely on single-input solutions and might occur a bit more often after #24584.\r\n\r\nMy motivation was that if SRD e.g. proposed a change of â¿15 and Knapsack found a solution with â¿0.2, it would be preferable to not reveal the large amount to the recipient and to assign less rather than more funds to an unconfirmed output. My proposed change could have caused that the [unnecessary input heuristic](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy#Unnecessary_input_heuristic) were accurate slightly more often if a tie occurred with multiple inputs when additionally the SRD change amount ended up being smaller than the min_change randomly picked for Knapsack (see #24494).\r\n\r\nIt turns out that due to the order in which SelectionResults are collected and compared, we always prefer the Knapsack solution on ties, which mitigates my concern regarding an unnecessary large change. I don't think your concern applies for the current behavior though, because we generate `min_change` that is up to 2Ã the recipient amount since #24494 with a maximum of 1,000,000 sats (which was the fixed min_change before). So at least it's not worse than the behavior we had for the prior decade.",
