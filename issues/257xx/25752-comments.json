I think that would be very helpful anyway, in order to collect targeted feedback from the actual users that these changes will affect.\r\n\r\nI use the REST interface in two of my projects:\r\n- My mempool-observer queries `/rest/mempool/contents.json` as I've found it to be faster than the`getrawmempool` RPC, especially significant when my mempool is full. Also, using the REST interface instead of the RPC interface, I don't have to bake in any user/pass configuration. Also, no dependency on JSON RPC library. Using e.g. a Python/other RPC->REST proxy as discussed in #23259 would work, but also means an additional service that can break. \r\n- A WIP project of mine similar to https://forkmonitor.info uses the `getchaintips` RPC (I think this information could also be exposed via REST) and queries headers both via `getblockheader` and the old `/rest/headers/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.bin` REST interface. I need to query many headers, so I prefer getting 2000 headers via REST than headers one-by-one via the `getblockheader` RPC (maybe getting a range of headers should be added to the RPC interface). I currently use the old, deprecated REST interface as I want to support older Bitcoin Core versions (similar to forkmonitor.info I want to query e.g. Bitcoin Core version v0.10 and v23 to compare their chain tips). Going forward, I think I will have to keep functionality for the deprecated interface and add the new interface.\r\n\r\nHappy to provide more usage feedback - feel free to ask.\r\n\r\nI think, if we keep the REST interface it's worth modernizing it. The proposed changes in your first three PRs seem reasonable.  Having a `-deprecatedrest` option for a while (one or two major releases) makes sense, but the old endpoints should be dropped eventually. \r\n",

I think extending the RPC to support fetching multiple blockheaders would make sense if that otherwise prevents the REST API from being updated.\r\n\r\n> why not just /rest/1/ or something to denote request versions?\r\n\r\nI initially implemented it that way and it would be my preferred approach, but since it (admittedly not by a crazy amount) increased the amount of code to review for (what I assumed to be) no substantial benefit in this particular case so I scrapped it. If indeed we want one bitcoind to be able to serve both v0 and v1 endpoints then that would be the way to go. But, practically, I'm not sure there's real demand for that? E.g. in your example if just one of both (external) services supports both versions, then your REST server can just run that shared version. This seems to be the case in this example since @0xB10C plans to add support for both interfaces. It would generally be a better design though, so I'll look into it again - thanks for the feedback.",
