   "body" : "This PR adds a signature to the encrypted key records (`ckey` and `walletdescriptorckey`) which acts as an additional checksum. The signature is produced by the private key, and signs the encrypted private key data. It is a schnorr signature. The signature is verified when the encrypted key record is loaded, and if it fails to verify then the loading fails with a wallet corrupted error.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of doing this is to mitigate a common scam where users are given/sold a wallet file that contains \"encrypted\" private keys that correspond to several high valued UTXOs. However the \"encrypted\" keys are not actually encrypted, they are just garbage data. The signature allows the wallet to ensure that the private keys for the stated pubkeys was known at the time of encryption, so it should help mitigate this scam by making it harder for scammers to make high value UTXOs appear to be IsMine.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, a downgrade attack where the scammer can continue to do this with a wallet that does not have signatures over the encrypted keys. To mitigate this, the user will get a warning when they open a wallet that has encrypted keys without signatures. When the wallet is next unlocked, the signatures will be generated and written to the wallet file.",
