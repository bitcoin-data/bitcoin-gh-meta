   "body" : "**Draft, for reference only to support #25752 for discussion on concept and approach. Code and tests should be fully functional, but still to be considered rough.** Commits specific to this PR start from [rest: store endpoint prefix data in HTTPRequest](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25754/commits/dd99555d1e82b05674581584c3d8278472710a45).\r\n\r\n## Brief summary\r\n#24098 introduced a simple `HTTPRequest::GetQueryParameter()` function to access query parameters directly from the request, which is passed to every endpoint function. This PR extends this interface by introducing a similarly behaving `HTTPRequest::GetPath()` and `HTTPRequest::GetPathParameter()`. \r\n\r\nPreviously, path data was accessed through the `strURIpart` parameter which was passed to all endpoints. Since this data was already contained in the `HTTPRequest req` and we now have `HTTPRequest::GetPath()` and `HTTPRequest::GetPathParameter()` which are more intuitive to use, the `strURIpart` parameter is removed from the endpoint callback, simplifying the interface.\r\n\r\nFinally, the `?count` query parameter introduced by #24098 is now made required, unless `-deprecatedrest=count` is enabled. This way users understand the endpoint is updating, and we can reasonably remove it in some future update to simplify the code.",
