My concern would be that without a (relatively) static formal document outlining what rules are being followed and why the rationale for policy changes won't be clear. Regular unscrutinized changes and tweaks will become the norm and make them much harder to monitor and analyze.\r\n\r\n> There is also the fact that raising our policy documentation as a BIP \"best\" standard could give an inaccurate perception across the ecosystem that Core policy is \"authoritative\" and discourage experimentation or divergent policy deployment by other Bitcoin softwares.\r\n\r\nOther than on consensus no BIP is attempting to be authoritative. As the dominant implementation on the network Core is setting the default policy rules for the vast majority of nodes and attempting to maintain compatibility with a BIP means more scrutiny and an alternative point of reference to compare to. (The recent exercise of comparing current Core code to BIP125 for example was much more rigorous than it would have been if comparing Core code to an internal Core doc that may or may not be up to date.)\r\n\r\nedit: Maybe it is acceptable (or even desirable) for the RBF rules to be in a constant state of flux. There have been multiple ideas/proposals on changing the RBF rules in recent months. In that case a new BIP clearly does not make sense. But if the aspiration is to have a set of RBF rules with strong rationales that don't regularly change, moving from having a BIP to internal Core documentation seems like an erosion of scrutiny to me.",

It wasn't clear to me from the first post's description that this already existedâyou could perhaps highlight that more in the first post. Given that most of the nodes on the network are Bitcoin Core, I'm not sure whether a BIP is strictly needed in that case then, but a BIP might still be a bit easier to discover. Since it's bad to have two diverging authoritative sources, I would agree that a BIP should wait until the rules aren't expected to change much anymore.",
