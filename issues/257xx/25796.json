   "body" : "This PR implements an RPC called `descriptorprocesspsbt`. This RPC is based off of `walletprocesspsbt`, but instead of interacting with the wallet to update, sign and finalize a psbt, it instead accepts an array of output descriptors and uses that information along with information from the mempool and the utxo set to do so. `utxoupdatepsbt` also updates a psbt in this manner, but doesn't sign or finalize it. Because of this overlap, a helper function that is added in this PR is called by both `utxoupdatepsbt` and `descriptorprocesspsbt`. Whether or not the helper function signs a psbt is dictated by if the HidingSigningProvider passed to it contains any private information. There is also a test added in this PR for this new RPC that uses p2wsh, p2wpkh, and legacy outputs. It should be noted that this RPC can't update a psbt spending any non-segwit outputs with information from the mempool or utxo set for reasons described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13932#issue-349305114).",
