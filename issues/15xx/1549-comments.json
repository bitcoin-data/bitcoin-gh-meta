In terms of making the user make two/three calls to get at the info on whether or not a given added node is connected, I entirely disagree here.  I'll add a in/out/not connected flag.\n\n@sipa The goal is to allow a long-running node to add trusted nodes without having to restart.  In terms of having a one-shot connection, this was discussed back when addnode was changed, since it used to be a one-off, I was then of the opinion that addnode shouldn't be scrapped to allow for that and keepnode was clearer in this case...  In any case, I agree that there should be an option for a one-off connection creator RPC, Ill throw that in when I touch this up (connecttonode?).\n",
