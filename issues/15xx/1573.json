I was not able to find a reliable source that sheds some light on my question.\n\nSee:\nhttp://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qmake-advanced-usage.html\n\nThere is always `win32` mentioned. Same for `mac`, which should perhaps be `macx`.\n\nAnyway, I tried replacing all occurrences of `windows` with `win32` and it compiles fine on my local setup. Perhaps a main dev can take a look at this.\n",
