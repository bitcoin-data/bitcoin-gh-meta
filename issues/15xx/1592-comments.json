Rename Window title to `Bitcoin-Qt - Wallet`\n   -> Bitcoin-Qt is the GUI to Bitcoin and this keeps Wallet but separated by \"-\" to ensure users don't think the client is called \"Bitcoin Wallet\".\n2. Rename `About Bitcoin-Qt` -> `About Bitcoin`\n   -> We show version stuff that is not the Qt client version, but the Bitcoin \"core\" version.\n3. Rename `Client` in the Debug window -> `Core`, `Bitcoin Core` or `Core Client`\n   -> This is clearer in terms of we use the Core and have the Qt GUI on top.\n\nOh and for not knowing Qt, we have an `About Qt` in the GUI :).\n\nWhat do you think?\n",
