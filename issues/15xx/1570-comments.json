I don't see any way of solving that directly.\n\nWhat I think would help would be options to \"take any fee out of the amount being sent\" which would remove that problem since the coin selection wouldn't change, and would do exactly what you wanted for the 'send all my coins case'.  Also,  an option to \"round sent amount up, up to X btc\", useful when sending to another account of yours, would also tend to reduce fees fairly considerably...  but I don't know how UI for that stuff could be done in a non-confusing way.\n",
