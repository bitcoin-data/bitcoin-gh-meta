Gitian is being used simply because it is the most reliable process for doing cross-platform builds of bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt.\n\nIncluded are are a handful of fixes required to get gitian running within an already-virtualized environment, and in time (aka, when I or someone else has time) those patches will be generalized and submitted upstream to gitian-builder. But that should be a minor footnote. This is really about doing cross-platform or local builds without complicated dedicated build servers.\n",
