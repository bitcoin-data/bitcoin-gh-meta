Its only checked into git so that people who git clone && cd src && make can continue to do that.  (and one can't simply build with an empty one as they will end up rejecting the 2 BIP30-invalid blocks which are in the chain before BIP30 was enforced).

That will screw up the auto-version-determination code...\n\nAlso, with a generated checkpoints_def.cpp, I get a gazillion:\ncheckpoints_def.cpp:185334: warning: this decimal constant is unsigned only in ISO C90\n\nI think adding the 4 checkpoints and doing BIP30-check-all-except-checkpointed-blocks is the right thing to do.\n",
