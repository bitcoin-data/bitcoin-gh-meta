That certainly needs a lot of testing, as it can easily have subtle bugs. Maybe it is easier to clean up the code so that we don't need recursive locking at all (if all data structures are properly encapsulated, you can put the taking of locks in all entry functions, and never further inside).\n\nAlso, to get the best performance, you'll also need support for upgradable locks. For example, connecting a block has two stages, one where data is read from the backend (inputs fetched from db), and one where the changes are committed. If the first stage happens in an upgradable lock, it can happen concurrently with read-only locks (most RPC queries...), even while protecting that only a single (potential) writer is active.\n",

      "body" : "My point was less of doing something in one session and more of doing it it multiple \"sessions\" that are really recursive calls that are very non-obvious.  This is especially a problem with cs_main, which covers multiple, largely unrelated data structures.  Yes, if Bitcoin were designed properly and if the switch to using shared/upgrade/unique locks were instant, it likely wouldn't be an issue.  However, take, ProcessMessage, it currently takes a cs_main exclusive lock, however it is conceivable that many of its branches only need a SHARED or UPGRADE lock.  Take, specifically, tx processing.  It is conceivable that tx processing will only need a mempool exclusive lock, and only a shared lock on cs_main.  However, once the tx is accepted and the wallet is called to process, the wallet may end up taking a cs_main lock as a part of one of its routines (even though it may only need a shared lock, but the old code only knows exclusive).  Debugging such issues and tracking down each case where this may occur can get very complicated in the current bitcoin codebase.  The idea behind providing shared->exclusive upgrade is to take away one more thing that would otherwise have to be audited for when converting to shared locking.  Yes, such things /should/ be caught, but there is no guarantee and it takes away just one more failure mode.\n",
