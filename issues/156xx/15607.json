The former is done in practice (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15555, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14902) and the latter addresses the discussion here yesterday: https://x0f.org/web/statuses/101753569204220416.\r\n\r\n- Reorganise the headers in the Branch Updates section.\r\n\r\n- Update the version numbers in the examples.\r\n\r\n- Adapt and merge in the updates in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15692.\r\n",
