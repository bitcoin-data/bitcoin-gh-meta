The new implementation of `IPv6ToString` (which is called from `CNetAddr::ToString`) follows Rust's `std::net::Ipv6Addr` which does not append `%zone_index`. FWIW that is how the previous implementation of `CNetAddr::ToString` worked under macOS.\r\n* If you by \"functionality\" mean anything else, then no.\r\n\r\nFWIW this is what I said back in April 14 (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21682#issuecomment-819897122) about this:\r\n\r\n> 1.) I don't understand why we test if `ToString()` output includes `%zone_index`: it clearly doesn't on some platforms, so we cannot rely on it anyways. Then why test it?\r\n> \r\n> 2.) And perhaps more fundamentally: why would we even _want_ to have `%zone_index` in our textual `ToString()` output? I think the expectation is to get say `fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a` (without zone index) and not say `fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a%eth2 ` or `fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a%3 `when doing `ipv6_addr.ToString()` :)\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that you think something should be changed: feel free to open a PR making the changes you wish to see.",
