   "body" : "Hi,\r\n\r\nIs there a way to blacklist some addresses from being used on the blockchain? Or even blocking UTXO from being spent?\r\n\r\nI am currently experimenting on various fork of bitcoins, and looking for such feature which is not included on any of them.\r\n\r\n@luke-jr already talked about this on:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6175#issuecomment-104748247\r\n\r\nThe goal let's say as a new bitcoin fork, I want to prevent satoshi nakamoto's addresses from being spent. (He deserve to spend them but it's just an experiment). And must be hard coded and not on the software side.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance",
