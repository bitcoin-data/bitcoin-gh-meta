   "body" : "Currently `WALLET_FLAG_EXTERNAL_SIGNER` is just a precaution. This PR makes the flag mutable so it can be toggled with `setwalletflag`. There's a warning that in the future it may no longer be possible to toggle. This might be the case if we need to store additional device specific data in the wallet payload.\r\n\r\nAdditionally this PR exposes this flag in `getwalletinfo`. This field is omitted when external wallet support is not compiled in.\r\n\r\nRationale for this PR is to make it a bit easier to switch between tooling, e.g. to \"upgrade\" a regular watch-only wallet created by Specter to work with Core hardware wallet support directly.",
