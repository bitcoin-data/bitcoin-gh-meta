I'd prefer not to cache this in the mempool to avoid wasting memory, and I'm not sure it's worth reserializing the mempool contents to calculate this value whenever a user calls getrawmempool, because that rpc is already slow enough, and I don't know what the use case here would be...  Note that users can always calculate the serialized size themselves by asking for the serialized transaction directly, eg with getrawtransaction.",
