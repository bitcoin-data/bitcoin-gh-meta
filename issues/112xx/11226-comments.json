Do you happen to know which core developers that would be appropriate reviewers for this work (on a deeper `GUARDED_BY(â¦)` level for each module)?\r\n\r\nThe types of errors I might need some help from reviewers to avoid:\r\n* False positives: Too restrictive lock requirements. Requiring a lock where a lock is not needed. More concretely: unnecessary `GUARDED_BY(â¦)` annotations. (The `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(â¦)` annotations follow more or less mechanically for the `GUARDED_BY(â¦)`.)\r\n* False negatives: Missing lock requirements. Not requiring a lock where a lock is needed. More concretely: missing `GUARDED_BY(â¦)` annotations.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps most importantly: help reviewing that the *added* locks in this PR looks reasonable. In constrast to the annotations they alter run-time behaviour.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of `AssertLockHeld(â¦)`:s that I've been unable to map to variables being guarded. I might need some help to track those down to add the corresponding `GUARDED_BY(â¦)`:s (and hence `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(â¦)`). I'm a bit hesitant to just add `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(â¦)` to match the `AssertLockHeld(â¦)` (which would be trivial) since that methodology hides the fact that the guard required hasn't been explicitly stated using an `GUARDED_BY(â¦)` annotation yet.",

It may very well be the case that you'd miss a NotifyWatchonlyChanged fire if you have an AddWatchOnly and a RemoveWatchOnly call at the same time (though I don't know if there are any negative effects from doing so).\r\n* RescanFromTime indeed does not appear to require cs_wallet (obviously ScanForWalletTransactions does, but it takes it itself). It obviously needs cs_main, though.",
