This PR implements `verifyrawtransaction`, which accepts a hex encoded raw transaction and determines if it could be included in the next block. It does this by creating a \"fake\" block with the proposed transaction, and then checking that the block is valid with `TestBlockValidity`.\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at contributing to bitcoin, so if I've already managed to break any unspoken (or spoken) rules, please let me know ð ",
