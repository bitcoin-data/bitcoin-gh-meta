The output would need to prove the entire coinbase tx and then include a wtxid proof to the witness commitment. `merkleblock` is well-documented but this extra proof might need a BIP spec even if its just for an RPC. \r\n\r\nAre there any other uses for merkleblock proofs outside of SPV wallets? There hasn't been any more discussion on this issue for 6 years and we have client-side filtering available now which doesn't require proofs at all... so I wonder if this is important enough to work on or if we can close as wont-fix ?",
