(it is a work in progress - I understand ) BUT : Gitian seems like a great way to go for various reasons but it also impedes our ability to replicate the builds easily. All I am trying to do is build a windows version of the bitcoind.exe for 64-bit. I can build it for Ubuntu Precise just fine . but when attempting to cross compile I get all sort of issues.  \n\nWhat I am really trying to say .. is that the pulltester is broken and creating EXE's via the gitian method is also no walk in the park.  I also tried MING ( as per the outdated docs ) . also failed. Fundamentally - 2 weeks in and I still can't build a windows EXE for 0.9. \n",

I dont' want to go through all the different permutation I have been through in order to achieve a gitian build. Suffice it to say the Host machine is also extremely relevant in the process. i.e. the Gitian build can't be build in a VM since it is a VM Host itself. i.e. in order to build a few megabyte windows .exe one needs 3 Precise's  setup as hosts and guests. i.e. a dedicated box that will run Virtualbox perfectly. I am picking apart the bulld but cant seem to find the best --host to pass to ./configure for a cross compile to windows.\n",
