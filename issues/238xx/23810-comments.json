Only ~700 lines, which is not a huge PR as far as this repo is concerned. I could also break this out into multiple PRs, ex. (one for src/test/; one for src/crypto; one for src/wallet; etc) such that it is easier to review, and less breaking.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI have broken up the commit into a number of commits, one for reinterpret, one for const/const+reint, one for bracket init, and then a few for remaining static casts in various parts of the codebase. I think at least merging the reinterpret and const/const+reint commit is valuable.\r\n",

This is as was suggested by jonatack https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24185#issuecomment-1026077083, and seems to be what MarcoFalke wants moving forward (as many of his PRs have changed c-style casts into functional casts).\r\n\r\nI don't see what the problem is with me reviewing PRs, and adding relevant suggestions that the author can either apply or not. I've given suggestions unrelated to \"don't use c-style casts\", as I've been looking for those c-style casts, I've been reviewing the PR in general. I understand that it may seem \"spammy\", but there are a lot of PRs that affect code containing c-style casts, and if possible, and if the PR author agrees, I'd like for those PRs to also change those c-style casts to better casts. \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that there is a degree of agreement that moving away from c-style casts is valuable. As such, there are two options.\r\n\r\nIf we want to do this change over multiple years and iteratively, that's fine, I'll ask PR authors as I review their PR to change c-style casts. If we want to do this in larger blocks, then I can create PRs that are as non-breaking as possible so that we can merge them, but it seems that there is consensus that we don't want to do this in larger blocks.",
