Use a new setting in settings.json file, notifypolicy which is 0 by default (restricted) and can be set to 1 (unrestricted)\r\n\r\nI am not sure if people will agree to make these changes so workaround is to just document the security recommendation. I understand *notify options are helpful for users, projects ,devs etc. however it can be misused in some cases and help attackers as well.",
