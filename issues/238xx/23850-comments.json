Bob cannot identify if something is malicious and runs few commands someone suggested to use with *notify config param to fix one of the issues. Bob thinks he is _doing the right thing_ but he is running a command which could end up in losing all his money.\r\n\r\n**How to avoid this?** _Don't examine each script._ Create some restrictions that blocks any suspicious commands, scripts, connections etc. Unfortunately we don't have any such feature in Bitcoin Core so users have to do it at system level.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n1. PowerShell has execution polices which can be used to restrict scripts: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.2\r\n\r\n2. Macros can be used to run malicious scripts in Word documents. However we have settings to disable it (restriction).
