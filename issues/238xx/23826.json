   "body" : "This PR (joint work with Amiti Uttarwar) changes the addrman unit tests such that they only use the public `AddrMan` interface:\r\nThis has the advantage that the tests are less implementation-dependent, i.e. it would be possible to rewrite the internal addrman implementation (as drafted [here](https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/tree/202106_multiindex_addrman) for using a multiindex) without having to adjust the tests.\r\n\r\nThis includes the following steps:\r\n* Adding a test-only function `FindAddressEntry()` to the public addrman interface which returns info about an address in addrman (e.g. bucket, position, whethe the address is in new or tried).  Obviously we want to do this sparingly, but I think a single test-only function is ok (which could also be useful elsewhere, e.g. in fuzz tests).\r\n* Removal of the `AddrManTest` subclass which would reach into AddrMan's internals, using `AddrMan` instead\r\n* Removal of tests for internal helper functions that are not publicly exposed (these are still tested indirectly via the public functions calling them).\r\n* Additional tests for previously untested features such as multiplicity in the new tables, that can be tested with the help of `FindAddressEntry()`.\r\n \r\nAll in all, this PR increases the unit test coverage of AddrMan by a bit.",
