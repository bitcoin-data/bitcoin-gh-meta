   "body" : "This PR enables one more of the non-wallet functional tests (rpc_scantxoutset.py) to be run even with the Bitcoin Core wallet disabled by using the MiniWallet instead, as proposed in #20078 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23858#issue-1088320649 more recently.\r\n\r\nReviewer's guide:\r\n* [commit 1/3] For replacing the getnewaddress/getaddressinfo RPC calls a helper `getnewdestination` is introduced which allows to create addresses with the common address format types ('legacy', 'p2sh-segwit' and 'bech32'), but also additionally returns the corresponding pubkey and output script.\r\n* [commit 2/3] In order to send to addresses with MiniWallet, a helper `address_to_scriptpubkey` is introduced. It only supports legacy addresses (Base58Check) so far, which is sufficient for the scantxoutset test.\r\n* [commit 3/3] With those helpers, the use of MiniWallet in the test is quite straight-forward. To avoid repeatedly specifying parameters like `from_node` to MiniWallet's `send_to` method, another test-internal helper `sendtodestination` is introduced which supports specifying the destination both as outputscript or as address.",
