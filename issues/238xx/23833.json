(exmaple merge: 887796a5ffcbafcd281b920f8d55fcb6e8347584)\r\n\r\nI think it could make sense to also include:\r\n\r\n* a list of stale ACKs and potentially non-code-review ACKs or NACKs. Obviously this has the issue that any of them might be stale, but it might make it easier to get a general idea of the support/opposition on a pull request.\r\n* signatures for ACKs. The benefit will be that signatures are less likely to be \"made up\" (for example by GitHub or by someone who compromised a GitHub account). The problem is that practically no one signs ACKs and that signature formats are too verbose to include verbatim in the merge commit message. If there was a better way to include signatures, we could move toward a scheme where several reviewers contribute toward the merge commit similar to how the guix attestations are produced. ",
