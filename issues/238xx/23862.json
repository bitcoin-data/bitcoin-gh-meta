   "body" : "Our Guix build system sets the [`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`](https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/) and propagates it to the depends build subsystem. Its [default value](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/guix/README.md#recognized-environment-variables) is the top commit timestamp.\r\n\r\nAfter bumping Qt version up to 5.15.2, due to [this](https://github.com/qt/qtbase/commit/1ffcca4cc208c48ddb06b6a23abf1756f9724351) change, every time they are going to make new Guix builds for another branch/commit they must ensure that the `qt` package will be rebuilt from scratch. Otherwise, Bitcoin Core GUI binaries will be non-deterministic.\r\n\r\nSuch behavior makes working with Guix builds suboptimal.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the described issue by patching Qt RCC and hardcoding last modified timestamps with `1`.\r\n\r\nIt's worth to mention that this change is compatible with a possible future [improvement](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21995) which makes each dependency package reproducible.\r\n\r\nA drawback of such an approach is not currently applied to our project, as it effectively makes [QML cache files](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-57182) useless. I can't say it's a problem for the https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui-qml project.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**A note for thinkers:** For now this change is enough as only Qt source contains `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`. But in general we should re-think about treating the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` variable in the depends build subsystem. For instance, its default value could be the output of `git log --format=%at -1 -- depends`.\r\n\r\n",
