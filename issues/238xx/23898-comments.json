Ubuntu and Debian have their own `libdb-dev` and `libdb++-dev` packages, but these will install Berkeley DB 5.1 or later. This will break binary wallet compatibility with the distributed executables, which are based on BerkeleyDB 4.8. If you do not care about wallet compatibility, pass `--with-incompatible-bdb` to configure. Otherwise, you can build Berkeley DB yourself.\r\n\r\nAlso https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md#berkeley-db",

      "body" : "> I followed a flow inspired from this gist\r\n\r\nI'd suggest following a flow inspired by our [actual build documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/doc), rather than random internet gists. There are a couple different issues here.\r\n\r\nFor starters, the gist states:\r\n> this script is intended for a node to support the network and not to act as a wallet,\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure why it's going to the trouble of compiling and building against BDB at all. Rather than just compiling with `--disable-wallet`.\r\n\r\nSecond, the gist is a guide for compiling Bitcoin Core version `v0.21.1`. Given that you're compiling `v0.22`, you don't need to install `libssl-dev` or `libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler`, as they are no longer dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe gist adds `-O2` to it's `CPPFLAGS`, I'm not sure why, optimization flags should really exist in `CXXFLAGS`. Although note that `-O2` is also the autoconf default, so you shouldn't need to pass this at all.\r\n\r\nNote that passing both `--with-zmq` and  `--enable-zmq` is redundant. If you've got the zmq libs installed, you could actually pass neither, and zmq support will be auto detected (you can check via the configure summary).\r\n\r\nIn regards to your linking issue. It looks like newer versions of BDB will, by default, try and build \"SSL support for Replication Manager\", see [`--with-repmgr-ssl`](https://docs.oracle.com/database/bdb181/html/installation/build_unix_conf.html), which would pull in libssl as a dependency, and if you're not linking against it, your build will fail. I'd suggest either compiling bdb with `--with-repmgr-ssl=no`, or using one of our more supported methods for installing / building against BDB which are mentioned in our build documentation.",
