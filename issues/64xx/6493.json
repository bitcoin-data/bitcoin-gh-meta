Reported via mail:\n\n> Can you, if you can, enable all accessibility features in core\n> client? Version 0.11 is not accessible especially in MacOs and Linux,\n> the last accessible version for these osses is 0.9.X. The last version\n> is accessible in Windows platform, but I prefer Mac to Windows. Can you\n> enable accessibility features for screen reader support? If you want, I\n> can test it with my iMac and Ubuntu laptop.\n> \n> In windows, all accessibility features are working, but after upgrading\n> to qt 5, the accessibility features didn't work in Mac and Linux. IN\n> Linux and Mac, I can hear window names only, for example when BitCoin\n> core is launched for a first time, I can hear welcome, but I can't\n> navigate the radio buttons and buttons for selecting, where to use\n> BitCoin folder. If I have prepared folder from Windows, I can hear Bit\n> Con Core, but I can not navigate the app. In Mac, I can navigate menus\n> only, in Linux, I can do nothing. So try to check qt-at-spi integration\n> and other accessibility modules / accessibility vidgets, but maybe there\n> is a problem with the accessibility module in qt 5 mac / linux version.\n> If the team changes something, in accessibility, please let me know and\n> I will test changes and report it.\n\nIt is possible that this improved with the switch to Qt 5.5.\n",
