   "body" : "Create a relay fee that adjusts to floods which cause the memory pool to\ngrow too large (and thus crash the node).  A periodic memory pool janitor runs, scanning the\nmemory pool total byte size.\n\nIf the memory pool is below a \"low water\" byte size limit, the\n-minrelaytxfee minimum relay fee setting is used.\n\nIf the memory pool is above a \"high water\" byte size limit, the\nminimum relay fee setting is increased according to the following\nalgorithm:\n- take the top half of the mempool in terms of fee/kb - fee rate\n- take the lowest fee rate as the minimum relay fee\n\nThe memory pool may continue to grow beyond the high water mark, though\nfees to further fill memory pools become increasingly more expensive,\nuntil new blocks reduce the pressure.\n\nThe newly increased relay fee remains intact until the memory pool\nsize falls below the \"low water\" limit.\n\nThe default \"low water\" limit is 1/2 of the supplied \"high water\" limit.\n",
