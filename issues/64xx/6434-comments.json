      "body" : "@gavinandresen looks good to me, agreed that the behavior is unexpected. A few thoughts, though:\r\n- I believe it's that way because \"-O2 -g\" are already added by default. After this change, a ```./configure --enable-debug``` will end up with duped flags I think. Not a problem really, the last flag wins.\r\n- You really want to be passing that in as ```CPPFLAGS=-DDEBUG_LOCKORDER``` anyway. Those are pre-processor flags, which exist separately so they don't get mixed up in arguments about optim flags and etc.\r\n- IMO There should be no need to pass ```-DDEBUG_LOCKORDER``` via a flag, that kinda defeats the purpose of having configure options to begin with. How about just adding ```-DDEBUG_LOCKORDER``` to CPPFLAGS in the --enable-debug case?",
