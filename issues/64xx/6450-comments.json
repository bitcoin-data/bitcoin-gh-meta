      "body" : "I've noticed this issue too on my full-RBF nodes, doubly so on the full-RBF nodes that have a higher min-relay fee set. In some cases that resulted in huge amounts of bandwidth being wasted, as those nodes are otherwise well connected with nearly the full number of peers. So strong ACK on the intent.\n\nI think we could make the table quite a bit bigger though. Each entry is about 40 bytes, so 2000 replacements is only about 80k. Equally, for the purpose of rejecting txs it'd be perfectly acceptable to only store 64bit partial txids if we first hash them with a per-node nonce, so that gets us 16bytes/entry.\n\nIf someone is trying to do a bandwidth attack by flooding the network, right now the re-requests are a pretty big multiplier - if half your ~100 incoming peers relay a tx and half don't, you've increased your incoming bandwidth used by the flood by about 50x. With the patch that's reduced drastically.\n\nNow, to defeat this protection you basically need to relay enough txs to overflow the limitedmap, before all your peers send you the associated INVs. (modulo cases where the attacker is directy connected to you) The minimum tx size is about 60 bytes, so at 1MB/second you might receive 16k txs in a really extreme case - but that overflows the map multiple times over.\n\nSpending more like, say, 5MB of RAM to mitigate that kind of bandwidth attack seems reasonable to me. w/ the existing design, that's a 125,000 entry limitedmap; if you implement the 64-bit hash idea that's a 312,000 entry limited map.\n\nAlso, would the attack be harder to pull off if dropping entries from the map was probabalistic? I suspect yes.\n",

I suspect the most likely scenario where a previously rejected transaction is now again valid will probably be validity changes due to new/reorged blocks. For instance the main reason why my #6216 pull-req causes no issues w/ relaying is that if a node receives a transaction that it rejects due to the tx being non-final, it will be accepted again later as it winds its way around the network; this pull-req might break that behavior.\n\nIf you do this it'd probably be fine to remove the time expiration entirely, saving RAM, and implement the map with a simple set with txids dropped from it randomly.\n",
