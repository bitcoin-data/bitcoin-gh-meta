Costs the attacker however many coins are in the first input, not a very interesting attack (unless part of a larger attack that requires transaction malleability to pull off).\r\n\r\n2) If the first SIGHASH_ALL input's amount is less than the transaction fee, attacker could relay/broadcast without that first input. Not very interesting, worst case the alternate lower-fee transaction gets mined, user saves some coin.\r\n\r\n3) If the wallet has TWO or more unconfirmed, multi-input transactions with exactly the same outputs (paying exactly same amount to same address-- if change is generated, then  change address/amount exactly the same for both), then there is a worrisome attack:  attacker can combine all of the SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY inputs from the transactions into one big transaction that has an oversize fee, and mine that instead of the two transactions.\r\n\r\nWe can say \"don't re-use addresses\" ... but (3) is a good reason not to merge this as-is\r\n",

The performance improvement for transactions with lots of inputs is significant, but those transactions are pretty rare.\r\n\r\nSo, to do this safely, the wallet should only sign with SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY if it knows it has never signed any other transactions with an identical set of outputs.\r\n\r\nThe naive way of doing that would be to iterate over all previous wallet 'send' transactions and check.\r\n\r\nOr the code could keep track of whether or not a brand-new change address was being used, and only use ANYONECANPAY if it was.\r\n\r\nOr the wallet could keep a bloom filter-- for each 'send' transaction in the wallet, add a hash of just the transaction's outputs to the filter. When sending a new transaction, if it's outputs don't match the bloom filter, it is safe to use ANYONECANPAY. If it does match the bloom filter, then assume it is not safe (it might be a false-positive, and that's OK).\r\n\r\nIt is not clear to me whether actually implementing that code is worth it; most wallets probably don't create transactions with lots of inputs, and maintaining the bloom filter is extra work that isn't needed in most cases.\r\n",
