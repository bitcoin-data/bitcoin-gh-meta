There's lots of other use-cases for that kind of architecture too.",

      "body" : "@luke-jr You know that most of the node operators and miners will never change a single setting. For node operators that is ok since they do it for free and maybe don't have the time/knowledge to follow all the recent developments. But even miners relay mostly an default policy (e.g. the block size increase from from 0.75 to 1 MB took quite a while and a lot of pushing).\r\n\r\n@petertodd If this setting is on default disabled, the miner who enables it is the one that needs more time for block processing. If the miner receives a block from a miner that hasn't enabled it or chose a high number for n, he will not have these tx in the mempool. Thus block verification takes longer.\r\n\r\nThats why default shouldn't be 0. It would hurt miners with a custom policy. Why not set 1 as default (works with CPFP).",
