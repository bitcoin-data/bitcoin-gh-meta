      "body" : "There are a couple of considerations to take into account here:\n1. This only prunes the blockstore, it does not keep disk usage beneath the pruning target. I think this should be called out a little more clearly.\n2. The pruning target is just that, a target, sometimes the target will be overshot a bit. Maybe this can be alluded to in the UI, or maybe it's for the release notes.\n3. Enabling pruning essentially binds a given instance to its wallet.  That is, once pruned, you can no longer import addresses, keys or wallets without a full resync.  Since this is an hours long operation, I think there should probably be some warning.\n4. Enabling pruning disables several node functions that support the network, such as historical block service and serving of proofs to SPV clients, most GUI users probably don't care, but it's a side effect.\n\nWhile there are certainly differing opinions on this, I personally believe that the pruning feature at this stage is still somewhat experimental and has side effects that only people who are paying close attention will be aware of.  With time, some of these side effects will go away or be minimized, but if there's going to be a GUI element, I think it makes sense to call this out and direct the user to the release notes.  If someone turns it on and it results in an unexpected multi-hour sync being required, that's pretty bad UX.   \n\nHonestly, I'd err on the side of requiring the user to manually supply the option in the config file as I believe users that are willing to do this are more likely to have read the release notes and fully understand the ramifications of turning it on.\n",

I don't think (3) is a problem for most users with only one wallet, but the UI could warn about potential downsides of pruning in an \"are you sure\" dialog and a tooltip. Also agree with @luke-jr that it should be made clear this is hard to reverse.

But it seems easier to just append it to `bitcoin.conf`. Two config files adds code complexity and isn't a great user experience. If any potentially problematic other settings are found in that file, QT could prompt the user to manually set `prune=`. ",

Currently that's interpreted as `prune=0` which will throw an error if the block database is actually pruned. What if instead we interpreted a missing setting as `prune=1` if blocks are pruned, `prune=0` if not pruned?\r\n\r\nIn that case, if a user enables pruning in QT and then runs `bitcoind` their chain would keep growing until either the next time they launch QT or until they explicitly set `prune` in `bitcoin.conf`.\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to kick the shared configuration file issue down the road (though I'd prefer to solve that).",
