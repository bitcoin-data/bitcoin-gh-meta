   "body" : "Currently we bucket peers (or potential peers)  based on /16 network groups  which directly correlate to the IP-addresses. This is done to diversify connections every node maintains, for example to avoid connecting to the nodes all belonging to the same region/provider.\r\n\r\nCurrently peers.dat (serialized version of addrman) does not store ip->bucket mappings explicitly, and all the known ips from peers.dat are re-hashed and re-bucketed at every restart (although it's very cheap).\r\n\r\n## Idea\r\n\r\nIt was [recently](http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2019-06-20.html) suggested by @TheBlueMatt to use ASN-based bucketing instead. This is strictly better because if the goal is to diversify connections: the distribution of IPs among the ASNs is not uniform, and because of that netgroup-based bucketing may result in having 8 peers from just 2 large ASNs. \r\nIf we allow connecting to each ASN at most once, this would increase the security of the network.\r\n\r\nWe have @sipa's script to create a compressed representation of mapping (ip->ASN), which is less than 2 megabytes.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are integration-related design questions.\r\n\r\n### Distribution of the .map file\r\n\r\nDuring the meeting there was a rough consensus (not unanimous though, @jnewbery ) that mapping file should be distributed along with the release, instead of becoming part of the binary. \r\n\r\nIf you want to question these, feel free to comment below.\r\n\r\n### Legacy /16 bucketing\r\nThere was a suggestion of having an old method as well. I think we should do it.\r\n\r\n### ~Loading the map~\r\nMaybe there will be concerns here, I have an understanding for now.",
