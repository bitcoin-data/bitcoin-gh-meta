      "body" : "0.01 is too low, it would actually get hit in practice for transactions with lots of inputs. A standard transaction can have up to about 1000 inputs. 0.01 BTC is a limit of 10s/byte for a maximum-sized standard transaction. 10s/vb is a totally reasonable feerate which is reached with some regularity.\r\n\r\nThis was originally created to address a very specific need which has largely been made obsolete by segwit and/or PSBT.  There were a number of incidents where users sent many (sometimes hundreds) of BTC to fees via the raw transaction interface... often using some web raw transaction creator because they didn't understand how fees work. It was sufficient to have a VERY high threshold which wouldn't need to be tinkered with as feerates change or the Bitcoin price changes because there was is a big gap between the mistaken \"I sent most of my coins to fees\" usage and real fees. Also because the setting didn't need to rescue every mistake in order to be a useful feature, missing some of the less significant ones was still better than nothing at all.\r\n\r\nLater, for refactoring reasons that I don't understand this functionality was spread to all transactions.  It results in weird and irritating behaviour because there aren't good ways to bypass it (like in the original sendrawtransaction usage).  However, because the limit is so high that it should never be hit the poor usability of it isn't a practical issue, but it would be if it was lowered by a factor of 10.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the maximum serves a secondary purpose of making users feel comfortable that the fees they pay are _bounded_ and that the software won't do something _really_ stupid, changing it to a feerate would not be sufficient because the number of inputs that a wallet selects is unpredictable to the user and varies over a factor of 1000.  The wallet behaviour absent this limit should be reasonable, and if it isn't that is a serious bug.  This secondary purpose is essentially just a security blanket: \"the wallet behaviour is complicated to explain so some users will obsess over fears that it will spend a hundred thousand dollars of bitcoin on fees on a single transaction by surprise and bankrupt them, the limit gives them a hard and simple (if high!) maximum so they can stop worrying about it\".\r\n\r\nA more difficult goal would be targeting a maximum fee that a user wouldn't regret spending.\r\n\r\nThe fee level that a user \"wouldn't regret\" would be something like 1000s/vb for the first couple inputs and something like the effective minimum rate (or some small multiple of it) for the rest with the rationale that the extra inputs are eventually going to need to be spent at the minimum rate or higher, so you don't care if your wallet chooses a large number of inputs if it doesn't result in paying a lot more than you could pay at a later time.  (Here, minimum rate really means something like a month long estimate... but currently the relay minimum suffices for that purpose because the network consistently has excess capacity now)\r\n\r\nBeyond the issues with configuring a regretless-rate any such rate would necessarily get triggered in practice, so the interface would have to actually handle it cleanly.
