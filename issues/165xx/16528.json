   "body" : "Introducing the wallet of the glorious future (again): native descriptor wallets. With native descriptor wallets, addresses are generated from descriptors. Instead of generating keys and deriving addresses from keys, addresses come from the scriptPubKeys produced by a descriptor. Native descriptor wallets will be optional for now and can only be created by using `createwallet`.\r\n\r\nDescriptor wallets will store descriptors, master keys from the descriptor, and descriptor cache entries. Keys are derived from descriptors on the fly. In order to allow choosing different address types, 6 descriptors are needed for normal use. There is a pair of primary and change descriptors for each of the 3 address types. With the default keypool size of 1000, each descriptor has 1000 scriptPubKeys and descriptor cache entries pregenerated. This has a side effect of making wallets large since 6000 pubkeys are written to the wallet by default, instead of the current 2000. scriptPubKeys are kept only in memory and are generated every time a descriptor is loaded. By default, we use the standard BIP 44, 49, 84 derivation paths with an external and internal derivation chain for each.\r\n\r\nDescriptors can also be imported with a new `importdescriptors` RPC.\r\n\r\nNative descriptor wallets use the `ScriptPubKeyMan` interface introduced in #16341 to add a `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan`. This defines a different IsMine which uses the simpler model of \"does this scriptPubKey exist in this wallet\". Furthermore, `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan` does not have watchonly, so with native descriptor wallets, it is not possible to have a wallet with both watchonly and non-watchonly things. Rather a wallet with `disable_private_keys` needs to be used for watchonly things.\r\n\r\nA `--descriptor` option was added to some tests (`wallet_basic.py`, `wallet_encryption.py`, `wallet_keypool.py`, `wallet_keypool_topup.py`, and `wallet_labels.py`) to allow for these tests to use descriptor wallets. Additionally, several RPCs are disabled for descriptor wallets (`importprivkey`, `importpubkey`, `importaddress`, `importmulti`, `addmultisigaddress`, `dumpprivkey`, `dumpwallet`, `importwallet`, and `sethdseed`).",
