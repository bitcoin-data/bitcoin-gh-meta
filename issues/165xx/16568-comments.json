(a lot of the code requires api lv 28 if you do not want to patch too many things)\r\n\r\nTake note i was using Qt 5.12.4 , ndk 20 and gradle 5.x. I think builds with earlier versions are probably possible but not advisable from my POV , namely because i did not have to patch much and have reached a point in the process where i can easily produce apks for armv7a and arm64-v8a.\r\n\r\nNow if i can reliably test the apks, i'll create a pull request and then maybe join in the effort to get an iOS build. \r\n",
