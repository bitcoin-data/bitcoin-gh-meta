It's clear that without `-whitelist` the test becomes extremely slow (it does pass).\r\n\r\nThat said, the title is overselling this PR a bit :-)\r\n\r\nI still don't really understand what `whitelist` is doing. It seems to have something to do with [BIP 35](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0035.mediawiki). Apparently whitelisting a node means we spam it more? I also understand it only applies to inbound nodes (see #9923).\r\n\r\nTo make it more clear / mysterious which whitelist feature this test relies on, you could set `-whitelistforcerelay=0` and `-whitelistrelay=0` (it will still run quick).",
