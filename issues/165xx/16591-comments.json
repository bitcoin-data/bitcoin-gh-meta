I'm not sure about the Italian language in Switzerland but most likely the Italian language in these two countries is more or less the same - probably even more so when speaking about IT jargon. People in Ukraine do speak russian, but I am not aware of \"their own version\" of russian language (they do have their own ukrainian language).\r\n\r\nWhat would be the reason to keep these?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'd rather focus on duplicates first and deal with other languages later.",
