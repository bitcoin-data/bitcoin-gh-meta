Unless you can demonstrate specific performance improvements, where the (possible) compaction causes bottlenecks, I strongly disagree that this is a reason to go around refactoring things.\r\n\r\nFrom a developer angle `vector<bool>` is definitely less surprising to encounter (use bools for what should be bools) and unless there's a specific reason the compaction gets in the way (serialization voodoo ?), it shouldn't be a reason for concern at all.\r\n",
