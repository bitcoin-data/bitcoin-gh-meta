   "body" : "There are too much choices in the bitcoin core translation list.\r\n\r\nSome of them are duplicates and should be removed (like `italiano (it)` and `italiano - Italia (it_IT)\r\n`, while some others do not add any value (like all the spanish translation on the screenshot below and some others).\r\n\r\nI have selected some duplicates from the Transifex page that are also duplicates in the current Bitcoin Core v18.0 selection menu:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBelarusian (be) 4,718 strings to translate 0 strings to review no translators\r\nBulgarian (Bulgaria) (bg_BG) 3,731 strings to translate 987 strings to review\r\nGreek (el) 4,588 strings to translate 130 strings to review\r\nSpanish (Spain) (es_ES) 472 strings to translate 4,246 strings to review\r\nEstonian (Estonia) (et_EE) 3,888 strings to translate 830 strings to review\r\nFrench (France) (fr_FR) 2,034 strings to translate 2,684 strings to review\r\nItalian (Italy) (it_IT) 3,464 strings to translate 1,254 strings to review\r\nRomanian (ro) 3,210 strings to translate 1,508 strings to review\r\nRussian (ru) 3,363 strings to translate 1,355 strings to review\r\nSlovenian (sl) 4,703 strings to translate 15 strings to review\r\nVietnamese (Viet Nam) (vi_VN) 3,287 strings to translate 1,431 strings to review\r\n```\r\nThese are the duplicate languages which have achieved a lower translation completion than their \"counterparts\" - for example `Belarusian (Belarus) (be_BY) 3,182 strings to translate` vs `Belarusian (be) 4,718 strings to translate`. `(be)` should therefore be removed so that other translators won't bother with translating one language two times, and so that people won't have to guess which language to select in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nThis is just a small list - there's also languages like `French (Canada)`, `Italian (Switzerland)`, `English (Canada)`, `Russian (Ukraine)` and so on on Transifex (but not in bitcoin core) which also don't add any value.\r\n\r\nThese translations should be closed on Transifex and removed from Bitcoin Core. I am not sure if removing them from Transifex would automatically remove them from Bitcoin Core next time translations are pulled or if this has to be done manually.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_53](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42591821/62894584-81825300-bd3c-11e9-9e0a-7b547e285b67.png)\r\n\r\n",
