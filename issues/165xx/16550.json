Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n\r\n**Provide a flatpak for `bitcoin-qt`**\r\n\r\nThis would provide linux users with a binary compiled from source that is distro-agnostic, this could be distributed via https://flathub.org/home.\r\n\r\nI made a flatpak manifesto that builds Bitcoin Core's binaries: https://github.com/A6GibKm/flathub/tree/org.bitcoin.bitcoin-qt. This is passes all criteria in https://github.com/flathub/flathub/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md with the exception that it gets a .patch for `clang`.\r\n",
