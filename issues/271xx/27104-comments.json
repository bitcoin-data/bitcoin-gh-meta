I'm not sure that outlawing such descriptors in the first place is a good idea.\r\n\r\nE.g. could we add a (generic) mechanism to descriptors to mark silly/dangerous/... constructions, and e.g. prevent them from being imported in wallets (except maybe with a \"force\" argument), or prevent them from being used in `deriveaddresses`. This mechanism could perhaps also be used for non-sane miniscripts.\r\n\r\nOutlawing them in descriptors in the first place may be a step too far, as as you note it breaks backward compatibility, but it may also interfere with (vaguely) sensible use cases, like somehow you got funds in such a \"bad\" descriptor-derived address... ideally nothing prevents you from spending the coins. Whatever warning/discouragement we'd want, it's too late at that point.\r\n\r\nAnother weaker argument is that in a post-#24114 world, duplicated leaves would be trivial to bypass by replacing one of the leaves with a `rawnode(HEX)` expression.",
