   "body" : "This PR aims to replace all implicit C-style const (and const+reinterpret) casts with explicit casts to improve the code's readability and maintainability.\r\n\r\nImplicit casts can cause subtle issues and can introduce undefined behavior. Explicit casting improves the code's readability and makes it easier to understand the intent of the code. Additionally, it makes it easier for developers to grep for these casts and do more substantial refactoring that may eliminate the need for casting altogether. By doing this change, it will be easier to maintain this code in the future.\r\n\r\nOverall, these changes are straightforward and only involve replacing existing code with explicit casts. The changes improve the readability and maintainability of the codebase and do not introduce any new functionality.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as this only replaces const_casts; there should be very few (if any) conflicts with other PRs.",
