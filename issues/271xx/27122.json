If however no `spent` array of spent previous `CTxOut`s is provided, some of these members will be incorrect. This option was introduced in #21365.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't actually hurt, as without prevout data, it's fundamentally impossible to generate correct BIP341 signatures anyway, and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f722a9bd132222d9d5cd503b5af25c905b205cdb/src/script/sign.cpp#L71 should prevent the logic from being used anyway.\r\n\r\nStill, don't set `m_bip341_taproot_ready` variable when we clearly don't have enough data to compute it.\r\n\r\nDiscovered by Russell O'Connor.",
