Usually, we'd use `NodeClock` for a mockable clock. `faketime` may be a way to mock the system clock in tests, but faketime may not be available on Windows.\r\n\r\nAbout the user-facing changes, this should only be an improvement:\r\n\r\n* `RandAddPeriodic` is called in the scheduler thread, so it blocking for a long time may also block shutdown, IBD, and other stuff?\r\n* `FindBestImplementation` shouldn't have any observable change, as explained in OP\r\n* `FlushStateToDisk` should not have any observable change, unless the node crashes, I guess?\r\n\r\n",
