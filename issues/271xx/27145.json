Previously when a block was disconnected any transactions that were conflicting with transactions mined in that block were not updated to be marked as inactive. The fix implemented here is described on the [Bitcoin DevWiki](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Wallet-Transaction-Conflict-Tracking#idea-refresh-conflicted). A test which tested the previous behavior has also been updated.",
