I have increased the dbcache to 8000, threads to -1 and I have disabled windows antivirus. No other program is running but still my connectivity to peers are very slow. \r\nI can see that my CPU usage is at about 2% to 10% . memory usage is also very low. so I dont know what else to do to speed it it up. \r\nsome times it speeds up but again it slows down.  Please let me know if you have any suggestion",
