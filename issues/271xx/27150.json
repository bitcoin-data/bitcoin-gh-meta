   "body" : "Add common InitConfig function to deduplicate bitcoind and bitcoin-qt code reading config files and creating the datadir.\r\n\r\nNoticed the duplicate code while reviewing #27073 and want to remove it because difference in bitcoin-qt and bitcoind behavior make it hard to evaluate changes like #27073\r\n\r\nThere are a few minor changes in behavior:\r\n\r\n- In bitcoin-qt, when there is a problem reading the configuration file, the GUI error text has changed from \"Error: Cannot parse configuration file:\" to \"Error reading configuration file:\" to be consistent with bitcoind.\r\n- In bitcoind, when there is a problem reading the settings.json file, the error text has changed from \"Failed loading settings file\" to \"Settings file could not be read\" to be consistent with bitcoin-qt.\r\n- In bitcoind, when there is a problem writing the settings.json file, the error text has changed from \"Failed saving settings file\" to \"Settings file could not be written\" to be consistent with bitcoin-qt.\r\n- In bitcoin-qt, if there datadir is not accessible (e.g. no permission to read), there is an normal error dialog showing \"Error: filesystem error: status: Permission denied [.../settings.json]\", instead of an uncaught exception.",
