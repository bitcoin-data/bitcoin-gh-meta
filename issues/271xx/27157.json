   "body" : "This addresses two outstanding comments by ryanofsky from #25574:\r\n* return `ChainstateLoadStatus::INTERRUPTED` instead of `ChainstateLoadStatus::SUCCESS`  if verification was stopped by an interrupt. This would coincide with straightforward expectation, and it avoids a misleading [log entry](https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/blob/c5825e14f8999a8c5f5121027af9e07ac51ab42e/src/init.cpp#L1526) in `init` for the block index load time (because that would include the verificiation, which didn't complete). It shouldn't affect node behavior otherwise because the shutdown signal would be caught in init anyway. In test, this would lead to an assert ([link](https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/blob/c5825e14f8999a8c5f5121027af9e07ac51ab42e/src/test/util/setup_common.cpp#L230)), which also makes more sense because benign interrupts are not expected there during init.\r\nThis can be tested by setting a large value for `-checkblocks`, interrupting the node during block verification and observing the log.\r\n https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25574#discussion_r1110050930\r\n* add documentation for `require_full_verification` https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25574#discussion_r1110031541",
