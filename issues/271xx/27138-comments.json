If it is important for the RPC client to know how many warnings have been returned in order to display them on separate lines, it seems best after this to gradually replace the `warning` string field with a `warnings` JSON array of strings, as we do in several other RPCs.  I'm happy to do that in a follow-up, as it would be orthogonal to this change: first the `warnings` field would be added and the `warning` field deprecated, then after a release or so the latter could possibly be removed.  In the meantime, this is a simple and focused fix.\r\n\r\n@pinheadmz (Thanks!) Saw those for (maybe, maybe not) another pull; prefer to keep this small and focused.",

Replacing newlines with spaces produces addled run-on paragraphs like \"Wallet will not be encrypted. Wallet created successfully.

While it is within the JSON standard to use them, unless API clients do better QA testing than Bitcoin Core it seems doubtful that clients detected the need for and added newline-delimited JSON string handling for a handful of messages out of many returned by our API. After all, we didn't, so perhaps it's a high ask. It also seems clear that a paragraph of several sentences causes less user astonishment than the same paragraph with `\\n` sequences thrown in. So it's not unlikely that this PR solves the same issue for other clients as well.  \r\n\r\nFor similar reasons, I'm not sure that adding documentation to `doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md` and/or to each of the `warning` field helps would be better than simply removing the sequences. By the time users become aware and take action, the need will be gone.\r\n\r\nI'll propose a `warnings` pull this weekend to also begin deprecating `warning` and maybe improve the `warning` helps, preferably with a fix merged for the 6-12 month interim.",
