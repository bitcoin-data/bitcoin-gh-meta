   "body" : "Would be nice to have a means of quickly getting alerted about the CI failing on a PR you authored. It's a bit cumbersome to keep an eye out on it manually, and a freshly created PR typically gets more eyes on it so having it in failing state is a bit of a waste of everyone's time. Creating this issue after brief [IRC discussion](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2023-02-28#1677593689-1677599148;).\r\n\r\nI think the main requirements are:\r\n- be able to opt out or easily ignore/hide\r\n- only get a single notification per run, not for every single job failing\r\n- low-touch, easy to maintain\r\n\r\nSome potential approaches I see:\r\n1. Use GitHub actions as [recommended](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/notifications/) by Cirrus CI documention, e.g. here's a [sample email workflow](https://github.com/cirrus-actions/email)\r\n  - can we get this to work so the PR author is notified?\r\n2. Use [`bitcoin-git`](https://github.com/gkrizek/ghi) IRC bot to DM the nickname that corresponds to the PR author's GitHub nickname\r\n  - people with a different username on IRC and GitHub would not get notifications\r\n  - to opt-out, I think users could simply use `/ignore bitcoin-git`?\r\n3. Use [drahtbot](https://github.com/marcofalke/drahtbot) to tag the author as assignee when CI fails (and remove them as assignee upon force push)\r\n  - haven't come up with an elegant way for people to opt-out of this, but arguably it's also the least intrusive option and e.g. could be filtered on the mailbox level?",
