   "body" : "Closes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2960\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core's JSONRPC server behaves with a special blend of 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 behaviors. This introduces compliance issues with more strict clients. There are the major misbehaviors that I found:\r\n- returning non-200 HTTP codes for RPC errors like \"Method not found\" (this is not a server error or an HTTP error)\r\n- returning both `\"error\"` and `\"result\"` fields together in a response object.\r\n- different behavior for single and batched RPC requests\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15495 added regression tests after a discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15381 to kinda lock in our RPC behavior to preserve backwards compatibility. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12435 was an attempt to allow strict 2.0 compliance behind a flag, but was abandoned. \r\n\r\nThe approach in this PR is not strict and preserves backwards compatibility in a familiar bitcoin-y way: all old behavior is preserved, but new rules are applied to clients that opt in. One of the rules in the [JSON RPC 2.0 spec](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#request_object) is that the kv pair `\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\"` must be present in the request. Well, let's just use that to trigger strict 2.0 behavior! When that kv pair is included in a request object, the [response will adhere to strict JSON-RPC 2.0 rules](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#response_object), essentially:\r\n\r\n- always return HTTP 200 \"OK\" unless there really is a server error or malformed request\r\n- either return `\"error\"` OR `\"result\"` but never both\r\n- same behavior for single and batch requests\r\n\r\nOpening this as a draft for now to poll for concept ACK before cleaning up the branch and finishing the work. If this is merged next steps can be:\r\n\r\n- Refactor bitcoin-cli to always use strict 2.0\r\n- Refactor the python test framework to always use strict 2.0 for everything\r\n- Begin deprecation process for 1.0/1.1 behavior (?)\r\n\r\nIf we can one day remove the old 1.0/1.1 behavior we can clean up the rpc code quite. a bit",
