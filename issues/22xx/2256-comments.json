Such attack would likely be performed by very powerful mining farms (in China?) or profiting from very low cost for energy (in Iceland or from stealing energy resources and not paying any tax, due to some abusive local privileges, or just because they have LOT of money to spend and already have very large BTC portolio to build and run fast massive mining farms, until they are the only remaining one capable with their power to mine all the remaining boins; then they will control the BTC market by emitting/spending their mass of coins when they want, and can then largely influce the trading).\r\n\r\nThis is then a problem of unfair competition in the mining industry (and probably also in the BTC trading: abusers take no risks, all others have to support the increased risks when BTC is suddenly devaluated: abusers can use that to buy again more coins).\r\n",

On the current network there is no known miner accepting non-standard transactions (probably for exactly the bug described in this issue and others). While it may be possible to reduce the time needed to verify some of such crafted transactions with caching, implementing that is non-trivial and fixing the overall issue is to the best of my knowledge impossible without a consensus change. Such a network-wide consensus changes first need to be proposed and discussed with the greater community, for example on the `bitcoin-dev` mailing list. Also, it needs a BIP to be implemented in Bitcoin Core and other software that connects to the bitcoin P2P network. So I am closing this issue for now.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I am not saying that the issue doesn't exist. The issue is real, but there is likely no trivial fix other than a consensus change. Something like \"The great consensus cleanup\" could be used as a baseline: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/7f9670b643b7c943a0cc6d2197d3eabe661050c2/bip-XXXX.mediawiki ",
