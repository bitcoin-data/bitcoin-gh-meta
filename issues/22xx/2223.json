   "body" : "At least one service that accepted zero-confirmation transactions\nwas vulnerable because an attacker could send a transaction\nwith a lock time far in the future, and then have plenty of time in\nwhich to get a double-spend mined (perhaps from a miner who wasn't\non the network when the first transaction was broadcast).\n\nThat is a variation on the \"Finney attack\". We still don't\nrecommend anybody accept 0-confirmation transactions as final\npayment for anything. This change keeps non-final transactions\nfrom appearing in the wallet, and, assuming most of the network\naccepts this change, will eventually prevent them from being relayed until\nthey are final.\n",
