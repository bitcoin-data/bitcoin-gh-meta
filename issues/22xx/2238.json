   "body" : "Some Qt strings, actually buttons like OK, Cancel, Show Details, Hide Details are displayed in English for languages like Turkish probably because Qt doesn't come with with translations for these languages. Here's an example screenshot of the encrypt wallet window:\n\n![Encrypt wallet window in Turkish](http://ompldr.org/vaGE1aA/Screenshot-C%C3%BCzdan%C4%B1%20%C5%9Fifrele.gif)\n\nThat said, it's still possible to translate these strings. That's what the Mumble team did and according to dD0T, one of the devs, codewise you'd need to apply them the same as you would with normal translations (just do another installTranslator call on the Application object -- the relevant commits for Mumble are https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/commit/e87028aea99fcbaed0e4cc004050dee83bafb47b and https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/commit/086d4a2cceb7f79006cb06f807185995843b87c8).\n\nThis is a really minor issue but I thought this report could be useful as a reminder.\n",
