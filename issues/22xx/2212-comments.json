Bitcoin does an automatic wallet salvage recovery, and future launches of Bitcoin have the same error. We only need to let users know once that \"salvage\" toasted everything except addresses, not every time.\n\nThe corrupt wallet was created by 0.3.24 on a VM that crashed while Bitcoin was running.\n",
