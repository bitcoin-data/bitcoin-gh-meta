User clicks yes, client restarts with -reindex added to the command line. For such a thing to work we would also need to re-use the current command-line parameters. And the question comes from the core, I guess if there is no need to send back the users choice to the core this could be done by extending our UI interface in a form to allow a dialogbox where we process the user choice inside the GUI code.",
