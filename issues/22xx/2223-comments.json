Unless you have a more detailed understanding of the system and know to look for the impossibly far locktime you'll think that it at least has reasonable odds.  This is misleading and makes Bitcoin even more unsafe for people in practice. Limiting them also closes down some potential areas that DOS vectors could be found.\n\nThe obvious alternatives to outright disabling themâ e.g. relaying transactions only x hours or less before they lockâ turn out to be pretty complicated to implement in the wallet (e.g. what do you do about txn whos parents were above threshold but later fall below it) and don't make an obvious improvement.\n",
