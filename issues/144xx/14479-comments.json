Perhaps someone needs to look at the generated code, but the very similar constructions on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.17.0/src/crypto/common.h#L17L54 compile to essentially no-ops.  \r\n\r\nAs far as UB goes, https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/union claims \"The details of that allocation are implementation-defined, and it's undefined behavior to read from the member of the union that wasn't most recently written. Many compilers implement, as a non-standard language extension, the ability to read inactive members of a union.\", which I believe to be true for gcc and clang. \r\n\r\nFinally, indeed it's weird that we rely on the exact memory representation of floating point numbers for serialization. However, it seems that the only place it's used (outside of tests) is for the `TxConfirmStats::decay` field, when saving/loading fee estimates to/from disk. That doesn't seem too hard to first convert to an integer or so as an independent change.",

The overall effect of that is that on BE systems, floats and doubles are byteswapped when reading/writing, which makes it incompatible across systems.\n\nThe code you suggest would not work, as it'd cast the floating point numbers semantically to integers (rounding them) rather than reinterpreting.",

      "body" : "@sipa - I was under the impression that endianess is not specified in IEEE 754 - but subject to it as it's implementation dependant. This is probably not an issue in practice as BE archs are pretty rare now. My point was that the byte ordering might be switched when loading the file on a BE float arch. I've read that even some systems have half endianess where integer are LE while 754 are BE. Anyway that is a rabbit hole and maybe out of scope here. Thanks for the response.",
