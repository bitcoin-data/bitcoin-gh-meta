Have literally gone through all wallet releases starting from 2018 down to 2013. Once downloaded, I clicked on 'receive' section and tested if that is asking for my password (note: my wallet was password protected). All wallet newer releases were still asking for my password and showed the same error described in the issue. Once I downloaded the wallet release from 2013 and clicked on the 'receive' section it stopped asking for my password.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm still downloading the blockchain files (1 year and 30 weeks left) so haven't tried to send my btc out, which will require my password to enter. Then I will be able to fully conclude this has worked. However, so far it seems like, whenever a back up was made, then btc core wallet version must by from the same year in order to work properly. This at least applies to old wallets. \r\n\r\nWill write an update once whole blockchain downloaded to confirm this solution is valid.  ",
