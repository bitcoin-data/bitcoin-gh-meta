Can you try building with the [depends system](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/depends)?\r\n\r\nAnother difference is that macOS SDK 10.11 is used for building the binaries, whereas you're on 10.12 and the most recent macOS is 10.14. I'm not sure how you can build against 10.12, other than using Gitian.",
