It is required to send coins to the lightning wallet first.  It would be a nice feature similar to btcd to allow setting the mining reward address when generating blocks.\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n17\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nOSX\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
