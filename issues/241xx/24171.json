   "body" : "When in IBD, if the honest chain is only known by inbound peers, then we must\r\neventually sync from them in order to learn it. This change allows us to\r\nperform initial headers sync and fetch blocks from inbound peers, if we have no\r\nblocks in flight.\r\n\r\nThe restriction on having no blocks in flight means that we will naturally\r\nthrottle our block downloads to any such inbound peers that we may be\r\ndownloading from, until we leave IBD. This is a tradeoff between preferring\r\noutbound peers for most of our block download, versus making sure we always\r\neventually will get blocks we need that are only known by inbound peers even\r\nduring IBD, as otherwise we may be stuck in IBD indefinitely (which could have\r\ncascading failure on the network, if a large fraction of the network managed to\r\nget stuck in IBD).\r\n\r\nNote that the test in the second commit fails on master, without the first commit.\r\n",
