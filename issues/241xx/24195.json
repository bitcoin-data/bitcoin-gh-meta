   "body" : "Fixes #23990\r\n\r\nAfter #23799, the `--failfast` option in the test runner for the functional tests stopped working, because a second outer loop was introduced, which would have needed a `break` too for the test runner to fail immediately. This also led to the errors reported in #23990.\r\n\r\nThis provides a straightforward fix for that.\r\nThere is also #23995 which is a larger refactor, but that hasn't been updated in a while to fix the failfast issue.",
