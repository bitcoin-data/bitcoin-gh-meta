Otherwise we should just go ahead and add the same change to all other packages that use pkg-config.\r\n\r\n> This PR is not about \"build with libbsd or avoid it\".

I'm not sure what you mean by restoring the previous behaviour (other than make things work), but I don't necessarily think that is the right goal. We're building a newer version of the package, that has a different build system and new (optional) dependencies.\r\n\r\n> Including libbsd in our depends build system as a zeromq package dependency\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting we do that, especially if we end up passing `--disable-libbsd`. If we pass that flag to zeromqs config opts, it will just use it's internal `strlcpy` implementation, and libbsd will no-longer a dependency.",
