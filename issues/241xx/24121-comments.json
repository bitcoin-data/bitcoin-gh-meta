Yes, some addresses are invalid - obviously - and those are well-specified I think in BIP173 and BIP350. That set can certainly change, and may need to be changed from time to time, but it's not something we can unilaterally change in the Bitcoin Core software without discussions across the ecosystem. Doing so _will_ cause stuck payments (less so than if it's done as a relay policy, but still any infrastructure depending on Bitcoin Core will see things change from under them).\r\n\r\nConcept NACK on doing anything more than a warning, unless first preceded by a wide discussion about this.",
