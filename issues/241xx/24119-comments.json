I just want more clarity regarding the former one: I have one question: do all the `except` block print the same error output?\r\nRe:\r\n> Except block directly handles BaseException. Handling 'BaseException' means that system exits and keyboard interrupts may be mis-handled.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that we want to take care of the case when there is an error generated by keyboard interrupts? And is this the only error we want to take special care of?",
