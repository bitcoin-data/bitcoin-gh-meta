   "body" : "Previously, we would check to see if we were in IBD and ignore getheaders requests accordingly. However, the IBD criteria -- an optimization mostly targeted at behavior when we have peers serving us many blocks we need to download -- is difficult to reason about in edge-case scenarios, such as if the network were to go a long time without any blocks found and nodes are getting restarted during that time.\r\n\r\nTo make things simpler to reason about, just use `nMinimumChainWork` as our anti-DoS threshold for responding to a getheaders request; as long as our chain has that much work, it should be fine to respond to a peer asking for our headers (and this should allow such a peer to request blocks from us if needed).",
