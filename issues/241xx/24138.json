   "body" : "Fixes #24076\r\n\r\nCoinstatsindex currently writes the MuHash (`DB_MUHASH`) to disk in `CoinStatsIndex::WriteBlock()` and `CoinStatsIndex::ReverseBlock()`, but the best synced block is written in `BaseIndex::Commit()`. These are called at different points in time, both during the ThreadSync phase, and also after the initial sync is finished and validation callbacks (`BlockConnected()` vs `ChainStateFlushed()`) perform the syncing.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the index DB is temporarily in an inconsistent state, and if bitcoind is terminated uncleanly (so that there is no time to call `Commit()` by receiving an interrupt or by flushing the chainstate) this leads to problems:\r\nOn the next startup, `Init()` will read the best block and a MuHash that corresponds to a different (higher) block. Indexing will  be picked up at the the best block processing some blocks again, but since MuHash is a rolling hash, it will process some utxos twice and the muhashes for all future blocks will be wrong, as was observed in #24076.\r\n\r\nFix this by always committing `DB_MUHASH` together with `DB_BEST_BLOCK`.\r\n\r\nNote that the block data for the index is still written at different times, but this does not corrupt the index - at worst, these entries will be processed another time and overwritten after an unclean shutdown and restart.",
