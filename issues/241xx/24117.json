   "body" : "When an index thread receives an interrupt during init before it got to index anything (so `m_best_block_index == nullptr` still), it will still try to commit previous \"work\" before stopping the thread. That means that `BaseIndex::CommitInternal()` calls `GetLocator(nullptr)`, which returns an locator to the tip ([code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/06b6369766137756648b3cb62c8f385cca234e69/src/chain.cpp#L31-L32)), and saves it to the index DB.\r\nOn the next startup, this locator will be read and it will be assumed that we have successfully synced the index to the tip, when in reality we have indexed nothing.\r\nIn the case of coinstatsindex, this would lead to a shutdown of bitcoind without any indication what went wrong. For the other indexes, there would be no immediate shutdown, but the index would be corrupt.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by not committing when `m_best_block_index==nullptr`, and it also adds an error log message to the silent coinstatsindex shutdown path.\r\n\r\nThis is another small bug found by `feature_init.py` - the second commit enables blockfilterindex and coinstatsindex for this test, enabling coinstatsindex without the first commit would have led to frequent failures.",
