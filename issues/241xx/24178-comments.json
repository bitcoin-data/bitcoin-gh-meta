I don't believe there's any meaningful DoS risk to us from an attacker branching the chain shortly before the current nMinimumChainWork, because even if we're fed a less work chain that forks from some recent-ish point, that won't cause us to be partitioned off the network (our peers will just think we're on some less-work but not consensus-invalid branch).\r\n\r\nMaybe I should have reframed what this PR does a bit when I opened it.  Right now, one of the criteria to leave IBD (so that `IsIBD()` returns false, and so that we would respond to getheaders requests) is having a chain with more work than `nMinimumChainWork`, so what this PR changes is that the other `IsIBD()` requirements no longer need to be met in order to start responding to getheaders requests.  The other checks done in `IsIBD()` are:\r\n\r\n```    \r\n    if (m_cached_finished_ibd.load(std::memory_order_relaxed))\r\n        return false;\r\n    if (fImporting || fReindex)\r\n        return true;\r\n    if (m_chain.Tip() == nullptr)\r\n        return true;\r\n    if (m_chain.Tip()->nChainWork < nMinimumChainWork)\r\n        return true;\r\n    if (m_chain.Tip()->GetBlockTime() < (GetTime() - nMaxTipAge))\r\n        return true;\r\n```\r\nSo what this PR is doing is not requiring the tip-age check to pass, and it's also not requiring that we're done reindexing or importing blocks from disk.  Relaxing the tip-age check is intentional and I think a better behavior in the event that block creation stalled on the network for some reason.  Now that I think about it, maybe I should re-add the guard about `fImporting || fReindex` so that we don't have peers asking to download blocks from us while we're still busy processing what we have on disk, but not sure how important that is.",

I think this is not such a big concern, as other peers would only be downloading from us if they also were new nodes, and the likelihood of a new node coming online, learning our address from someone else and then doing IBD from us in the minutes/hours(?) that we may be finishing our IBD seems small. I imagine it's more likely the inbounds we get in that window are other nodes that have been online already anyway, and won't be completing IBD from us (but instead relaying us transactions).\r\n\r\nI updated this PR so that we won't respond to the getheaders if we're importing or reindexing, and I addressed @sjors's comment about checking for nullptr as well.",
