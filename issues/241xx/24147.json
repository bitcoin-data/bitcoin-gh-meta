   "body" : " Miniscript is a language for writing (a subset of) Bitcoin Scripts in a structured way.\r\n\r\nMiniscript permits:\r\n- To safely extend the Output Descriptor language to many more scripting features thanks to the typing system (composition).\r\n- Statical analysis of spending conditions, maximum spending cost of each branch, security properties, third-party malleability.\r\n- General satisfaction of any correctly typed (\"valid\" [0]) Miniscript. The satisfaction itself is also analyzable.\r\n- To extend the possibilities of external signers, because of all of the above and since it carries enough metadata.\r\n\r\nMiniscript guarantees:\r\n- That for any statically-analyzed as \"safe\" [0] Script, a witness can be constructed in the bounds of the consensus and standardness rules (standardness complete).\r\n- That unless the conditions of the Miniscript are met, no witness can be created for the Script (consensus sound).\r\n- Third-party malleability protection for the satisfaction of a sane Miniscript, which is too complex to summarize here.\r\n\r\nFor more details around Miniscript (including the specifications), please refer to the [website](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/).\r\n\r\nMiniscript was designed by Pieter Wuille, Andrew Poelstra and Sanket Kanjalkar.\r\nThis PR is an updated and rebased version of #16800. See [the commit history of the Miniscript repository](https://github.com/sipa/miniscript/commits/master) for details about the changes made since September 2019 (TL;DR: bugfixes, introduction of timelock conflicts in the type system, `pk()` and `pkh()` aliases, `thresh_m` renamed to `multi`, all recursive algorithms were made non-recursive).\r\n\r\nThis PR is also the first in a series of 3:\r\n- The first one (here) integrates the backbone of Miniscript.\r\n- The second one (#24148) introduces support for Miniscript in Output Descriptors, allowing for watch-only support of Miniscript Descriptors in the wallet.\r\n- The third one (#24149) implements signing for these Miniscript Descriptors, using Miniscript's satisfaction algorithm. \r\n\r\nNote to reviewers:\r\n- Miniscript is currently defined only for P2WSH. No Taproot yet.\r\n- Miniscript is different from the policy language (a high-level logical representation of a spending policy). A policy->Miniscript compiler is not included here.\r\n- The fuzz target included here is more interestingly extended in the 3rd PR to check a script's satisfaction against `VerifyScript`. I think it could be further improved by having custom mutators as we now have for multisig (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23105). A minified corpus of Miniscript Scripts is available at https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/85.\r\n\r\n[0] We call \"valid\" any correctly-typed Miniscript. And \"safe\" any sane Miniscript, ie one whose satisfaction isn't malleable, which requires a key for any spending path, etc..",
