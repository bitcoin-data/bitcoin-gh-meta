I also noticed this breaks common RBF usage since the SPK conflict rejects the transaction before it can be replaced.\r\n\r\nTo address both of these, I refactored the logic so that it treats non-inherent (that is, within the same tx) SPK conflicts in the same manner as TxIn conflicts. Although in the SPK case, the RBF optin flag is ignored, and a conflict in the parents of the transaction don't cause a DoS ban.",
