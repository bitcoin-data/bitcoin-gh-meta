That's a minor problem though and if it's done consistently everywhere I have no problem with it.\r\n\r\nEdit: something else that we need to be clarify in the coding style is the use of \"override\". E.g. I had to add a few in #9764 to prevent gcc from complaining: it doesn't like when it's used inconsistently within a class.",

As for how parameters are handled, I'm of the opinion that function/method parameters should *never* be changed ever, unless they are explicitly marked as \"output parameters\", even for primitive types like ints and such, where it doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nThe primary reason is that it's much easier to read code where the input parameters always stay the same no matter what. I even prefer the following\r\n```C++\r\nvoid foo(const int inX) {\r\n   int x = inX ?: computeStartingX();\r\n   // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nover\r\n```C++\r\nvoid foo(int x) {\r\n   if (!x) x = computeStartingX();\r\n   // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich is one of the few \"ugly\" cases with this approach.",
