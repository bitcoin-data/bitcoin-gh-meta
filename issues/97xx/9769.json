(In this case it didn't appear to contain any key material, fortunately.)\r\n\r\nWe should rename these things to make this error less likely in the future, at a minimum putting the environment in a directory named 'walletdatabase' would be a big improvement.\r\n\r\nIt may have been a factor that their error said something about that BDB file, which further encouraged them to paste it... if so I'm not sure how much we can do there.",
