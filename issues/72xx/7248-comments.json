      "body" : "LevelDB happens to be much, much faster for our (somewhat strange) application - large batches that delete some large percentage of recently-written data - than almost any other non-log-structured database, so, indeed, there isnt much desire to let users use other databases which will invariably be slower. As for the issues with iSCSI on Windows, I'm not a Windows person so really have no idea where to begin looking, but trying to correlate the LevelDB failures with other activity (dedup, iSCSI disconnection, etc) would be a first step.",
