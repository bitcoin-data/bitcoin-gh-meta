Why? We may never know but perhaps it was because\nin his planning success was the only thing he could see.\n\n(See also: http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/bizarre-saga-craig-wright-latest-inventor-bitcoin )\n\nIf you were already aware of these things, then I must ask you to please\nnot waste our time in the future.  I have no interest or ability to\npersonally convince every confused person in the world about this or\nthat fine technical detail, and no one else does either.  We need to\nmake progress on the paths we believe are best right now and not allow\nunrealistic efforts to \"fix\" things forever to stall work indefinitely.\nIf you support that, you're welcome to join in.  If you don't, our work\nhas a free license that allows you to forge your own way.\n",
