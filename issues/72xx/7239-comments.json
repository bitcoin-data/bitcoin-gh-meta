So it's probably impossible to have a public key in your wallet where you don't have the corresponding private key (unless you use `impogrtaddress` or `importpubkey`).\n\nBut â if you assume your computer is compromised â nothing can stop an attack that would end up in lost/stolen coins. If you want to prevent from such attacks, create a cold storage (simple way: use a trusted offline computer, run Bitcoin-Core there, use it to keep private keys and use it for signing transactions) or use a hardware wallet.\n\nMy personal recommendation: don't keep private keys on your standard computer, even if encrypted.\n",
