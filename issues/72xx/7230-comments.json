Any sort of exponential or even linear scaling can be risky if the rate is too high or if they don't have a ceiling. I prefer to be on the safe side and not schedule any increases that we aren't fairly confident we can handle in the near term and I would prefer to not have any long term scheduled increase as the future is hard to predict. I think for this proposal we need to factor in the SegWit multiplier and hard cap it at 8MB or less.\n",

I think today's miners would definitely go along with a soft fork to reduce the block size if they felt it was necessary, but nobody wants to reduce the throughput of Bitcoin, especially large miners who benefit from larger block sizes (because it makes it more difficult for small miners to compete).\n\nYou may need a hardfork to reduce the blocksize (which means that it won't matter if the miners upgrade or not), but that would require getting all of the exchanges and merchants on board... seems pretty unlikely. Politically speaking, it seems that block size increase is a one way journey, especially because I don't think the public would recognize a 'blocks too big' crisis even mining pools stopped existing and all that was left were a small handful of datacenter miners.\n\nI also don't think that setting the blocksize to grow exponentially will solve the political arguments or permanently put the blocksize debate to rest. If you set the exponent too high, and blocksize outpaces technologies ability to keep up, you end up in a disaster where you are politically manoeuvring to have the blocksize decreased. If you set the exponent  too small, there will be obvious gaps between the capabilities of technology and the throughput of the Bitcoin network, and we'll be right back to where we started with the ongoing debate.\n\nThat said, NACK.\n\nThe segregated witness proposal I feel is a much stronger solution, is on track for quick deployment, is a soft fork that preserves compatibility with old nodes (old nodes will be able to send money, receive money, and even receive money from segwit addresses - a point I think is lost on many), and raises the effective blocksize by _nearly_ as much.\n",
