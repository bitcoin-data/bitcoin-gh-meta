   "body" : "I was attempting to add a pool payout directly to my mining pool's mempool using sendrawtransaction, however I had generated the payout with a wallet with a different dust threshold due to the pool running a significantly higher minrelaytxfee(to filter spam) than the cold wallet I use to generate batched payouts from. \n\nI got this error when I tried to send the transaction using the rpc interface and haven't found a way to override it other than adjusting minrelaytxfee on the pool's node(which isn't really a solution since CNB/GBT performance degrades significantly when the mempool gets too big). I saw there was an override but it only appeared to do anything for high fees checks.\n\n> error: {\"code\":-26,\"message\":\"64: dust\"}\n\nI think there should be a flag to only run the base validity checks on the transaction when sent through sendrawtransaction and skip the is-standard checks so that nonstandard transactions can be added to the mempool manually, maybe a way to adjust the dust thresholds independently from minrelaytxfee would also be good to have.\n",
