Since this is what defines the protocol, it seems rather odd that three fields which were introduced with protocol version 106 are treated differently.\n\nI'm not sure if you were just talking in general, which I agree with, or specifically in relation to this pull request.  If it was unclear from my initial text, this pull request is not adding any new features.  It is simply modifying the existing message to treat the extension fields consistently.\n",

Further, the client back in the protocol version 106 days will not break since it included all three fields as well thereby satisfying both the current inconsistent implementation and the proposed corrected one.\n\nHowever, I disagree on the point about it only being programmer driven OCD.  The problem is \"the code is the spec\".  As long as that is the case, I contend the code needs to accurately reflect the fact that the protocol version 106 introduced three fields, all of which are optional.  As the code is currently written, that is not the case.  It indicates that three fields were introduced, where two of the three are required if any are present, and the third is optional.  This is completely inconsistent with the rest of the \"spec\" which can easily lead to mistakes in other implementations or really anything that wants to speak the wire protocol.\n\nAll of that said, regardless of this particular pull request, I think everyone in the thread agrees that future changes should be negotiated through another mechanism.\n",
