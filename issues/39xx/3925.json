Any ideas, how we could give that translation process/handling the priority it needs? It feels really ugly and unsatisfying for translators AND users to observe untranslated strings in releases.\n\nCould we add the translation update as automatic process into the gitian build process so that we don't need to keep the translation files here on Github perhaps? Everytime a build is done fetch current TX translations...\n",
