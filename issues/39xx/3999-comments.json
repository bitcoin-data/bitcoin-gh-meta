It accesses fImporting, fReindex, chainActive, local time, ... none of which have anything to do with checkpoints. Also, it requires locking cs_main before calling because of that, making it illegal to just call from network code anyway.\n\nThe right way is adding a wrapper method in main that acquires cs_main and then calls the current implementation, and add that method to CNodeSignals. That way, net can safely call it.\n\nThe long term solution is merging net and main, and then separating the \"validation logic\" and the \"peer state logic\" to different modules. IsInitialBlockDownload would become part of the second.\n\nAlso, and independent from this: I think checkpoints should move into chainparams, and become data-only (or just disappear).\n",
