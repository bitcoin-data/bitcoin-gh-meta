It's not a dialect, it's just like spoken slang (like \"jeez\" instead of \"jesus\")...\n\nYou could compare it to en_us and en_uk, e.g. like if you would translate the en_uk \"OK/Cancel\" buttons to \"OK dude!\"/\"Jeez, sod off!\". This example looks us english (i think at least, sorry its not my mother language), but totally slang and therefore I see the de_at translation as completely unappropriate.\n\nI don't say anything against fun/joke translations like \"pirate\" etc.. But not as a serious translation for 9 mio normal people, which just have set their OS language to de_at, just because they live in austria.\nI was really scared when i started 0.9 the first time, because I thought there is something criminal (virus, manipulated binary,...) happening.\n\n@cs, @musha68k can you confirm this maybe?\n",

I think the difference between en_us and en_uk are much bigger than de and de_at.\n",
