      "body" : "I have the same opinion. But I'll write it from the beginning. Let's describe what happens now with the current master.\n\nWhen the user first starts bitcoind, ~/.bitcoin is created and this is filled in:\n\n``` shell\npavel@linux-hshf:~/.bitcoin> l\ntotal 4\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 pavel users   88 Nov  6 11:15 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 pavel users  172 Nov  6 11:15 ../\ndrwx------ 1 pavel users   58 Nov  6 11:15 blocks/\ndrwx------ 1 pavel users   78 Nov  6 11:15 chainstate/\ndrwx------ 1 pavel users   28 Nov  6 11:15 database/\n-rw------- 1 pavel users    0 Nov  6 11:15 db.log\n-rw------- 1 pavel users 2059 Nov  6 11:15 debug.log\n-rw------- 1 pavel users    0 Nov  6 11:15 .lock\npavel@linux-hshf:~/.bitcoin> \n```\n\nbitcoind prints this at the first run:\n\n``` shell\npavel@linux-hshf:~/bitcoin/src> ./bitcoind \nError: To use the \"-server\" option, you must set a rpcpassword in the configuration file:\n/home/pavel/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf\nIt is recommended you use the following random password:\nrpcuser=bitcoinrpc\nrpcpassword=EwJeV3fZTyTVozdECF627BkBMnNDwQaVLakG3A4wXYyk\n(you do not need to remember this password)\nThe username and password MUST NOT be the same.\nIf the file does not exist, create it with owner-readable-only file permissions.\nIt is also recommended to set alertnotify so you are notified of problems;\nfor example: alertnotify=echo %s | mail -s \"Bitcoin Alert\" admin@foo.com\npavel@linux-hshf:~/bitcoin/src> \n```\n\nSo we are pre-filling the user directory and print him texts he could (we even recommend that) fill in the bitcoind.conf. This is quite good, but it would me more user friendly to pre-fill also these infos to the newly created bitcoind.conf. He still have to do something, but we could make it a lot easier for him if we pre-fill the file with this info, e.g. in this particular run of bitcoind, the bitcoin.conf file would end up with this:\n\n``` shell\n# Generated rpcuser and rpcpassword\nrpcuser=bitcoinrpc\nrpcpassword=EwJeV3fZTyTVozdECF627BkBMnNDwQaVLakG3A4wXYyk\n```\n\nI also think that the rest of the start message (alertnotify example) could go to this file (with maybe even more comments and samples) instead of printing it to the user. He is trying to run bitcoind for the first time (without arguments as I did above), doesn't have rpcuser/password set up, so why bother him with the alertnotify at all?\n\nSo in the future, it could work as follows:\n\n``` shell\n$ ./bitcoind\nWarning: rpcuser and rpcpassword were generated for your convenience (you can change it in ~/.bitcoin/bitcoind.conf).\n```\n\n... and bitcoind is running.\n",
