But there is no reason future versions of bitcoin core, or other clients, couldn't support I2P with ports. So I'm kind of divided on ignoring them completely, as that will give problems with such addresses not propagating later.

With the original version of this PR, it would have been easy to implement that - as soon as bitcoind supports non-port-0 I2P addresses, just remove the line from `IsValidForAddrman()` that disallows them.\r\n\r\nIn any case, #22497 was opened shortly after this PR and quickly merged, removing all of the I2P-specific code from addrman, so I've dropped the first commit.\r\n\r\n> This PR seems to be complicating the already complicated Unserialize().
