For CLI usage you'll have to specify the wallet name, unless only a single wallet is loaded.\r\n\r\n> Allow the receiver to confirm his wallet BEFORE the transfer-confirmation\r\n\r\nThis is already possible by just sending the raw transaction out-of-band of the P2P network. It can't be sent on the P2P network because miners would then claim the tx fee. The receiver could then broadcast the tx if everything checks out.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative you could use Lightning.",
