This makes sense because tracking that information for every received block would slow down the process too much.\r\n\r\nProposed solution: If one of the startup tasks were to identify the blockheight at which tracking fees would become useful, then the process could start tracking them once the blockheight was there.  Otherwise, other layers that rely on `estimatesmartfee` (like ACINQ's Eclair Lightning node) have to wait an extra hour even though bitcoind has all the information it needs.\r\n\r\nIf there is information required by `estaimatesmartfee` that is not available to a node which has just finished downloading the blockchain, please add a comment explaining what it is.",
