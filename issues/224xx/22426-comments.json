A reliable 1TB 7200rpm drive.\r\n\r\nAbout the hardware defects suggestion, I remember trying it on two different computers and had the same issue. Likelihood of a hardware issue is very low in my opinion because im still using both computers a year later with other intensive tasks such as VMs and video encoding with no issues.\r\n\r\nAs for whether or not this would still be an issue in a newer version, I could not say because I abandoned that project because I could not get it running properly. I would have to try again today to be sure. \r\n\r\nIf you'd rather close the issue, I don't mind!    \r\n\r\nCheers,",
