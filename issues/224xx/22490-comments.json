      "body" : "@mzumsande- did you consider the approach of adding `-connect=0` as a command line arg in the TestNode initializer ([aka around here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/da1c0c64fd094880712d1c4167ad9eb3bb6ffcc6/test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py#L97))?\r\n\r\nI'm thinking something like\r\n```\r\n        if not any(\"-connect\" in s for s in self.extra_args):\r\n            self.args.append(\"-connect=0\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen looking at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22098#issuecomment-889842332, I realized that test doesn't actually need rebase or an exception added, because passing in something like `self.start_node(0, [\"-connect=fakenodeaddr\"])` from the individual test appends the `-connect` arg as a command-line argument, which overrules what's been set in the .conf file. \r\n\r\nSo this means the tests setting `self.disable_autoconnect` would sometimes be unnecessary?\r\n\r\nI think my proposed alternative could simplify the test framework code (don't have to pass around the `disable_autoconnect` param), and reduce overhead when implementing an individual test (don't have to set an additional field, can just pass `-connect=whatever`). But I didn't fully hash this out, so I easily could be missing something. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think? ",
