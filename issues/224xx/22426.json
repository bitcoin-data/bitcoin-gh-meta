   "body" : "Hi,\r\n\r\nThis is the first time i was using BitCoin Core and syncing.\r\n\r\nDescribe the issue:  the software fails to sync 100%.  It fails around 2020 with the error message \"error reading from database. shutting down\". Tried restarting a couple times, it makes some more progress then stops somewhere else.\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you expect?   As a first time user I was expecting this to go smooth and sync to be successful.\r\n\r\nHow reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so?   Yes every time I restart it will hit an issue when syncing 2020 and stop.\r\n\r\nWhat version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)?  I am using the portable version in a zip file, for windows, version 0.21.1\r\n\r\nI also checked that the download I used was the right checksum and signed with the right key.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? This is a windows 10 computer with Intel i7-6700HQ\r\n\r\nHere are the logs for the latest occurrence:\r\n\r\n2021-07-11T02:00:10Z LevelDB read failure: Corruption: block checksum mismatch: D:\\BitcoinLedger\\chainstate/209877.ldb\r\n2021-07-11T02:00:10Z Fatal LevelDB error: Corruption: block checksum mismatch: D:\\BitcoinLedger\\chainstate/209877.ldb\r\n2021-07-11T02:00:10Z You can use -debug=leveldb to get more complete diagnostic messages\r\n2021-07-11T02:00:10Z Error: Error reading from database, shutting down.\r\n2021-07-11T02:00:15Z Error reading from database: Fatal LevelDB error: Corruption: block checksum mismatch: D:\\BitcoinLedger\\chainstate/209877.ldb\r\n\r\n\r\nI checked my computer for hard drive corruption issues. Copied 50Gbs back and forth with checksum no errors. Memory also checks ok.\r\n\r\nWhen I search the whole logs, the corruption message is always about 209877...  Is there a way I can force a re-download or something?\r\n",
