      "body" : "If I've understood this correctly, this is making it impossible for the original wallet to spend the dirty coins (only the sub wallet can spend the dirty coins) in comparison to the current state where the original wallet only spends the dirty coins when there is no other alternative. Hence with subwallets a payment would fail if it needed dirty UTXOs to get up to the payment amount.\r\n\r\nThis does create some challenges (code and UX) as at the very least the user would want to be informed that they have enough funds to make the payment across the original wallet and the sub wallet. And I would guess the user would want the option to go ahead with the payment despite it spending dirty UTXOs. Hence you would need to introduce some logic across the subwallet and the original wallet which leads to the question why were they separated in the first place?\r\n\r\n",
