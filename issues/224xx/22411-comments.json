If that assumption fails, rate limiting a single RPC isn't going to provide any meaningful benefit.\r\n* The P2P \"interface\" is public and untrusted. Thus, any rate limit can simply be patched out by the bad actor. Any rate limiting would need to be applied at the receiver side. However, as no other message types (even unknown message types, such as `pyng`) are rate limited, rate limiting a single P2P message type isn't going to provide any meaningful benefit either.",
