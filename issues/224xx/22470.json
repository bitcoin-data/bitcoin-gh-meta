This is a dedicated issue to track it independently because it is a different problem than the one reported in #22450 OP/description.\r\n\r\n> If the same I2P address appears in multiple new buckets, then the first time this loop finds that address, it'll update the port and reposition it in that bucket. Any subsequent times that the address is encountered, it will already have had its port updated so the inner loop will `continue` ...\r\n\r\nThanks, @jnewbery!",
