   "body" : "To somewhat ease the transition from gitian to guix, this PR replaces the previous gitian descriptors with ones that perform the guix build.\r\n\r\nDue to the way guix works, some changes were needed to gitian itself, so builders must make sure that their gitian is up to date before trying this. Additionally, the base gitian images may need to be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nI have only tested this using docker (with some changes to gitian: https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder/pull/251). It is my understanding that @luke-jr has been able to get these to work using kvm. I have tried with lxc but was unable to make it work.\r\n\r\nThe previous gitian descriptors used Ubuntu Focal as the image base. However because gitian is unable to make such images for lxc and kvm, the base image used here is Bionic.",
