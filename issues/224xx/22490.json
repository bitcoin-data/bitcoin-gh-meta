   "body" : "A node normally doesn't make automatic connections to peers in the functional tests because neither DNS seeds nor hardcoded peers are available on regtest. However, when random entries are inserted into addrman as part of a functional test (e.g. while testing addr relay), `ThreadOpenConnections` will periodically try to connect to them, resulting in log entries such as:\r\n`[opencon] [net.cpp:400] [ConnectNode] trying connection 18.166.1.1:8333 lastseen=0.0hrs`\r\n\r\nI don't think it's desirable that functional tests try to connect to random computers on the internet, aside from the possibility that at some point in time someone out there might actually answer in a way to ruin a test.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this problem by disabling  `ThreadOpenConnections` by adding `-connect=0` to the default args, and adding exceptions only when needed for the test to pass.",
