After that it only took about 10 minutes to get back up to ~800 (after restarting bitcoind), although about 80% of my addnodes were instantly disconnecting me.\n\nhttp://5.9.24.81/lollercopter.txt\n\nAs the only reason I initially started running bitcoind on the server was for p2pool and I no longer use p2pool, I guess now is as good a time as any to shut it down.  I'd rather use that server for video encoding & torrenting anyway (gbit connection and all).  Maybe mess around on my kimsufi pos.\n\nBut, yeah...
