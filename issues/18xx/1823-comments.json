If a Satoshi client get's such a compact number it will pass it to CBigNum.getuint256, which will ignore the sign and thus interpret the compact number `0x08812345` as `0x0123450000000000` instead of `0x8123450000000000`.\n\nHowever, none of the implementations I've looked at actually generates such compact numbers and my proposed rewrite still makes sure not to generate them either.  The effect of the rewrite is that ''if'' a future implementation would produce such a number it would be interpreted in the most likely intended way instead of effectively stripping the bit in a convoluted way.\n\nThe reason for proposing this change is that I'm going through the bignum and base58 implementation extending the test-suite and simplifying the implementation.  This weird behavior of `SetCompact` was the first to trip-up my tests.\n\nIf we come to the conclusion not to accept this change, I'll change the test-suite accordingly.\n",
