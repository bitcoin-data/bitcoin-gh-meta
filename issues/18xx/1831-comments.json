It would mess up the pretty little state machine in `parseCommandLine` though...\n- Either that, or go all the way and integrate a Javascript interpreter using QScript. One could use normal function calls, ie `createrawtransaction([{...}], \"test\")`. You could even store the return values and use them in a next call, or run them through a script first. But I'm somewhat wary of pulling in a  script interpreter, as it will increase the attack surface.\n\nNah... this is very low priority, the console is already useful and I'm not sure that we need to make it even more developer friendly :-) Hmm... Or maybe that's the future niche of Bitcoin-Qt, \"the debug client\", as Sipa is talking about directing normal users to faster lightweight clients already.\n",
