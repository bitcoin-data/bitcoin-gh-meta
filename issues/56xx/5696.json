   "body" : "This is blocking #6051 and #5595\n\nThere's no way to start moving consensus and policy code effectively out of main without creating a first .h file.\n\nUPDATE:\nIt was initially a tiny first step to sepearate consensus and policy but afer a lot of discussion it ended up being a tiny step towards separating only more consensus.\n\nThe motivation for this PR is stop blocking the 2 PRs mentioned in line 1.\n\nOUTDATED (for archive):\n\nWhile we discuss what the CPolicy interface should be #5595, we can start by just moving constants and globals to consensus.h and policy.o.\nThis will also open the door to some cleaning up on the includes.\nnMaxDatacarrierBytes and MAX_OP_RETURN_RELAY are not moved from script/standard.o to policy.o because policy.o is in server while script/standard.o is in common and wouldn't link.\n\nPlease propose any other constant or global variable related to consensus or policy that I may have missed.\n\nNew but irrelevant:\nAre you still reading?\n\nThis PR is so simple that the following comments are equivalent:\n- utACK\n- ACK\n- ACK: I didn't read the code but I fully tested in all ways I could think of and it doesn't seem to break anything.\n- I didn't tested it but I did finally read the code.\n",
