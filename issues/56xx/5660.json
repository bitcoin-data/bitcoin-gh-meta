   "body" : "I noticed that one of my Statoshi fork nodes (up-to-date with Bitcoin commit 4f73a8f64d1555b4053f2a0a5c79083e50a0ce21) got stuck at block height 338832: \nhttp://statoshi.info/#/dashboard/db/blocks?panelId=1&fullscreen&from=1421176623670&to=1421207099532\n\nThe Statoshi fork doesn't have any functional changes to the protocol; this shouldn't be a bug in Statoshi. Also, my other Statoshi nodes have continued running without getting stuck. \n\nHere's my debug log from the period during which the block height became stuck: http://pastebin.com/9bk4ptfA\n\nThe node is still receiving block messages but doesn't seem to be processing them - I don't see any updateTip messages or block error messages in the log. I'm not sure what to make of this.\n",
