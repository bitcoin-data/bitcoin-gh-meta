      "body" : "This patch serves no purpose other than providing a \"hack\" around a flaw in the Bitcoin core. Previously OpenSSL did not look for invalid DER encoded data with possible trailing garbage but in the latest version it does. The actual problem is that Bitcoin accepts invalid DER encoded signatures and this is completely unrelated to OpenSSL. Now you are taking the invalid-DER encoded data and DER encoding it before calling ECDSA_verify. Because of this the same operation will be performed twice for every signature verification wasting CPU cycles. You MUST always DER encode your signature before passing it off to OpenSSL and this is nothing new. So this being \"low\" on OpenSSL's list is correct from my expert opinion as it is only performing validation and Bitcoin is passing invalid data.\n\nECDSA_verify:\n\n```\nint ECDSA_verify(int type, const unsigned char *dgst, int dgst_len,\n    const unsigned char *sigbuf, int sig_len, EC_KEY *eckey)\n{\nECDSA_SIG *s;\nconst unsigned char *p = sigbuf;\nunsigned char *der = NULL;\nint derlen = -1;\nint ret=-1;\n\ns = ECDSA_SIG_new();\nif (s == NULL) return(ret);\nif (d2i_ECDSA_SIG(&s, &p, sig_len) == NULL) goto err;\n/* Ensure signature uses DER and doesn't have trailing garbage */\nderlen = i2d_ECDSA_SIG(s, &der);\nif (derlen != sig_len || memcmp(sigbuf, der, derlen))\n    goto err;\nret=ECDSA_do_verify(dgst, dgst_len, s, eckey);\nerr:\nif (derlen > 0)\n    {\n    OPENSSL_cleanse(der, derlen);\n    OPENSSL_free(der);\n    }\nECDSA_SIG_free(s);\nreturn(ret);\n}\n```\n",

For example, encoding R and S with leading zeros.  This is substantive, non-backwards compatible, arguably somewhat under-disclosed (seems that you were also unaware of the actual change, in that you refer to it as \"trailing garbage\"), breaking API change from the existing and widely known behavior.  Signatures come from the outside world (Bitcoin Core itself has never generated anything but strictly minimal encodings), and the decoding functions are OpenSSL internal.  As a result previously accepted encodings (and not just 'trailing garbage') will be rejected.  \n\nWhile this may not matter for most applications, a switch to be more conservative is not something that can be done in an uncoordinated way for a consensus system without resulting in an opening for funds loss. This is just the state of things, and not a question of \"flaw\" or blame.

Note that a hardfork (or even a softfork) to fix this is not something we can do overnight, as we do not have any kind of authoritative control the protocol: making a change requires the consensus of every Bitcoin user, and coordination of that is a time consuming process that generally takes months.\n\nNote that with Bitcoin (and I imagine most scenarios you'd be verifying a signature!), signatures are from an external source, so you can't say \"just encode them right\"... any signature-checking code really should assume the signature is untrusted data and possibly an attempt to perform a remote exploit.\n\nAlso note that Bitcoin Core has itself generated only DER-compatible signatures for a long time.\n",

I'd generally be happy to educate you (or anyone else), but your continued antagonism is tiring.  In this case; You're complaining about not using DER encoding for data which cannot be DER encoded and is never passed to a function that expects DER encoding.\n\n> So please explain why signature verification is failing?\n\nBecause while Bitcoin core generates and has always generated strictly encoded valid DER for transactions, third party implementations such as Armory, Blockchain.info, and MTGOX (among many others) previously generated signatures with excessive padding (e.g. additional leading zeros inside R and S instead of the shortest possible encoding). From time to time old (or new) instances of this continue to crop up. In the past the establish software, based on OpenSSL, accepted these signatures since OpenSSL provided no method to distinguish these signatures from a non-excessively padded signature and it happily decoded them. The updated OpenSSL decodes and reencodes the signatures and the result is a shorter encoding, which it rejects.\n\nBecause Bitcoin is a consensus system all participants must agree on if a particular string of bytes is valid signature or not, or the blockchain can diverge as a result of their disagreement.\n\n> can't happen\n\nThis simple concept of what can and cannot happen based on what Bitcoin Core would send is too narrow for working in a public network, especially under adversarial conditions. Any sequence of bits that can be sent, probably will be sent, especially if they trigger interesting behavior.\n",

The code in question appears to check the nullness of the pointer and allocates only if null, meaning the documentation is actually dangerously incorrect (since if you believed the documentation you may send uninitialized memory in there and have it fail to allocate).\n\nThanks for noticing th documentation disagreed, previously I'd just valgrinded and checked the code.\n",
