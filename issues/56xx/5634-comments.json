      "body" : "This patch serves no purpose other than providing a \"hack\" around a flaw in the Bitcoin core. Previously OpenSSL did not look for invalid DER encoded data with possible trailing garbage but in the latest version it does. The actual problem is that Bitcoin accepts invalid DER encoded signatures and this is completely unrelated to OpenSSL. Now you are taking the invalid-DER encoded data and DER encoding it before calling ECDSA_verify. Because of this the same operation will be performed twice for every signature verification wasting CPU cycles. You MUST always DER encode your signature before passing it off to OpenSSL and this is nothing new. So this being \"low\" on OpenSSL's list is correct from my expert opinion as it is only performing validation and Bitcoin is passing invalid data.\r\n\r\nECDSA_verify:\r\n\r\n    int ECDSA_verify(int type, const unsigned char *dgst, int dgst_len,\r\n\t\tconst unsigned char *sigbuf, int sig_len, EC_KEY *eckey)\r\n \t{\r\n\tECDSA_SIG *s;\r\n\tconst unsigned char *p = sigbuf;\r\n\tunsigned char *der = NULL;\r\n\tint derlen = -1;\r\n\tint ret=-1;\r\n\r\n\ts = ECDSA_SIG_new();\r\n\tif (s == NULL) return(ret);\r\n\tif (d2i_ECDSA_SIG(&s, &p, sig_len) == NULL) goto err;\r\n\t/* Ensure signature uses DER and doesn't have trailing garbage */\r\n\tderlen = i2d_ECDSA_SIG(s, &der);\r\n\tif (derlen != sig_len || memcmp(sigbuf, der, derlen))\r\n\t\tgoto err;\r\n\tret=ECDSA_do_verify(dgst, dgst_len, s, eckey);\r\n    err:\r\n\tif (derlen > 0)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\tOPENSSL_cleanse(der, derlen);\r\n\t\tOPENSSL_free(der);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\tECDSA_SIG_free(s);\r\n\treturn(ret);\r\n\t}\r\n",

Note that a hardfork (or even a softfork) to fix this is not something we can do overnight, as we do not have any kind of authoritative control the protocol: making a change requires the consensus of every Bitcoin user, and coordination of that is a time consuming process that generally takes months.\r\n\r\nNote that with Bitcoin (and I imagine most scenarios you'd be verifying a signature!), signatures are from an external source, so you can't say \"just encode them right\"... any signature-checking code really should assume the signature is untrusted data and possibly an attempt to perform a remote exploit.\r\n\r\nAlso note that Bitcoin Core has itself generated only DER-compatible signatures for a long time.",

OpenSSL provides a verify function which takes a string of bytes with an already encoded signature from the outside world. This is its documented behavior, and it's how OpenSSL itself uses it.  I would be surprised if you were able to find a _single_ prior user of that function which pre-parsed to verify or re-encoded the inputs before handing them to OpenSSL.\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, we have had work in progress previously to reduce the systems dependence on OpenSSL's behavior here.

I'd generally be happy to educate you (or anyone else), but your continued antagonism is tiring.  In this case; You're complaining about not using DER encoding for data which cannot be DER encoded and is never passed to a function that expects DER encoding.\r\n\r\n> So please explain why signature verification is failing?\r\n\r\nBecause while Bitcoin core generates and has always generated strictly encoded valid DER for transactions, third party implementations such as Armory, Blockchain.info, and MTGOX (among many others) previously generated signatures with excessive padding (e.g. additional leading zeros inside R and S instead of the shortest possible encoding). From time to time old (or new) instances of this continue to crop up. In the past the establish software, based on OpenSSL, accepted these signatures since OpenSSL provided no method to distinguish these signatures from a non-excessively padded signature and it happily decoded them. The updated OpenSSL decodes and reencodes the signatures and the result is a shorter encoding, which it rejects.\r\n\r\nBecause Bitcoin is a consensus system all participants must agree on if a particular string of bytes is valid signature or not, or the blockchain can diverge as a result of their disagreement.\r\n\r\n> can't happen\r\n\r\nThis simple concept of what can and cannot happen based on what Bitcoin Core would send is too narrow for working in a public network, especially under adversarial conditions. Any sequence of bits that can be sent, probably will be sent, especially if they trigger interesting behavior.",
