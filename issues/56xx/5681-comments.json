Right now it's kind of a mess that doesn't even pass the tests, but if you're curious, here's my latest branch on that: https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commits/consensus_policy\nI guess it mostly falls into the \"d\" category, with a little bit of \"a\" as you move constants and globals out.\nThis (and therefore #5669 and the longest branch) needed rebase.\nI'm also trying to isolate a good small base for policy to use as an example and confirm what I think @luke-jr and I (and hopefully everyone) can agree on.\n",
