The thing is that the two systems have very different install paradigms. OS X is \"drag (what looks like) this one file/blob into place\", while Windows is \"run this installer, it puts everything in the right place, updates it if needed, and registers with the system\". I would personally think that adding it to OS X (if that's possible, I don't know much about OS X's apps-that-are-really-directories-but-pretend-to-be-files-in-Finder-and-magically-start-the-right-executable structure) would be preferable to removing them from Windows, because for Windows users like myself, having the exe be in a specific place and auto-updated is nice, and I assume that it would be the same for OS X users, with the ability to have a single update action that updates everything in place, with all paths remaining as-is. So from that standpoint, I think I would vote for adding the extras to OS X rather than dropping them from Windows. But I don't know if this kind of change is too big to go in between RCs. If so, I would say that we should add bitcoin-tx.exe for now, sticking with the current practice of shipping all the bins (other than the tests) in the installer.\n",

Due to our reliance on static linking, every additional executable, even simple utilities add a lot of weight.\n\nIn all the time we've shipped MacOSX releases, almost one ever complained about there not being a separate bitcoind/bitcoin-cli. The few people I know that need them (such as @rktoomey) prefer them as separate executables in a  .zip, because they can be easier integrated into scripting/testing workflows. So I'd argue against including them in the dmg. 99% of users won't even realize they are there and they're just dead-weight.\n\nI'm not against adding bitcoin-tx to the Windows installer, but my experience is that most windows users won't be using command line utilities, because they prefer clicking but also because the windows cmd.exe is terrible to use as a shell.\n",
