After all, it is successful if it is already in.\n\nEventually I didn't do that, to keep some compatibility with the old behavior. It's reasonably useful in some cases to know when a transaction already landed in the chain, and if not you can ignore the specific error code.\n\n(I would argue it's misuse of an exception and returning a {'inchain':X, 'inmempool':X, 'txhash':X} structure would be more informative, but alas, that'd mean changing the interface to be even more incompatible)\n",
