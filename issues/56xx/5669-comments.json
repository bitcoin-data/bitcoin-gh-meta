Maybe it's not a big deal, let's see what others say about it. There's other potential optimizations there (for example, if every individual tx.vout[i].nValue is positive, nValueOut cannot be negative).\r\n\r\n@theuni Yes, the point of the namespace was to avoid naming these functions ConsensusCheckTransaction(), etc. But I'm fine also changing the name. What about Consensus::CheckTx() ?\r\n\r\n@Both of you, I agree that ConsensusException is not the most elegant thing in the world as it is now. @Diapolo proposes to unify functionIn and strErrorIn into maybe descriptionIn. That makes sense. I would prefer not putting there anything at all. Remember that this is only for the log. Would it be much worse if instead of using ```error(e.what())``` we just used ```error(\"Consensus::CheckTransaction: %s\", e.reason)``` in \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5669/files#diff-7ec3c68a81efff79b6ca22ac1f1eabbaR817\r\n??\r\nInstead of logging \"CheckTransaction() : vin empty\" we would log \"CheckTransaction() : bad-txns-vin-empty\" and things like that. If you ask me, it is worth it if it allows us to remove an attribute of the object (be it an exception or a returned object).\r\nAbout not throwing Exceptions, I was trying to avoid many i/o parameters like int& nDoS and std::string& reason, but it is true that returning an object would do it.\r\nSome errors have nDoS = 10 and most of them have 100. If they all had 100, we could save another attribute for the object. or return bool and have a string& reason param. or return the reason string and treat an empty string as success check...We can have something more beauty if we're willing to minimally change functionality.\r\n \r\n",

      "body" : "Yesterday I realized that the result object should be more generic to be used by other consensus functions. Also it would be useful for some policy methods.\r\nI concluded that the simplest thing would be to mimic CValidationState::DoS() header: \r\nhttps://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/9e67b59d52834fb7b52ad9e3b428117c35d28822 and https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/e92e852413c4c8418edd872230710570c4a6fc6f\r\n\r\nBut your approach is definitely simpler. The only disadvantage being the lack of an error string to be passed and thus changing a little bit the logging.\r\nFor example, instead of logging ```ERROR: Consensus::CheckTx(): vin empty``` your approach would log ```ERROR: Consensus::CheckTx(): bad-txns-vin-empty``` instead.\r\nBecause the reason contained in the state it's different from the string passed to ```bool error(char*)``` called to return false for the second parameter of CValidationState::DoS().\r\nIn my opinion this is completely acceptable and will also make those calls to CValidationState::DoS() shorter. We will still need to touch those lines to remove the call to error(), but everything will be simpler to do and review.\r\n\r\nSo I think I'm going to redo this on top of an edited version of your commit.\r\n ",

I'm thankful to @jgarzik that C's include philosophy is to include everything that you're using, not just the higher level files. I hope that he can give some time to #5681 to make sure I didn't learned anything the wrong way.\r\nI'm also trying to keep in sync https://github.com/luke-jr/bitcoin/compare/nodepolicy2 and #5180.\r\nI hope reviewers don't get mad because I'm using #5681 as a common base for some seemingly unrelated previous proposals, but I believe they will become much easier to maintain.\r\nI needed that to know which ```#include \"main.h\"``` I could really delete when moving things out of main in parallel.\r\nI'll push my longest consensus/policy-related branch soon. If it doesn't make any sense to anyone I can go back to a version without #5681 on the consensus and policy related PRs I have. I may close some of them with some acks to if it makes more sense to concentrate related changes.\r\n \r\n  ",
