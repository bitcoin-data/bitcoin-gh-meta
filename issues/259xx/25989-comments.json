That being said, I'd be fine with a warning too, but in that case we probably should also just warn in the `-onlynet=onion` case.\r\nI think it would be best to wait for the discussion in #24991 (which is more important than this PR and hopefully gets into 24.0, because it fixes a bug) and adapt this to PR to imitate whatever approach was chosen there.\r\n\r\n> (...) and it could set up `-i2psam` / `-cjdnsreachable` for me (like a \"`SoftSetBoolArg`\") if I chose one of them in `-onlynet`.
