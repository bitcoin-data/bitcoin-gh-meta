Also, no correction will happen if your time drifts after you made more than `BITCOIN_TIMEDATA_MAX_SAMPLES/2+1` distinct honest outbound connections. Instead of a false promise that adjusted time will correct an incorrect system clock, it would be better for the system operator to correct the system clock.\r\n\r\nI don't see a way that adjusted time can be helping some without also harming others. Every instance where it provides a \"fix\" for some users, it opens the attack surface for users that are not affected by the problem. For example, if an attacker can influence enough (not all) outgoing connections of your node, they can likely get you out of consensus with a perfectly synced system clock. This also breaks the assumption that a single honest connection would be sufficient for you to stay in consensus.\r\n\r\n",

Also, no correction will happen if your time drifts after you made more than BITCOIN_TIMEDATA_MAX_SAMPLES/2+1 distinct honest outbound connections. Instead of a false promise that adjusted time will correct an incorrect system clock, it would be better for the system operator to correct the system clock.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, there is at least a correction brought to your system clock once you have at most 4 distinct honest outbound connections and before you have made more than BITCOIN_TIMEDATA_MAX_SAMPLES/2+1, which I think made my point correct that the existence of a correction hardens the attack game for an adversary targeting your NTP syncing, even minimally. Noting this correction is featherweight if you're facing an adversary with BGP capabilities, I don't deny it.\r\n\r\nI would agree a better protection would be effectively for the system operator to correct the system clock, a good question being if we can achieve this at the bitcoind-level with a warning system potentially based on peers clocks, or we should recommend high-stakes users to be their own stratum 0 servers, and directly get time from GPS or a non-Internet time source.\r\n\r\n> For example, if an attacker can influence enough (not all) outgoing connections of your node, they can likely get you out of consensus with a perfectly synced system clock. \r\n\r\nAssuming you're starting with a perfectly synced system clock, as we're bounded with `DEFAULT_MAX_TIME_ADJUSTEMENT`, of an effective value of 70min, the attacker won't be able to make you reject block due to seen timestamp being too far in the future. From my comprehension, current adjusted time does not break the assumption that a single honest connection would be sufficient to stay in consensus.  ",
