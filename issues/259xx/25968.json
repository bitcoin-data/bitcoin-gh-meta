   "body" : "This contains a list of most-unrelated simplifications and optimizations to the code merged in #25717:\r\n* **Make `ProcessNextHeaders` replace the headers argument**: this allows reusing the same vector storage for input and output headers to `HeadersSync::ProcessNextHeaders`. I find it also natural in the sense that this argument just represents the headers-to-be-processed, both in the caller and the callee, and both before and after the calls.\r\n* **Make `ProcessNextHeaders` support empty headers message**: remove the special case in `ProcessHeadersMessage` dealing with empty headers messages, and instead let `HeadersSync` deal with it correctly.\r\n* **Simplify `TryLowWorkHeadersSync` invocation**: make use of the fact that now `TryLowWorkHeadersSync` is (like `IsContinuationOfLowWorkHeadersSync`) an operation that partially processes headers, it can be invoked in a similar way, bailing out when there is nothing left to do.\r\n* **Avoid an `IsAncestorOfBestHeaderOrTip` call**: just don't call this function when it won't have any effect\r\n* **Compute work from headers without `CBlockIndex`**: avoid the need to construct a `CBlockIndex` object just to compute work for a header, when its `nBits` value suffices for that. Also use some `Span`s where possible.\r\n* **Remove useless `CBlock::GetBlockHeader` (it inherits from it)**: There is no need for a function to convert a `CBlock` to a `CBlockHeader`, as it's a child class of it.\r\n\r\nThese are not reactions to review feedback, and isn't intended for 24.0.",
