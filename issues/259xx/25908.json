This PR removes the notion of adjusted time, along with the `-maxtimeadjustment` option. It doesn't do any other cleanup.\r\n\r\nOpening for discussion of gotchas / brainstorming / concept (N)ACKs.\r\n\r\n1 question from a reviewer was whether we should keep some sort of warning around for if our clock differs too much from our peers. Although it's unclear how useful that might be.\r\n\r\nCommits can be cleaned up / sqaushed. Missing release notes etc.\r\nWould close #4521.",
