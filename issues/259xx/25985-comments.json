You can just compare a build with system libs, vs a depends build, as [sqlite as compiled via brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/b2381b8146258ea40e08b634fd693defdd957748/Formula/sqlite.rb#L32), is going to be ~the same as the lib you get when compiling in depends.\r\n\r\nLooking at the macOS sqlite system lib, it's pretty clear that it contains code that isn't in the open source sqlite. There are a number of additional symbols, including `__sqlite3_apple_archive, __sqlite3_apple_archive_type, __sqlite3_apple_unarchive, __sqlite3_purgeEligiblePagerCacheMemory` etc. As well as `_sqlite3_key, _sqlite3_key_v2`, which indicate the presence of non-free sqlite extensions, such as [The SQLite Encryption Extension](https://sqlite.org/com/see.html).",

This isn't being used in the release binaries. It's for developers/users self-compiling on macos.

Homebrew just [compiles the unmodified sqlite source](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/sqlite.rb), there is nothing to \"fix\" there.

If we actually had those changes, we could also be applying them in depends (and fixing this for releases).\r\n\r\n> If users want to use Apple's sqlite, they can use the same approach. No code change is required at all.\r\n\r\nSo you suggest we leave this as-is, and just continually tell downstream projects / confused devs that to get reasonable performance in their developer environments, they have to compile differently, and avoid homebrews sqlite, even though our build system is setup to prefer it by default?\r\n\r\nHere's another instance of a project, this time BDK, running into this same problem: https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/issues/749.",

The original example was larger and took 30 seconds vs 3 seconds. The problem is also that downstream software which imports many descriptors may run into RPC client timeouts (although arguably that's a problem with their RPC client). Also this performance issue effects other things too, although they are less directly measurable.",
