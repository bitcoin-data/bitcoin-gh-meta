   "body" : "Without specifying a feerate, we let the wallet decide on an appropriate feerate, which can be influenced by various factors\r\nsuch as what's in the mempool. Since wallet_groups.py fails when feerates are unstable, we should use a fixed feerate across all nodes. The assumed feerate was 20 sats/vbyte, so this PR adopts that.\r\n\r\nCloses #25940. I'm not 100% sure, but I think the increased tx relay speed introduced by #25865 caused the transactions to more quickly and often enter the other nodes' mempools, affecting their feerate calculation done in [`wallet:GetMinimumFeeRate()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ea67232cdb80c4bc3f16fcd823f6f811fd8903e1/src/wallet/fees.cpp#L68-L72) and thus deviating slightly from the expected 20 sats/vbyte.\r\n\r\nRan `wallet_groups.py` over 150 times without failure.\r\n",
