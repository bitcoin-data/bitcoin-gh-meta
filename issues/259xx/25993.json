   "body" : "The first commit adds some general guidance on restricting I2P traffic bandwidth which in my experience can be higher than expected by default (74GB in 24h measured using default `i2pd` config for example).\r\n\r\nThe second commit changes this section to an `i2pd`-specific one and adds a section on minimum recommended software version to a version which fixes a clock error preventing `i2pd` from starting.\r\n\r\nI think both of these two sections will help others set up I2P more easily and so are worth adding, but also happy to drop the second commit if we want to keep I2P.md guidance Core-related or general I2P.",
