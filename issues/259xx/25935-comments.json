      "body" : "> Including the config file example in the root of the build output can suggest that editing it will have an effect on the running program.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is true, and it is pretty clear in the documentation in the repo that you must move the config file to the datadir. For example, the file itself starts with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n##\r\n## bitcoin.conf configuration file.\r\n## Generated by contrib/devtools/gen-bitcoin-conf.sh.\r\n##\r\n## Lines beginning with # are comments.\r\n## All possible configuration options are provided. To use, copy this file\r\n## to your data directory (default or specified by -datadir), uncomment\r\n## options you would like to change, and save the file.\r\n##\r\n```\r\n\r\n> By moving it into share/examples/, its status as an example is clear.\r\n\r\nTechnically, this file isn't an example, but a fully commented-out config file. Back when I wrote the script, the old config file was an example, and I didn't think that hard about it (which is why the script generates the file in `share/examples`), but I think for the release/build outputs it's more correct to have it in the root directory to 1) make it easier for the user to find it and 2) be clear that it is not an example config but a full config",
