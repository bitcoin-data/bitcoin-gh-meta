   "body" : "The [gen-manpages.sh](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/devtools/gen-manpages.sh) generates UNIX manual pages based on the `-help` output from the binairies that result from the build.\r\n\r\nThis means that the options documented vary based on the build system settings. In the manual pages that are checked in, we would like to document as many options as possible.\r\n\r\nIdeally the script needs to check for:\r\n\r\n- `HAVE_SYSTEM` so that `-alertnotify` and other notifications are documented\r\n- `ENABLE_WALLET` so that wallet specific arguments are documented\r\n- `USE_UPNP` so that UPnP arguments are documented\r\n- `ENABLE_ZMQ` so that ZMQ arguments are documented\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to generate the manual page from the source code instead (e.g. pick up and parse `AddArg`). This is much more complicated, though, due to use of `strprintf` and such.\r\n\r\n## Good first issue\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\r\n\r\nUseful skills: *shell scripting*\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this. You are encouraged to comment on the issue if you are planning to work on it.
