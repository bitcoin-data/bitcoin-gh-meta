   "body" : "At the moment, in case of block disconnection, if any conflicting transaction was inside, we don't undo conflicts on wallet transactions, i.e they stay in state `CONFLICTED` instead of being marked again as `UNCONFIRMED`. This shortcoming causes inaccurate balance computation and blocks the user from re-submitting the tx back to the mempool. \r\n\r\nCurrently, if conflicted transaction was later confirmed, the status is updated accordingly and nothing changes. This PR undoes conflict(s) and also cleans up some of `MarkConflicted` which is renamed `UpdatedConflicts` to cover both instances of unconfirmed to conflicted and conflicted to unconfirmed cases. \r\n\r\nLambda is used, but I'm open to other approaches.\r\n\r\n",
