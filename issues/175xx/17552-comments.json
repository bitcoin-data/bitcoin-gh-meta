Everyone should run them after compiling Bitcoin Core. For the gitian builds, I do this on all platforms: mac, win, linux.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to user testing, every user has their own use case for Bitcoin Core, so beside running the unit and functional tests, they should read the release notes and run their own integration tests (e.g. \"Is my RPC wrapper still up to date with the all RPC changes\") every time they update Bitcoin Core.",

For example:\r\n\r\n> they should read the release notes and run their own integration tests (e.g. \"Is my RPC wrapper still up to date with the all RPC changes\") every time they update Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nThis is probably one of **the most important things** to include in the recommendations.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm suggesting is just some documentation on possible testing methodologies/tools, and that might belong in another repo, but it'd be nice to have a place to share and improve this information.",
