All other settings (non-x86_64 hardware or non-ubuntu docker, such as debian), it would slow down. I'd guess that the default amd64 mirrors for ubuntu are over-used, whereas the others are not. So downloading in parallel will help to saturate the connection to the amd64 ubuntu mirror.\r\n\r\nAlso, for some unknown reasons, `s390x` is the fastest to download new software (and possibly also run the whole build on travis).\r\n\r\nSo we might want to switch to `s390x` for our native builds to try if that speeds up things on travis.\r\n\r\nFor local runs of the ci system, we'd need to implement some caching mechanism. Even just supporting to cache depends and the ccache would speed up local runs. A custom docker image might also speed things up, but we'd need to make sure that the image is provided for all our supported archs, not only x86_64. I don't know enough about docker on how to achieve that.",
