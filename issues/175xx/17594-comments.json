That being said for a project like Bitcoin Core where catching problems far outweighs rapid development cycles it does seem justified.\r\n\r\nAs I'm writing I have just succeeded in porting the appveyor job to Github Actions and have run a successful build (minus tests). It looks like build time and maintenance overhead will be approximately the same as appveyor but the [usage limits](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-github-actions#usage-limits) do look a lot more appealing. If it does support 20 concurrent CI jobs that could significantly improve the situation for Bitcoin Core PR writers waiting for the build results.",

I have it configured in a branch on my fork and will leave it running. As far as I can tell it couldn't do any harm to enable it on the main Bitcoin repo. It doesn't need to be integrated into the PR workflow. It would be interesting to see how the build queue performed with a trigger for PR's. \r\n\r\nIf there's interest I can create a PR for the job.\r\n\r\n",
