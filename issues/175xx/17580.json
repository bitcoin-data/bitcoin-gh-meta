It is just supposed to enforce internal consistency and prevent bugs by ensuring that list arguments are always retrieved with GetArgs() and non-list arguments are always retrieved with GetArg(). Followup PRs could use the ALLOW_LIST flags for better documentation and error checking in the future. For example, #17493 builds on this to disallow conflicting config values. \r\n\r\nThis change was originally made as part of #17493\r\n",
