   "body" : "#17290 introduced a bug where, when we had preset inputs that covered the amount being sent and subtractFeeFrromOutputs was being used, transaction funding would result in a `Fee exceeds maximum configured by -maxtxfee` error. This was happening because we weren't setting `bnb_used = false` when the preset inputs were used as it should have been. This resulted in a too high fee because the change would go to fees accidentally.\r\n\r\nApparently this particular case doesn't have a test, so I've added one as well.",
