      "body" : "I don't think I am not able to reproduce the issue with the info you provided. First of all, the `getaddressinfo` output is not a multisig address but a P2WPKH address (visible in the `desc` field). Then, I also need more info on other commands you have run and what the background of the keys is. Are all the keys controlled by your wallet or not? Did you import the multisig address into your wallet?\r\n\r\nIn general you will probably want to to import the multisig address and then run `listunspent` with watchonly included. See this test as an example of how you can probably achieve what you are trying to do: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3e949380725ca32be6c9812a926727b0a45723a9/test/functional/wallet_listtransactions.py#L94. Also note there that this does wait for one confirmation but I if you remove this ([commenting out this line](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3e949380725ca32be6c9812a926727b0a45723a9/test/functional/wallet_listtransactions.py#L98)) then the test still succeeds.",
