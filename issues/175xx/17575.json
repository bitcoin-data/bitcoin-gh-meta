So showing this column title would make this more obvious.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think hiding the column title only for privkey-disabled wallets breaks the harmonic looking of the wallet GUI.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I once heard that some scammers who once made use of the watch-only wallet feature provided by Bitcoin Core to take misleading screenshots, for example, to pretend as if they were OG miners who had participated Bitcoin mining in very early stage.",
