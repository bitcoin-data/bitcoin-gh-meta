This wasn't the case when the duplicate checking skipping was added, but it is the case now. I can't imagine that the PR to skip the \"redundant\" duplicate check would have gone through if it wasn't on the block propagation critical path then, so I can't see a change that is 10x+ more complicated being adopted now that its off the critical path.\r\n\r\nThis adds hundreds of lines of code and a homebrew cryptographic hash that AFAICT isn't particularly cryptographic but if broken turns into a DOS attack (and no, XORing a seed is does not obviously produce pairwise independence, which some approximation of is required to achieve the claimed property that a bad input for one user would be okay for others),  -- and it looks like doesn't actually result in an observable benefit except on microbenchmarks.  \r\n\r\nNAK.",

In any case, our goal isn't really to validate a maliciously created block quickly, it is to validate an honestly created block as quickly as possible and a maliciously created block in tolerable time -- I figured that they O(N / log(N)) speedup to switch back to the set algorithm upon collision wasn't worth the added complexity there, but it can certainly be done.  \r\n\r\nThe PCG I am using is not homebrew (except in implementation). If you prefer, we could add a dependency to the standard PCG library which contains a similar function. Thus the unstudied portion is mostly limited to the inputs to the function. My understanding of PCG is such that the xor'd seed should produce pairwise independence, although I grant you that it may be better to use two different seeds k1_1 and k1_2.

Adding complexity to the consensus code (or, as I often argue, changing it at all) should be something we do for only very good reasons, both because of the high review burden consensus code changes incur on the project, and because of the maintenance burden and cognitive load we put on future developers as well. \r\n\r\nI really don't think we should consider making consensus code changes that are designed to have no effect but prep the way for unspecified future code changes (which is why I often chime in with a Concept NACK on consensus refactoring PRs).  These incur all the review and testing costs of a consensus change, but by design have no benefit to the network.  This project is way too busy for this to be a good use of developer effort IMO.\r\n\r\nIn my view, if we're going to make changes to the consensus code for performance reasons, then (a) those performance numbers should be demonstrably and meaningfully better for the network, and (b) we should generally discuss all the designs that might achieve the same performance benefit, and have a very good reason for not choosing the simplest such design.  In the case of this change, the performance benefits could likely be realized by far simpler changes, as has been pointed out in the review comments on other versions of this PR.\r\n\r\nI do think that it would be a useful discussion to figure out exactly what would be the simplest code design for where the duplicate inputs check should live -- I've had some offline conversations and in my view it's not obvious whether it should naturally be considered a context-free check we perform on transactions, or whether the check should reside instead at the utxo database layer.  If we care to improve the underlying issue here, I think we would best served by engaging in that design discussion to come up with the simplest way of reasoning about things in the future.\r\n\r\nFinally -- I think we should remember that we're not just writing code for ourselves, but for hopefully a much larger set of future engineers.  If we are going to burden people with complicated reasoning about a consensus topic, it should be because it's really important.",

      "body" : "@sdaftuar Thanks for the review and feedback.\r\n\r\n1. Understood. It's often times hard to tell the borderline between small-steps that are easy to reason about and sweeping changes which change lots of code. I tend to err on the side of small steps with easy to reason about changes because when things are larger I perceive there's more of a rejection for review simply because of large amount of changes required, even if it is decomposed into small steps. I also tend to prefer to do small steps so as not to invest to much effort on an approach that will not be acceptable early on.\r\n1. I can clarify the types of changes I'm excited about that this opens up the door to in a bit. I do have drafts of them, but I'm still thinking about how to best structure them to make the project benefit maximally. I'm happy to give you a preview.\r\n1. The differences between this approach and a simpler version (I also have an implementation of it which checks both duplicate inputs and longchain order) is somewhat substantial. But perhaps that difference would be less clear once the broader architecture changes are done -- happy to explore this as well. Also the simpler approaches mentioned in the other iteration do not have the same property that this one does (longchain checking) and cannot be augmented easily to support it (it becomes a separate check).\r\n1. This sounds like a good conversation. I have some opinions on this, but am not strongly attached. I don't have a horse in the race on weather they are contextual or non contextual checks -- either is somewhat fine to me, but I do feel strongly that duplicate input checks are not a per-transaction check (they are block wide). I also _believe_ from a performance perspective, they are best performed in ConnectBlock after the first Control.add and before Control.wait. From a code fragility perspective, I would prefer this check to happen before the UTXO database or caching hierarchy is written to *at all*. These two goals are slightly at odds, but there might be a way to make them work nicely together.\r\n1. I do believe this code is actually *much simpler* than the current state of affairs. Currently, where are duplicate inputs checked?  They are checked in two places -- per txn in check block, and then across transactions but not within transactions in ConnectBlock. That's what lead to the CVE. Changing the code to only perform the check in once place explicitly is dramatically simpler.  Reasoning about this is simpler. Now, the hashtable implementation, I agree, is more complicated, which is why I wrote a detailed comment. If performance is sacrificable a bit here as it's no longer in the hot path at all, I would prefer the slightly less performant version as it doesn't need as much convincing for the reader. When working on the broader change which can follow this PR, I will base it on that simpler version.\r\n1. I've always heard the project was scratch your own itch ;) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell, will let you know when I have something ready. I do think that the belt-and-suspendering the check holds merit; I will include the simplest version possible in that version, to the extent it isn't worse than master.\r\n\r\nDo you have a falsifiable framework for testing this sort of change? I'd like to produce a testable change where I can demonstrate a change in an environment that you're happy with. Would it be -reindex-chainstate with assumevalid set to one month prior? Is there something simpler that would work and be convincing & permit more rapid iteration?",
