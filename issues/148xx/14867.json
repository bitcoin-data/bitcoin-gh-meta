   "body" : "I cannot find discussion on it and I am not sure if I understand it properly, so first let me try to explain what I understand it to be:\r\n\r\nIf I spend an unconfirmed transaction that has and output that' been spent over `limitdescendantcount` times, then my transaction will not be accepted in the mempool.  \r\n\r\nIf this is correct, then why does it make sense to have this limitation? Why does the descendant count of the transaction I want to spend have anything to do with my transaction?\r\n\r\nThe reason why I ask this is, because this was recently used to (intentionally or not) DoS attack coinjoins in Wasabi: https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/904\r\n\r\nAlso note, increasing the limit is not a solution, because they can just make that many more transactions. What I will do is to refuse the registration from the transaction after he first disrupted the coinjoin, but I would like to understand why the limitation is there in the first place or if I even understand this correctly.",
