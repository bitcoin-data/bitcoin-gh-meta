ZMQ is a nice complement, and I can use it to determine the chaintip update event, but would much prefer it in a deserialized format. Assuming I don't want to \"roll my own\" parser:\r\n- No unnecessary roundtrip from an additional RPC call (`getblock`)\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is a bit of bias in the prior discussion, since experts @luke-jr and @dcousens dismissed it as \"easy to implement\". I think there is an important question raised:\r\n\r\n> However, if ease of application development is not a priority for the project, then sure - happy to close.\r\n\r\nThe tradeoffs seem to favor having an option for JSON, since we already serve JSON over RPC.",
