Why not just `acknowledge_deprecated=true` all the time?  \r\n\r\nIf I'd be a developer, I would prefer releasing software that doesn't break user software, even when if the user updates its underlying Core instance.  \r\n\r\nThus, I'd keep sending `acknowledge_deprecated=true` flag preemptively, even for calls I think would never be changed, just to be sure, because what is the downside? Nothing really.  \r\n\r\nIt must also be noted that the difference between `acknowledge_deprecated=true` and `-deprecatedrpc=<methodname>` is that, the developer may not want to (or can) mess up with `-deprecatedrpc=<methodname>` lines the config file for all rpc command it uses before the RPC would break. That just smells like a very dirty solution, compared to setting a simple flag true.  \r\n\r\nAnyhow, I'm not arguing for or against here, just giving some feedback on how the change would be used.",
