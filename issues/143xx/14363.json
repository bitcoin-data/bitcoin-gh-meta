   "body" : "At the time of writing approximately [86.51%](http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/security.html?201817144) of the Bitcoin network is vulnerable to [CVE-20181-7144.](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2018/09/20/notice/) It has been two weeks since 0.16.3 was tagged with the vulnerability fix.  \r\n\r\nI believe the occasional [breaking of user space](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25954270/what-does-it-mean-to-break-user-space) is one of the contributing factor to this situation where things can be improved. I believe marking an RPC method deprecated and removing it within a few new releases may not be sufficient, since most developers do not code directly against Bitcoin Core, rather they take an RPC client implementation, written by someone else in their respective programming language. These projects tend to be unmaintained, incomplete, and sometimes even buggy.  \r\nThese developers, in such an environment may consider upgrading their Core nodes to be too risky.\r\n\r\nI know it is hard living together with legacy code and immature API design decisions, but a \"never break the user space\" policy may result in a more secure and stable environment.",
