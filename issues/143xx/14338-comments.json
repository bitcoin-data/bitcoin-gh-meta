      "body" : "It's actually a great API, it's just poorly understood.\r\n\r\nLet's say you consider 100 confirmations to be set-in-stone (probably pretty reasonable).  So really what you want to do is ask core \"Tell me everything that's happened in the last 100 blocks\".\r\n\r\nBut that makes for a terrible API, because if your software goes down for a while  -- you'll miss shit. So what you really want to do is say:\r\n\r\n\"Give me all transactions that have happened since $SET_IN_STONE\"  and then after you process that, you want to update $SET_IN_STONE, which should be 100 confirmations before the current best block. \r\n\r\nFrom an application point of view, it's much nicer to do that atomically.  And that's exactly what `listsinceblock` does. \r\n\r\nWe can write some psuedo code:\r\n```\r\nset_in_stone :=  \"genesis block hash\"\r\nwhile true {\r\n       transactions, new_set_in_stone :=  listsinceblock(set_in_stone, 100)\r\n       process(transactions)\r\n       set_in_stone = new_set_in_stone\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the _actual_ problem with `listsinceblock` is just how badly tested and undefined it is (especially around things like unconfirmed/double-spends). I forgot the exact details but I once had a processing system (including double-spend detection) with it working perfectly, then the behaviors silently broke, and then I fixed that and then it irreparably broke etc. I couldn't rely on something so unstable, so I had to just implement the exact same feature myself -- so I can't tell you ow usable it is or not.\r\n\r\n",
