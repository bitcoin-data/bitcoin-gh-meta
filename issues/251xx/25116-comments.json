If people spot tests failures they should open issues. If other people see the same thing / can provide more info, they can comment on them. If eventually they can't be reproduced / disappear, the issue can be closed. Consolidating all of that into a single thread doesn't seem like it's going to improve things, other than be quite confusing / noisy.",

And even if you think that you understand it, some of the failures (e.g. issues with the fee estimation algorithm such as #23165 / #21161 ) are very nontrivial to fix properly.\r\nIt's tempting to go for the easy way of just softening the test assumptions a bit to remove the flakiness and be able to forget about it, but the proper approach of understanding why the test failed (and whether the root cause is in the test code or the code under test) can  be hard - and I think that's the bottleneck, not the tracking.",
