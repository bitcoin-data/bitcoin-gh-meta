   "body" : "This makes two improvements to the index init phase:\r\n\r\n**1) Prevent index corruption in case a reorg happens when the index was switched off**:\r\nThis is done by reading in the top block stored in the locator instead of looking for a fork point already in `BaseIndex::Init()`.\r\nBefore, we'd just go back to the fork point by calling `FindForkInGlobalIndex()`, which would have corrupted the coinstatsindex because its saved muhash needs to be reverted step by step by un-applying all blocks in between, which wasn't done before. This is now being done a bit later in  `ThreadSync()`, which has existing logic to call the custom `Rewind()` method when going back along the chain to the forking point (thanks ryanofsky for pointing this out to me!).\r\n\r\n**2) Allow using the `-reindex-chainstate` option without needing to disabling indexes**:\r\nWith `BaseIndex::Init()` not calling `FindForkInGlobalIndex()` anymore, we can allow `reindex-chainstate` with active indexes. `reindex-chainstate` deletes the chain and rebuilds it later in `ThreadImport`, so there is no chain available during `BaseIndex::Init()`, which would lead to problems (see #24789).\r\nBut now we'll only need the chain a bit later in `BaseIndex::ThreadSync`, which will wait for the reindex-chainstate in `ThreadImport` to finish and will continue syncing after that.",
