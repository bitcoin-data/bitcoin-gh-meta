If someone knows how to reproduce the fixed failure behaviour on a Linux/BSD system, would be nice to know.\r\n\r\nAgree, it would be nice to be sure :) My assumption is that the Windows build is just slower than everything else and that's why we have only seen it there so far. Looking at https://cirrus-ci.com/github/bitcoin/bitcoin it always seems the be the job that takes the longest time.",

It doesn't seem to use threading and since it's only available for testing I thought something like this should be it's primary use-case. I confirmed it works with your hint mentioned above.\r\n\r\n> Why not use connect_nodes which has the wait_until built into? [#25031 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25031#issuecomment-1125306199)\r\n\r\nRight, I can replace `addconnection` here with `connect_nodes`, I didn't remember `connect_nodes` has the wait built into it. It looks a little less efficient (calling more RPCs under the hood) but saves us another line for the ip+port in the test, so I am indifferent between the two. I just didn't like the one-liner in that link because it's harder to read and would require a comment to explain that this is a clunky way to protect against a potential race condition.",
