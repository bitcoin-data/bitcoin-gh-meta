   "body" : "This PR separates the storage abstraction layer (e.g., leveldb layer) from the bitcoin core application layer. This has many benefits:\r\n\r\n- Easier testing for the bitcoin core application layer without requiring an open database\r\n- Easier replacement for the storage library in case it's decided to do it in the future with a simple implementation of an interface\r\n- Ensure that any other future implementations can live to the same standard we have now by testing different implementations the same way\r\n- Better interface description to understand the expectations from the implementations of the interface\r\n- Much easier bench-marking separate from serialization\r\n\r\nThis change has caused zero modification to the bitcoin core application source code, as I deliberately maintained everything from the outside. This change is a drop-in replacement to everything that uses leveldb.\r\n\r\nThings I failed to do without breaking backwards compatibility, so I skipped:\r\n- Use DBIndex to decide the prefix of the storage. The problem here is that some key/value database systems provide other mechanisms for separating between different database \"tables\", so to say. In our case, we use a `char` as a prefix. For example, lmdb provides an integer index. The problem here is that when keys are submitted as a Span, prepending a prefix is a relatively expensive operation as it requires copying the whole key. I don't see how we can do this without that. This is a conflict between the serialization and the storage layer that I couldn't resolve.\r\n\r\nThings I'd love to achieve in the next PR(s):\r\n- ~Create an in-memory database that can easily replace leveldb and assist in tests~ (Given that tests use in-memory db as was pointed out in the comments, we may or may not do this)\r\n- Move the block and block-undo storage behind this interface and use DBIndex as a way to tell the implementation how to store the data (in files or in leveldb)\r\n",
