      "body" : "I think the 2nd example (the one in the GUI) is a good example that this is a bug because: 1) the crash can cause data loss, 2) it goes beyond the scope of thinking that everything in the data directory has to be writable by the node because it deals with a directory outside of the bitcoin node's data directory. For that one, if you don't set the env var `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, like I did to make the test easily reproducible and lightweight, then the default will try to create `$HOME/.config/autostart`, if it does not exist. If this ends up not being considered a bug, then we should definitely document that having write permissions available on `$HOME/.config` is a prereq for bitcoin-qt to not crash suddenly.",
