   "body" : "The logging timer has many issues:\r\n\r\n* The underlying clock is mockable, meaning that benchmarks are useless when mocktime was set at the beginning or end of the benchmark.\r\n* The underlying clock is not monotonic, meaning that benchmarks are useless when the system time was changed during the benchmark.\r\n* The precision is set at compile time, meaning that benchmarks are useless when the precision isn't fine enough to cover the duration. Also, if the precision is too fine, benchmarks will be confusing and pretend a precision that doesn't exist. I think at best a relative precision of 1% can be assumed. There is one argument *for* a fixed precision, as it makes debug log parsers slightly easier.\r\n\r\nFix all issues in this patch.",
