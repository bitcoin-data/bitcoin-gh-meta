I just added it on my Core fork so you can test it as well. See: https://github.com/brunoerg/bitcoin/blob/2022-04-universal-mutation/test/mutation/mutation.py\r\n\r\nPros: Use regex for mutation, scriptable, can be used in CI (although I think we shouldn't btw) and the module to analyze the mutations is very good. We can set different \"functional/unit/whatever\" script for each file we've mutated (some libs/apps only allow you to set one script so it will be used for all mutations, this is bad because we don't want to execute `test_runner ` ou `make check` for each mutation). See [here](\" https://github.com/brunoerg/bitcoin/blob/2022-04-universal-mutation/test/mutation/mutation.py\") I have a dictionary where I put the file to be mutated and the functional test to test it.\r\n\r\nCons: It's not focused 100% on C++ - it's a generalist tool, I had to open a PR to include some C++ rules.\r\n\r\n---------\r\nI've also been testing [mutate_cpp](https://github.com/nlohmann/mutate_cpp) and I'll give my feedback here soon.",
