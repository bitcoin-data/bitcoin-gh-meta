In the past we've rejected features that add more fully fledged log management to `bitcoind` because, outside trivial usage, it's better to leave this to some dedicate external system such as `logrotate`.\r\n\r\nThis adds an extra command line option that adds configuration complexity, and also needs tests.\r\n\r\nIn your specific case I'd have recommended to disable the log shrinking completely for the duration of the experiment. Then you're 100% sure to not lose data, where heuristically choosing a new number does not.",
