I'm not even fully onboard on the idea that LevelDB is part of the \"consensus layer\", but I understand that LevelDB is part of the consensus library; after all it's a key/value store and it should be just that. The solution to this fear, however, is not keeping it untouched (because it was touched before, quite often over the last decade). But the solution is to quantify how it works and make it part of the protocol and run proper tests, like it has always been done in this repo. \r\n\r\nAnd I'm happy to do more to make this PR more appealing and address any concerns, whether it's tests or something else.

Quite frankly I'm a little disappointed that no one cared, which is OK, but let's not get ahead of ourselves adding more code and work before people show the least interest. \r\n\r\nAnd to get on the practicality train, the reviewer can see now there's abstract interfaces now for storage and iteration over storage, which can be used to define behavior or even mock the storage to simulate errors with something like gmock. It's not hard to see how interface-behavior can be well-defined and tested.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n",
