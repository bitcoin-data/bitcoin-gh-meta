   "body" : "Boost Process is currently relatively poorly maintained; bugs are remaining unfixed for multiple Boost releases, the code and issue tracking is [confusingly](https://github.com/boostorg/process/pull/243) spread across multiple repositories, see https://github.com/boostorg/process/ and https://github.com/klemens-morgenstern/boost-process), which themselves each have different versions of the code.\r\n\r\nThere's been no recent \"modernization\" of the module, i.e an option use `std::filesystem` over `boost::filesystem`, like other Boost modules, which is why we no-longer support external signing on Windows, see #24065. \r\n\r\nIt's inclusion in our project is also a downside to our Boost consolidation / removal, i.e #24742, as Process's own dependencies (filesystem, system, win-api, + others) pull in even more Boost modules (i.e asio), which in turn pull in further modules..\r\n\r\nIf we are going to continue to use/expand our usage of it, I think we need some sort of plan, addressing the above, rather than leaving it ignored while we start accumulating workarounds, i.e #24523, in our own code to support it, and it's presence potentially blocks other project goals.\r\n\r\nOne potential alternative is https://github.com/arun11299/cpp-subprocess.",
