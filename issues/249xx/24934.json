   "body" : "In `CreateNewBlock` (in miner.cpp), `inBlock` is cleared before `addPackageTxs`, so `inBlock` will be empty in the first call to `UpdatePackagesForAdded`. I saw this brought up in these [PR review club logs](https://bitcoincore.reviews/24538) and there didn't seem to be a definitive answer for why the call is necessary. There's also an [old PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10200) where this change was going to be applied, but it got closed.\r\n\r\nIf `addPackageTxs` can be called when `inBlock` is not empty, then maybe a test should be added for that case. All the tests seem to pass with this deletion.",
