You could also decide to replace an old transaction in the superblock if a new transaction has the same inputs, but higher priority. At first glance, this will mitigate the problem of transactions getting stuck in the mempool.\n\nHowever, it would also be a really good way to have dynamic fees, as planned, work even better.\n",
