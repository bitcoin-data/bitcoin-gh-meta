Say it's 2 days plus one second: some nodes still have it and so the broadcast is not very effective... and your transaction still falls out of memory pools.\n\nThis all creates a window where an aggressively broadcasting double-spender could replace the transaction in memory pools.  \n\nObviously double-spend exclusion can't be counted on, and perhaps will someday be mooted by a more greedy miner policy,   but I think it would be unfortunate to weaken the exclusion as a side effect of this if it can be avoided.\n",
