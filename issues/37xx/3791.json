   "body" : "I am requesting a receive address, but I keep getting addresses that have been previously used. This may be facilitated by the fact I am using a wallet.dat that was previously used as a backup, but nevertheless, even so, this is not ideal and is misleading the user into thinking they will be using an unused address. I propose that bitcoin-qt could check that the address hasn't been previously used and keep looking until it finds an actually unused one.\n",
