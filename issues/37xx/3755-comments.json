It is only in testing or unstable, which are not recommended by debian except for debian developers. I personally used 1.49 which is debian 7 wen I filed this bug, and things worked. Requiring 1.55 would mean debian users need to compile boost from source, and the instructions would need say that instead.\n",

On Windows there have been some critical issues (that I remember) with older boosts but in principle it should even still work with 1.37.\n\nSo: Boost 1.55 is suggested but not required. If you think this is a problem in the document, please fix it.\n\nPersonally I'm a bit tired of this, many people claim to 'fix' this then the next day it turns out that some other distribution wants something else. I suppose the only way to comprehensively document this is a table 'boost version per distribution version'.\n",
