      "body" : "Thanks for all your responses. I understand your opinion but perhaps I can share my perspective.\n\nI don't think it makes sense to talk about what \"everyone\" on the network thinks. Different participants in the network have different motivations, and we can therefore expect them to think differently.\n\nFor example I imagine that most regular users of bitcoin, running a wallet like Bitcoin-QT, would like the blockchain to be as small as possible, while still permitting them to send and receive bitcoins quickly and safely. Nonetheless they might be willing to live with a small amount of data inflation, if the result is a product which is significantly better for them. For argument's sake, let's say it allowed them to use bitcoin to pay their utility bills.\n\nOn the other hand I imagine that most miners don't care what transactions contain, so long as (a) there are as many transactions as possible, (b) they are paid well per transaction byte and (c) the price of bitcoin (in fiat terms) remains as high as possible. \n\nJust like there is no single entity which controls which transactions are confirmed, there is no single entity which controls which version of the bitcoin software should be run by the network. And since bitcoin is open source, there is always the risk of a fork in the software, which I think we can all agree would be fairly disastrous. In order to avoid this possibility, we must seek compromise between the interests of different participants, so that everyone is more-or-less happy enough to stay within the consensus.\n\nAnd so we come to the question of transaction metadata. Let's say miners love it and everyone else hates it. In that case, this idea of OP_RETURN + 40 (or 80) bytes seems like a reasonable compromise. It allows transactions to become a lot more valuable per byte (good for miners), but it doesn't impose too much of a storage cost on other participants. We still have the mechanism of transaction fees to ensure that people making use of the compromise have to pay their way in the market.\n\nCompared to this compromise approach, I don't see the sense in trying to dictate to the network what it should think and how it should behave. In any event the network's participants have the freedom to go in whichever direction they choose.\n",

Under your thinking, no significant changes are permitted to the bitcoin software, unless they are agreed upon by every single current participant in the bitcoin network. Nothing illogical about that, but it seems to me like an ultra-conservative position that will hobble the network's development.\n",
