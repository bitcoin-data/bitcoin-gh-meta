However, it's still possible, although unlikely, that the block might itself get rejected, so for the first few confirmations we say the transaction is 'confirming'.

      "body" : "I tried to reason about this risk analysis a while back and ran into the problem that the expected return of such an attack is related to the number of things you can concurrently attack in a block. The result is that you can't simply say \"This 10 BTC transaction isn't at risk because it's much smaller than the expected cost of the attack.\" because that could just be one transaction parallel attack against dozens of services amounting to thousands of Bitcoin.\n\nOn a related subject, our metric for confirmed really shouldn't be \"number of confirmations\" but the marginal height advantage over the next best chain which does not include the transaction, with some modification if blocks are really slow (e.g. isolation attack). But thats hideously complicated to implement. After headers-first it may be possible to implement advantage-over-next-best-chain without the doesn't-include constraint without much work. I dunno, the whole subject of risk analysis is a horrible rat-hole and I'm afraid solid advice will have poor patient-concordance.\n\nAttacks are rare and the cost of being immune to attacks hits you with every transaction. Maybe some of the answer here is simply insurance rather than transacting safely.\n",
