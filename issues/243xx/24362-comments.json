Additionally, users can take steps to keep from leaking information in a later transaction, e.g migrate the legacy UTXO to a newer output type (which on-chain would look like the UTXO was being spent to a bech32), before mixing it with other UTXOs to fund later transactions.\r\n\r\n> I am actually thinking right now that recipient output type matching could be a lot more beneficial, if we preferentially built input sets for coin selection from a single type of UTXOs. The resulting input sets would probably also be more waste-effective than mixed input sets, as e.g. legacy input sets would be preferred at low feerates and more modern output types should be more attractive at higher feerates than mixed sets of the same input count.\r\n\r\nThis is the ideal scenario! We keep output matching for all types to preserve privacy _and_ we have coin selection avoid mixing different output types when selecting inputs and always prefer to get rid of older output types when possible.\r\n\r\nI've been working on this in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24584 and would love feedback on the approach. This is better than not matching legacy addresses as it keeps the privacy improvements for all address types while also addressing concerns about later leaking information and concerns about creating new legacy UTXO's.\r\n\r\nConcept -0 on not matching change outputs for legacy, in favor of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24584",

      "body" : "I've been thinking more about the proposed change here. I would argue that before #24584, matching output types mostly improved privacy temporarily for the time between a transaction was created and the change output was spent, as the circumstances in which the change was later spent would more often reveal that it was the change, e.g. when it got spent together with more modern outputs which would indicate that the other output probably was the cause for using legacy outputs. There might have been more of a benefit if the change was a solitary input on the next transaction. However, especially given that there are many other heuristics that also hint at the change output, it seemed a bit unreasonable to increase the future cost of spending the change output by a factor 2.17Ã for this tenuous privacy benefit.\r\n\r\nAfter #24584 our wallets are presumably achieving single-type input sets for most transactions, and this actually changes the benefit of matching legacy outputs more to a question of âprivacy vs costâ. Although other heuristics that allow recognizing change would still not be impacted (e.g. based on amounts, or general wallet fingerprints matching between original and change transaction but not recipient transaction), but at least the legacy output is less likely to be mixed in with other outputs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is also a meta question of whether creating more legacy outputs helps sustain the acceptability of legacy use. Fewer legacy outputs on the network in general would also make matching legacy and then later spending legacy stick out more. Right now feerates are extremely low, so maybe the additional cost is currently worth the privacy benefit, but if the feerates go up significantly again, sitting on more legacy outputs would be more costlyâalthough they should get selected quickly at the current low feerates as well. And potential higher feerates in the future would prompt more people to switch to blockweight-efficient output types to lower their own future cost, which would reduce our creation of legacy outputs in turn then.\r\n\r\nSo, perhaps we don't need to get active at this time and remove matching of legacy outputs now. Most of the downsides will fix themselves in the long run anyway, and at current feerates the cost is likely low anyway.\r\n\r\nI.e. code looks good to me, I could see the argument go either way for various reasons.",

The user is sending Bitcoin to an address given to them by the recipient - they have no control over that address type. However the user may want to use segwit or taproot because those types are cheaper when spending. In a scenario where the user is trying to optimize for least fees (which many users do), it is actually not okay to send to change to legacy because that will incur higher fees in the future.\r\n\r\n> This affects privacy and makes no sense.\r\n\r\nPrivacy is not the end all be all of wallet design. Bitcoin Core's wallet is not a privacy focused wallet - we do not advertise as being private nor is privacy the primary focus. We try to encourage privacy and implement privacy improving behavior, but not to the detriment of other factors, such as cost to the user and effect on all the other nodes in the network. Given that legacy address types cost more to the user, cost more in block space, and can cost more to validate (in terms of CPU time), I think it is better for us to avoid making legacy outputs as much as possible, and that would include the contents of this PR. While it does have a negative impact on privacy, I do not think that the privacy gained from this behavior outweights the effects that continued legacy use has on everyone else.\r\n\r\nA potential alternative is to add an option that enables strict change type matching. Instead of removing this behavior entirely, it can be put behind a startup option or a transaction creation option so that users who do want the additional privacy can choose to enable it.",

It all depends on users and reviewers.\r\n\r\n> Given that legacy address types cost more to the user, cost more in block space, and can cost more to validate (in terms of CPU time), I think it is better for us to avoid making legacy outputs as much as possible, and that would include the contents of this PR.\r\n\r\nUsers can decide if they want to use legacy or other addresses in that case if they have a choice. \r\n\r\n> While it does have a negative impact on privacy, I do not think that the privacy gained from this behavior outweights the effects that continued legacy use has on everyone else.\r\n\r\nPrivacy is either by default or nothing.

And potential higher feerates in the future would prompt more people to switch to blockweight-efficient output types to lower their own future cost, which would reduce our creation of legacy outputs in turn then.\r\n> \r\n> So, perhaps we don't need to get active at this time and remove matching of legacy outputs now. Most of the downsides will fix themselves in the long run anyway, and at current feerates the cost is likely low anyway.\r\n\r\nThis sums up my feelings on this. I'd add that high feerates is a future problem, whereas privacy is a current problem. Not saying that we shouldn't be optimizing for fees now, but rather saying that I'd prefer we improve privacy today with slight tradeoffs in efficiency vs solutions that improve efficiency today at the expensive of privacy.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth mentioning that there are often ways to intervene with inefficient UTXOs (e.g migrating legacy UTXOs to newer types manually in low fee periods, improved coin-selection algos that are fee and address type aware, etc), whereas damaging privacy on-chain is a permanent mistake.\r\n",

I would request that you provide evidence for the tradeoff being worth it rather than just repeatedly demanding the best possible privacy at any costâthe former would be a contribution to the conversation, the latter lacks nuance and becomes just noise.\r\n\r\n1. I am not demanding anything. I am disagreeing with the changes in this pull request as a reviewer and responding to comments.\r\n\r\n2. If we all agree there is a privacy benefit in not merging this pull request there is no point in speculating about future fees and fingerprints. If change address could be identified using other things, we should try to fix them if possible and not make things worse. If they really affect privacy then #23789 #24584 are useless and should never have been merged.\r\n\r\n> Also, if you don't mind, which other wallets match Bitcoin Core's fingerprints?\r\n\r\nBluewallet: Version 2, Locktime 0\r\nBlockstream Green: Version 2, Locktime 0\r\nHexa: Version 2, Locktime 0\r\n\r\nI am sure there might be more wallets that use same version and locktime. Some wallets also match the fingerprint partially because either locktime or version matches. Wallets that use Bitcoin Core RPC which I had also mentioned in earlier comments would most probably have the same fingerprint. Transactions could even be sent to other bitcoin core user. \r\n\r\n-- -\r\n\r\nI am working as developer for an exchange and we will be using bitcoin core wallets so it can be added to the list of exchanges that use same fingerprint.",

      "body" : "#23789 and #24584 clearly were privacy improvements. While the former traded that off for additional cost, the latter actually seems to result both in a privacy improvement and a cost reduction. I agree with you that we should continue to work on removing privacy leaks. If you're looking for a project that is 100% focused on privacy, you will continue to be disappointed.\r\n\r\nBeyond that I think it's fair I explain myself to you before going back to mostly ignoring you:\r\nI get that you consider privacy the utmost priority. It's a valid point-of-view, and valuable for the project someone take that position. However, Bitcoin Core has a heterogeneous user base. While you care deeply for privacy, other users might care more about other things, e.g. usability or fees. Our decision should consider all of our users' needs, not just yours, and must be achievable within the available resources we an muster: we must consider security, reliability, privacy, cost, feasibility, maintainability, usability, relatability, and current network circumstances, etc.â¦\r\n\r\nWhile you appear to gladly suffer any sort of discomfort, costs, and overabundance of configuration options (which need to be developed, maintained, documented, and may be confusing to users) for better privacy, another user might be surprised and annoyed to pay more than twice the fees and never even consider changing defaults. While the additional cost is easy to denominate, the privacy reduction is not a binary all-or-nothing as you make it out to be, but depends on its actual real-world effect in context of the transaction's publication. Privacy is inherently contextual to the corresponding UTXO pool, the involved parties, the unique transaction history they appear in as well as what everyone else is doing on the network and the threat-model you're considering.\r\n\r\nAs someone that does care above average about privacy (and has contributed to a number of privacy improvements over the years), but does not hold the \"privacy-at-any-cost\" position, frankly, I consider your constant barrage of âcontributionsâ to the mailing list, issues and PRs a disservice to our goals. By intransigently taking the fundamental position âprivacy-over-everythingâ and _piss-poorly arguing for it_, you're undermining more nuanced discussions on the topics you care most about and inject noise that hampers progress. Perhaps you should consider whether your actions actually further your goals or whether you're doing more harm than good.",

I will continue to post things I understand and can help bitcoin. Others are free to do it in other topics.\r\n\r\nThis pull request doesn't involve payjoin, coinjoin etc. and is related to a basic privacy associated with any UTXO model chain. Revealing change address to save a few dollars should never be a default in a project like bitcoin core. If users are okay with it, why not create the options suggested in previous comment?\r\n\r\nIn future there could be requests to only match taproot address by accusing others of being too privacy focused or their contributions or privacy works better with only taproot address. We should try to make it difficult that change address is not revealed and not create opportunities. There are better ways to deal with fees vs privacy options.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCalling other opinion as \"noise\" and their contributions as \"barrage\" won't help",
