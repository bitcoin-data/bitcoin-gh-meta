Just to get ride of the honesty concept in matters of mempool acceptance. I believe it's accurate to talk about dishonesty only in the context of specific second-layer attacks. Because for some (e.g LN), the \"dishonest\"/attacker package confirming might be a good outcome for funds safety, namely pushing forward the channel state.\r\n\r\nI've clarified the doc to indicate that we just don't want the same-txid-different-witness transaction to be rejected completely, because we normally would consider it a conflict that we won't replace. I only want to document what the current code does, and it doesn't care about the fees of witnesses right now. We can change it later if the code changes.",
