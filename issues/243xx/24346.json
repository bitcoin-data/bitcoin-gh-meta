   "body" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIn Qubes OS, the \"Split-GPG\" feature allows keeping the private key in a separate VM from the application (in this case guix-attest).  This prevents a compromised VM (in which Bitcoin Core was built) from stealing the private signing key.  Qubes provides a `qubes-gpg-client-wrapper` executable that has the same API as `gpg`.  Unfortunately, there is currently no way to make `guix-attest` use that executable instead of plain `gpg`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nSupport an optional environment variable in `guix-attest`, which allows specifying an arbitrary command name that replaces `gpg`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nI considered a command-line parameter, but it seems that environment variables are the convention in `guix-attest`.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI believe OpenTimestamps provides a wrapper with `gpg`'s API as well, so maybe this would also be helpful for facilitating OpenTimestamps with Guix.\r\n",
