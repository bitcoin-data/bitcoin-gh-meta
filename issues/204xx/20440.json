   "body" : "Potential alternative to #20436. This is a patch, rather than changes being `echo`'d into the `src/gui/Makefile` post configure. It's also scoped to just darwin. Changes are based off `versiontagging_compiler` in corelib/global/global.pri.\r\n\r\nFrom #20436:\r\n> I suspect @fanquake will hate the fact that we're echoing into a generated file. This would be much cleaner if done at the qmake level\r\n\r\nI guess this is at the `qmake` level, but still feels like a bit of a hack. If we decide to go this way will add Carl/Cory as co-authors.",
