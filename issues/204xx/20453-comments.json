      "body" : "I could not replicate the issue in either the first or second comments here using Signet on Ubuntu 22.04. I created a wallet with one labelled address which I sent 0.001 to, before restarting with `txindex=1` and `-reindex`. After this was complete I checked `getbalance` which did indeed return the correct balance. I created a second labelled address and sent part of the balance there. `getbalance` also showed the correct balance after this as well as `listreceivedbyaddress`.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether @cryptoqube777 had set `-spendzeroconfchange` or another config flag which might affect the output of `getbalance` if they were making transactions?\r\n\r\nGiven that nobody else has reported the same issue in 2 years and it does not seem to be reproducible using the steps provided, perhaps this can be closed?",
