      "body" : "I recently looked into this because I was worried about the default (passing no options) still using size accounting and this being potentially slow after segwit activates.  I tried to estimate how slow this might be by setting a blockmaxsize=950000 and blockmaxweight=4000000 which should cause the mining algorithm to have to trace each package adding up size all the way through the mempool.  I found that this was only slightly slower than just setting blockmaxweight.  12ms average vs 10.5ms.\n\nI believe we should not do any extra work to support size accounting at this point, but that it is fine to leave it in the code and not a significant performance concern until we can all agree that there is no reason to keep the extra complication around.\n",
