   "body" : "Alternate to #8354/#8359.  Intended for 0.13.0.\n\nAs @laanwj observed, this is somewhat of a tedious change to make, but I do think that it'd be better to make this change now than live with the confusing \"cost\" terminology indefinitely into the future.\n\nIf we go with this, we should re-open https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/420 and make the corresponding change to the BIP.\n\nI didn't change qt/bitcoinstrings.cpp, which -- if I am understanding correctly -- was just changed so that we wouldn't translate the help language for `-blockmaxcost`.  Should I push a commit to this PR that changes the text there as well to refer to \"weight\", to make this change self-contained?\n\nThere's one more language reconciliation we should still do after this, which is that BIP 141 doesn't define \"sigop cost\", yet we refer to \"sigop cost\" as a term both in RPC calls (eg getblocktemplate) and throughout the code (comments, variables, function names, etc).  I think it'd be best to pick a term, use that in the BIP, and then make a pass through the code to be compatible -- presumably the simplest thing would be to just define \"sigop cost\" in BIP 141.\n",
