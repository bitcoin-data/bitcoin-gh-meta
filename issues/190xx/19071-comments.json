I was lead maintainer in a team of four maintainers of a popular open source database search engine from 2013-2016. About a year after I decided to move on, it was decided to do something similar to this proposal for a part of the project. Some time was spent to separate it. After that, the split-off part of the codebase saw much less attention and love. Its contributors and maintainers lost motivation. Two years after the split-off, it was decided to reintegrate it back into the project as before. Dev time and resources went into these transitions. /fin",

Therefore we should always question how much actual source code changes are worth implementing to bypass a communication platform issue (not saying this PR does that).\r\n\r\n* Unsure if the described mono-tree approach brings a relief in communication. Things like `For global refactoring or other global changes that touche GUI code, as well as\r\n non-GUI code, the main repository should be used.` makes it even more complex where to do what and how to change it if a PR suddenly needs to touch Core code.\r\n\r\n* Also unsure if the good experience we made with domain specific experts working on libsecp256k1 would also happen with the GUI. Libsecp256k1 is useful for a lot of projects (1:n) where the Bitcoin-Core-GUI would only have a specific use case (1:1). Testing the GUI and working on the GUI needs good insights into the Core repository as well (not the case for libsecp256k1).\r\n\r\n\r\nSplitting of the GUI code and communication is probably undoubtable a great long term achievement. I just think we first need better isolation/seperation for the GUI. A feasible \"API contract\" how the GUI can asynchronously work with the Core part in a separate process is IMO a precondition to split the GUI into a separate repository. Otherwise I see the risk of actually increase the complexity and work-load on both sides.",

      "body" : "> One issue could arise when arbitrary version-combinations are allowed.\r\n\r\nWhy would the split out GUI require versioning? It's still tightly coupled (build system, dependencies, qt version, minimum requirements wise etc) to the main repo, and the GUI repo would have no scope to change anything significant in that regard. Or do you mean this would be an issue if the GUI actually was to become an entirely separate project?\r\n\r\n> Review activity might decrease?\r\n> Review activity might increase?\r\n\r\nMy guess is decrease. The libsecp256k1 repo is very different. It's critical infrastructure, has contributors that are active across it, bitcoin/bitcoin, and many other projects, and there's far less scope for the type of bike-shedding/personal opinion (my distro does X!) type discussion that would undoubtedly occur in a GUI only-repo. I'd assume that while some of the reviewers that may have worked on GUI PRs, may also head to the alt repo, most may just stay and migrate to different parts of the codebase.\r\n\r\n> A smaller step is easier to undo when it turns out to come with any unforeseen downsides.\r\n\r\nDo you mean a small step change to the GUI? If we're going to have to start reverting GUI merges because not enough people looked at the other repo before something was merged here, that would not be an improvement to the workflow of this repository or the project in general.\r\n\r\n> The organizational side. There are 72 open issues (~14%) and 61 open PRs (~16%)\r\n\r\n> Looking at the last 15 or so gui related pull requests, the only one that was not gui-only was one pull request involving cs_main (#19011). For that reason it needed to also touch the node interface code.\r\n\r\nLooking at the open GUI tagged PRs: #18927, #18542, #18165, #18027, #17993, #17227, #16883, #16549 are some that touch areas outside the GUI.\r\n\r\n> Long-term: Think how long the grace period is for existing GUI related issues and pull requests. Issues can be transferred with a script after a grace period of some months?\r\n\r\nI don't think we want a long grace period.  Otherwise we're just living in the worst of both worlds. It also means a longer time for cross-referencing (in issues) to build up between the two repos, and discussions to be(come) fragmented.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoving the GUI out of this repo is something I've thought about for quite some time, so Concept ACK, even though as mentioned, this would just be a partial step in (hopefully) the right direction.\r\n\r\nHonestly I think it's unlikely that I would want to follow the new GUI repo issue/PR discussion (i.e fully subscribed as I am here), or review and merge changes from it. Although that's probably a little dependent on what they end up looking like.",

Thus, the proposed solution explicitly does *not* change the decision making process and the maintainers from the status quo.\r\n\r\n> I don't think we want a long grace period. Otherwise we're just living in the worst of both worlds. It also means a longer time for cross-referencing (in issues) to build up between the two repos, and discussions to be(come) fragmented.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, the grace period would only affect \"grandfathered\" pull requests, not new ones. I would feel uncomfortable closing all gui related pull requests in this repo over night (even the ones that are almost ready for merge). I think we should give each pull request that has already been filed against this repo a chance to make progess and get finalized (merged or closed) before transferring  it to the new repo. Otherwise it will be the exact outcome that you try to avoid.

Primarily for the GUI, but other tools could also use them. So this interface pull request should be handled in bitcoin/bitcoin, I think.\r\n* #18542 here as well, the only \"non-gui\" change is interface related. Maybe we could extend the rule from \"gui-only means src/qt\" to include changes in the interfaces folder, but I'll leave that up for discussion.\r\n* #18165 is a \"global refactoring\" affecting GUI and RPC code. The goal of this pull is to share pure utility methods between both components. This pull would be correctly filed against bitcoin/bitcoin.\r\n* #18027 The non-gui changes (psbt and wallet changes that affect rpc) should be split out. This is already the policy today, unless I am mistaken?\r\n* #17993 Only interface changes. See #18542 above.\r\n* #17227, #16883 At the very least the build system changes are not strictly GUI related and should stay in this repo.\r\n* #16549 The non-gui changes (psbt and wallet changes that affect rpc) should be split out.
