   "body" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCountless users have encountered the \"stuck transaction\" problem when the transactions piles up in the mempool, so that transactions with lower fees have to wait.\r\n\r\nThere's even a wiki page about this problem: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Fee_bumping#I_sent_the_stuck_transaction\r\nHowever, only knowledged/experienced users are able to follow such guidance. What's more, it's obviously an annoying hassle, which also makes the user prone to human errors, like overpaying with different (non-conflicting) UTXOs.\r\n\r\nThe rule that \"only 0-conf transactions with BIP125-enabled are allowed to be replaced (double-spent)\" is not really enforcable, so that it's actually a situation that everyone (especially the wallet GUI) just pretends to respect such a rule, which only blocks legitimate fee-bumping attempts by non-tech-savvy users.\r\n\r\nSuch \"rule\" also has a expiration time actually - the mempool expiration time of full nodes in the Bitcoin P2P network, like Bitcoin Core nodes.\r\n\r\n**Edit: The mempool expiration time doesn't mean the transaction itself has a expiration time - that's probably the most tricky part of this problem.**\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAllow Replace-By-Fee for transactions being stuck longer than mempool expiration time.\r\n\r\nThere are also corner cases (like lack of change output), which requires adding new inputs to the transaction - otherwise the user would probably have to do riskier things like replacing (removing, essentially) existing inputs or potentially immoral things like underpaying or even retracting the payment entirely, by double-spending.\r\n\r\n (To my understanding, there could be potential problems or risks like overpaying, if the wallet is allowed to remove existing input)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nChild-Pay-For-Parents (CPFP), which also requires change output.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_expiration\r\n\r\nMining pools also have been providing transaction prioritising services (the so-called \"transaction accelerator\") years ago, like https://www.pushtx.com/ and https://pushtx.btc.com/",
