Or alternately is it possible to find out from gdb if 0x7b6400004cc8 and  0x56527c390c60 correspond to symbols?\r\n\r\nM134059 seems like it is the cs_wallets mutex since it is locked in wallet.cpp:4004\r\n\r\nM133094 could be anything because second stack trace is useless and just shows some lock being acquired in some HandleLoadWallet callback. The HandleLoadWallet callback in the test is mining a new block, so maybe the mutex in question is cs_main or mempool.cs. But I don't see a case where cs_wallets would ever be locked while holding cs_main or cs_mempool. I do see cs_wallets is locked while holding cs_wallet in CreateWalletFromFile. So maybe M133094 is cs_wallet? cs_wallet is temporarily unlocked in HandleLoadWallet so I guess that technically could cause a deadlock if some other future nonexistent thread was added.\r\n\r\nI guess feedback would here would be that I don't think tsan is doing anything useful for this test and should probably be suppressed. Also it would be good if it could display less confusing mutex names.",

I think it strongly suggests the log mutex is involved, because it isn't annotated and this test relies a lot on log hooks. I think BDB probably isn't involved because there aren't really cases where BDB code would be calling back into our code while holding a mutex. \r\n\r\nI think I might not be too concerned about debugging this issue right now because #15719 rewrites a lot the test and related code.

In a unit test, if the mutexes  are per-test instance (not global variables), then there can't be a deadlock unless the test itself is written to have two or more of these threads running at the same time with the same mutexes. TSAN will complain, but there will not be any possibility of a deadlock if the test isn't creating multiple threads internally.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the `cs_wallet` mutex is unique to the test instance, and the other `cs_wallets` mutex is currently global, but #19101 updates it to be per-test instance.\r\n\r\n> `--with-sanitizers=thread` was introduced without `-g` and without `--with-debug` in [89bf196](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/89bf196c88e550fd066d6d44aa05ef88cd53b487). `-O2` could also screw up backtrace reports (inlining some functions and reorganizing the code, so that line numbers do not correspond to source code).\r\n\r\nThanks for finding that. To be sure, this only explains why the test is built without the other debug options, and there should be no problem adding `-g`? In any case I'll experiment with adding `-g` in the setup you pointed to and see if it helps makes TSAN output more readable.",
