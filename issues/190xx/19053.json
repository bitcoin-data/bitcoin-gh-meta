   "body" : "This PR is inspired by a [recent code review comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19010#discussion_r426954791) on a PR that introduced new functions to the net_processing module. The point of the discussion was basically that whenever we pass something not by value (in the concrete example it was about `CNode*` and `CConnman*`) we should either use\r\n* a pointer (```CType*```) with null pointer check or\r\n* a reference (```CType&```)\r\n\r\nTo keep things simple, this PR for a first approach\r\n* only tackles `CNode*` pointers\r\n* only within the net_processing module, i.e. no changes that would need adaption in other modules\r\n* keeps the names of the variables as they are\r\n\r\nI'm aware that PRs like this are kind of a PITA to review, but I think the code quality would increase if we get rid of pointers without nullptr check -- bloating up the code by adding all the missing checks would be the worse alternative, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nPossible follow-up PRs, in case this is received well:\r\n* replace CNode pointers by references for net module\r\n* replace CConnman pointers by references for net_processing module\r\n* ...",
