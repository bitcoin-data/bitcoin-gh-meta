   "body" : "I found it is very difficult to maintain privacy on my transactions because it is difficult to keep the address separated. I'm trying to prevent my addresses to cluster together, based on the following definition:\r\n\r\n> Usually an adversary will try to link together multiple addresses which they believe belong to the same wallet. Such address collections are called \"clusters\", \"closures\" or \"wallet clusters\", and the activity of creating them is called \"wallet clustering\". ([source](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy#Blockchain_attacks_on_privacy))\r\n\r\nWhile the coin control feature helps with that, it does not show all the transaction tree, listing just the coin sources.\r\n\r\nI would like the coin control window display all the clustered addresses belonging to any given tree so I can chose better which coins to use.\r\n\r\n### An example tree ###\r\n\r\nGiven the following transaction tree (where up-case letters are owned addresses)\r\n\r\n```\r\na -> B\r\n  -> C -> e\r\n     |--> D\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two UTXOs that can be spend: `B` and `D`, both are change addresses, within the coin-control I can see that the coins were received from `a`, but there is no mention of `e`, and that could be actually quite important, if for example `e` does know my name. That would allow for example, prioritizing those UTXO to send more money to `e`.\r\n\r\nCould it be possible to add that information in the tree?",
