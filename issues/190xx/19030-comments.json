Few days back I was thinking even exchanges can start doing CPFP for unconfirmed transactions when users deposit BTC and deduct amount from account balance if available.\r\n\r\nExample: I withdraw 0.1 BTC from Bitmex to my Bitfinex deposit address. Bitmex does the withdrawal once in a day and it's not confirmed for hours. Maybe Bitifinex can do CPFP for this transaction.",
