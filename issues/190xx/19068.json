   "body" : "Implements #18128 (mostly). From discussion on that issue we've got 3 `ACK`s (to move from .dmg to .zip), 1 `~0` and 1 `NACK`. So I've opened this PR to give a better overview of what the changes might actually look like. \r\n\r\nGitian builds currently work, however I haven't tested the signer, and that likely needs some additional changes. As mentioned we can drop quite a few packages from depends. There's some commits here that can cleaned up, squashed or dropped.\r\n\r\nIf you're compiling macOS, `make appbundle` will (as before) build a dynamically linked `Bitcoin Core.app`. `make deploy` will still build a statically linked `dist/Bitcoin Core.app` and will now also create a `dist/Bitcoin-Core.zip`.\r\n\r\nCompiling on Linux there has never been a `make appbundle` rule, and with these changes, `make deploy` now behaves the same as on macOS. The `make deploydir` rule has  been removed. \r\n\r\nInitially I  was unconvinced (of a swap from .dmg to .zip), however I have come around after looking at these changes. If there is not agreement that \"this is the way\", then I'll revive #18151 and fix it up to include `xorriso` in depends etc.",
