Though, I'm currently unsure if this slightly worsens the UX for macOS users. If it does, should we reduce the UX to simplify the build-system (is that an acceptable tradeoff)?\r\n\r\nHowever, if there is a difference in user experience between a zip and a dmg, it is probably marginal.",

There is a section on distribution outside the App Store: https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev033e997ca, however I couldn't quickly find any mention of using `.dmg`s.

The Bitcoin Core GUI is mostly [designed for power users of bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17395#issuecomment-550339984), and I think the intersection of power users, and people who don't know how to handle a `.zip` file would be very small. \r\n\r\nAlso, as far as I'm aware, you can open and use an app bundle from any directory on macOS, and it makes  little to no difference to how the app actually runs?",

We have a good reason to avoid that, namely to make deterministic builds easier. Even as an experienced macOS user, I find the symlink useful; it saves me from opening a new Finder window, navigating to Applications and then dragging between two windows. And it's a trivial thing to add.\r\n\r\n> Also, as far as I'm aware, you can open and use an app bundle from any directory on macOS, and it makes little to no difference to how the app actually runs?\r\n\r\nWhenever I deal with applications that don't have an installer or a symlink, I very often make the mistake of running it from the Download folder. That works, until I accidentally clean up the download folder. There's no obvious alternative folder to drag the program to.\r\n\r\nWhen downloading an upgrade there's an additional risk that a user doesn't replace the original version. The first time they might double click on the download and run the new version. Second time they might use command + space and launch the old version.",
