(code -14)`\r\n\r\nthe problem is, in the qt-console and bitcoin-cli, `walletpassphrase` command still works, while `walletpassphrasechange` doesn't work.\r\n\r\nI tried to change passphrase in bitcoin-qt 'setting' menu, it prompt the same error message.\r\n\r\nI failed to reproduce a wallet with the same issue, but I tried to load my wallet with this problem in bitcoin-core v0.19.0.1 / v0.19.1, both version with the same issue. I also try to enclosemy passphrase with qhotation marks,  still doesn't work. \r\n\r\nMaybe this is a bug?\r\n",
