I've meant that it would be interesting to see if an optimization that uses EA to mutate & crossover is actually an improvement over just random draws. To make the comparison fair, the EA and random draws should do the same number of fitness evaluations. If the EA optimizes with 10000 evaluations to find the best individual, a fair comparison would be with an algorithm that simply randomly choose 10000 individuals to find the best. If EA performs consistently better, then this is a sign that the crossover & mutation actually is a benefit. If just randomly picking individuals perform better this is a sign that the crossover & mutation does not really work well to explore the fitness space. It could go both ways.",

So, I changed the approach. Considering X generations, until the generation X/2, I don't apply mutation, I create the new individuals randomly, after that, considering 5 individuals for my population, I do:\r\n1 individual with the same chromosome from the best individual of previous generation\r\n1 individual from mutation (as I've done)\r\n2 random individuals with more or less* genes that the best individual of previous generations\r\n\r\n* if the fee rate is lower than the long term fee rate, I create 1 individual 40% bigger and 1 individual 20% bigger. Else, I create 2 individuals but smallers (40% and 20%).",

      "body" : "This is pretty cool, I'm curious whether it can be tweaked to find more interesting solutions than random draws.\r\n\r\nI would imagine that a smaller mutation rate and a larger population would be helpful, but I'm not sure that the genes are sufficiently decoupled for the algorithm to actually converge on a better solution. E.g. with an EA for a robot searching a labyrinth, the genes would indicate how the robot acts when seeing a specific surrounding, and learning better reactions for different situations contributing to an overall greater fitness. I don't see how just flipping half the UTXO could converge on a better input set, especially for larger UTXO pools (say 100+).\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be more interesting to compose new descendants from the UTXOs picked in the fittest and runner-up solution. Let's say the best solution A is composed of the three UTXOs {A1, A2, A3} and the second best solution B has the four UTXOs {B1, B2, B3, B4}. The UTXOs in each solution are sorted by value. The next generation would reuse A, and a few descendants generated by flipping a coin on whether to use A1 or B1, A2 or B2, A3 or B3, nothing or B4, with a small chance (5%?) of taking neither or both resulting e.g. in {A1, A2, B3} and {A1, B2, A3, B3}. Or perhaps by taking the start of A and the end of B and vice versa. Then maybe generate two more such descendants from the second and third best. Cull and redo any solutions that don't have enough funds in the first place. Rather than flipping each UTXO with a 50% chance, maybe have a small chance that a UTXO is dropped, gets replaced by a random different one, or a previously unselected UTXO is randomly added.\r\n\r\n5 seems very small for the population. Perhaps a bigger population would make fitter individuals stand out more quickly. Maybe try something like 20 or 30?",

      "body" : "@Xekyo Thanks, Murch! <br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n> I would imagine that a smaller mutation rate and a larger population would be helpful\r\n\r\nYeah, I'm gonna test with a smaller one, most algorithms use less than 1% for mutation rate. \r\n\r\n> Let's say the best solution A is composed of the three UTXOs {A1, A2, A3} and the second best solution B has the four UTXOs {B1, B2, B3, B4}. The UTXOs in each solution are sorted by value. The next generation would reuse A, and a few descendants generated by flipping a coin on whether to use A1 or B1, A2 or B2, A3 or B3, nothing or B4, with a small chance (5%?) of taking neither or both resulting e.g. in {A1, A2, B3} and {A1, B2, A3, B3}. Or perhaps by taking the start of A and the end of B and vice versa.\r\n\r\nInteresting. It would be a great crossover and mutation.\r\n\r\n> Then maybe generate two more such descendants from the second and third best\r\n\r\nI think it would be interesting if we increase the population. Considering 5 members, the second/third best solutions might be really bad, we shouldn't consider them to create decendents.. However, if we consider 20 or 30 members, I'm sure the second or third best solutions are decent and we can use them to create the new ones.\r\n\r\nIf the best solution A is {A1, A2, A3} and the second best solution B is {B1, B2, B3, B4}, we will first apply crossover, right? So,  I think we can flip a coin  to decide the genes (50% A/50% B), in this case, it would generate some ones like:\r\n\r\nA = {A1, A2, A3}\r\nB = {B1, B2, B3, B4}\r\npossible descendants:\r\nX = {A1, A2, B3}\r\nX = {A1, B2, B3}\r\nX = {A1, A2, A3, B4}\r\nX = {A1, B2, B3, B4}\r\n...\r\n\r\nAnd then, we can apply mutation, maybe we can do:\r\n```\r\nfor gene in genes:\r\n  random = getRandomValueBetween1And1000()\r\n  if random == 1:\r\n     //gets replaced by a random different one\r\n  elif random == 2:\r\n    //drop it\r\n\r\nrandom = getRandomValueBetween1And1000()\r\nif random > 1: \r\n  //push a new UTXO\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, it is just an example to show we can use what you suggested as mutation:\r\n> have a small chance that a UTXO is dropped, gets replaced by a random different one, or a previously unselected UTXO is randomly added.\r\n\r\nAbout the new generations, considering 20 members (A (the best one), B (second), C, D, E, F, G...) the decedents could be:\r\n1 - A\r\n2 - Crossover A/B + mutation\r\n3 - Crossover A/B + mutation\r\n4-  Crossover A/B + mutation\r\n5 - Crossover B/C + mutation\r\n6 - Crossover B/C + mutation\r\n7 - Crossover B/C + mutation\r\n8 - Crossover A/C + mutation\r\n9 - Crossover A/C + mutation\r\n10 - Crossover A/C + mutation\r\n...\r\nWhat do you think?",

I would suspect that they require a lot of computation and would be very slow, while I don't see why recombining different subsets of input selections would hone in on a better solution.\r\n\r\nI would second what @martinus said above. Before getting too much into the details on this, it would be good to substantiate that it even produces useful results, e.g. by showing that the input sets improve over time as the EA runs, and that it can beat e.g. the best out of multiple random selections.",

It is optimizing for things that I would not consider important (reducing dust events, which is already achieved with a minimum change) and is extremely inefficient in trying to attain them. The simulation results are implausible (apparently their average BnB result is 10^10 sats greater than the target), making me think that their scenarios are not representative for the task at hand or their re-implementation of Bitcoin Core's coin selection inaccurate.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that they are essentially replicating the behavior of BnB at high feerates, but do so by randomly generating the input sets instead of efficiently traversing the possible solution space, while only using a single output type and ignoring fees.",
