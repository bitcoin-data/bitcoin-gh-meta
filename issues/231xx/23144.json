   "body" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIf coin selection fails as part of `send` or `sendtoaddress`, the error message returned to the RPC client is `Insufficient funds`, even if the actual cause is due to `too-long-mempool-chain`.  This is likely to alarm users unnecessarily, as they will believe this means their funds have permanently vanished rather than being temporarily inaccessible.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIf coin selection fails due to `too-long-mempool-chain`, the `send` and `sendtoaddress` methods should pass that error back to the RPC client, instead of `Insufficient funds`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nIt would be even nicer from a UX standpoint if the limit on mempool chain length were removed, but AIUI [that's a DoS vector](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/9752#issuecomment-281464014), so is not going to happen.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nApparently this is [already done for `sendrawtransaction`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10015#issuecomment-288597075).  The discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10015 is relevant (it appears that the PR was withdrawn for reasons unrelated to my request).\r\n",
