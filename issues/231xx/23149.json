This shouldn't really have any effect on\r\nexisting builders, who were already using `--enable-werror`, and is more\r\ninline with what they would expect `--enable-werror` to be, which is\r\nerroring on any/all warnings.\r\n\r\nWe keep `-Wno-error=return-type` because we know that is broken when using\r\nmingw-w64. It should only be applied when cross-compiling for Windows.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the change in #20544, but with (hopefully) less work-arounds, \r\nand other bundled changes. A step towards some configure \"cleanups\".",
