   "body" : "The original CAddrMan behaviour (before #5941) was to pick a uniformly random non-empty bucket, and then pick a random element from that bucket. That commit, which introduced deterministic placement of entries in buckets, changed this to picking a uniformly random non-empty bucket position instead.\r\n\r\nI believe that was a mistake. Buckets are our best metric for spreading out requests across independently-controlled nodes. That\r\ndoes mean that if a bucket has fewer entries, its entries are supposed to be picked more frequently.\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts to the original high-level behavior, but on top of the deterministic placement logic.\r\n",
