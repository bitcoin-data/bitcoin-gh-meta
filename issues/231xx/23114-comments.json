To make sure that signed integer behavior matches actual integers, the language doesn't specify what happens when they overflow/underflow (in some cases, it's UB; in some cases it's implementation-defined behavior).\r\n\r\nThis is problematic: sometimes you actually _want_ the *mod 2<sup>N</sup>* behavior, and sometimes you're just operating on unsigned integers which you know will never overflow. IMHO, there should just be two distinct types for that in the language, but for whatever reasons, that's not the case in C/C++. The sanitizers cannot tell the difference either, so you have to tell it whether you want integers that act *mod 2<sup>N</sup>*, or whether you want unbounded unsigned integer-like behavior. Unfortunately, certain codebases, especially ones that include cryptographic code, have a mix of both. So the solution is either not enabling unsigned integer sanitizers at all (making it assume mod behavior for everything; the default), or enabling it and having suppressions for places where mod behavior is desired.\r\n\r\nSo to be clear: we explicitly enable unsigned integer sanitizers in Bitcoin Core, which causes it to trigger for things that are perfectly well-defined behavior (but potentially still red flags, if mod behavior is not desired). We could just not do that, but I guess there are large portions on the codebase where these red flags are interesting to see.",

Reviews and testing the library should (presumably) be posted on this PR.\r\n\r\nOnce this is (hopefully) merged that opens the door to a greater review focus on the [Erlay PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21515). It seems to me that that PR has been waiting on this to get to a final(ish) state.",
