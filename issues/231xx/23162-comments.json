Even having to render the image as a bitmap on the server side might be more DoS-risky.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I first used Pillow on the Python side, but it doesn't [currently support SVG](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/3509). so I worked around it by using ImageMagick to convert to a trivial image format (PPM) and loading that manually. If the image format was changed to something else we could use Pillow, instead. But I'm not really sure it's a more convenient dependency than ImageMagick.",

It has a bit more sophisticated facilities for that, if the captcha ever gets harder.\r\n\r\nThat's an interesting suggestion. It can also do dithering instead of a naive threshold, which might or might not help. I didn't initially want to rely on ImageMagick too much, in case the image format changes to something that Pillow can natively handle, but as it's not using that anymore, it doesn't seem bad to commit further to that direction.\r\n\r\nEdit: I tried adding `-monochrome` but this doesn't seem to make it better, if anything it gets slightly more noisy (see especially the \"e\").

The faucet could already return any kind of information in an error that is printed directly to the console (including control characters, any unicode and escape sequences). The captcha isn't worse in that sense. If you want to harden it you could do various things:\r\n\r\n- Sanitize any strings coming from the faucet.\r\n- Require the captcha to be in a specific image format (this is currently left open), by making the input `-:svg`. This is a compromise as it would limit flexibility to change image formats in the future.\r\n- Limit the size/complexity of the SVG, limit dimensionsâdon't know if ImageMagick has introspection into this before actually rendering the thing, you might need a sifferent SVG parser.\r\n\r\nYou're welcome to work on this but I see it as outside the scope of this pull request.",
