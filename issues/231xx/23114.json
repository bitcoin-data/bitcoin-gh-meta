   "body" : "This takes over #21859, which has [recently switched](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21859#issuecomment-921899200) to my integration branch. A few more build issues came up (and have been fixed) since, and after discussing with sipa it was decided I would open a PR to shepherd any final changes through. \r\n\r\n> This adds a `src/minisketch` subtree, taken from the master branch of https://github.com/sipa/minisketch, to prepare for Erlay implementation (see #21515). It gets configured for just supporting 32-bit fields (the only ones we're interested in in the context of Erlay), and some code on top is added:\r\n> * A very basic unit test (just to make sure compilation & running works; actual correctness checking is done through minisketch's own tests).\r\n> * A wrapper in `minisketchwrapper.{cpp,h}` that runs a benchmark to determine which field implementation to use.\r\n\r\nOnly changes since my last update to the branch in the previous PR have been rebasing on master and fixing an issue with a header in an introduced file.",
