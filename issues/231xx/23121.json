   "body" : "When RBF was originally implemented in #6871, the mempool did not keep track of ancestor scores yet. It was pointed out that ancestor scores would be the most accurate metric, and [suggested](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6871#discussion_r43031583) to temporarily \"Require that any new inputs that show up in the replacing transaction be already confirmed. In the future, if we do merge something like ancestor package tracking and better mining code, we could update this...\"\r\n\r\n#7594 added ancestor tracking to the mempool. It enables mempool validation and mining code to directly access a mempool entry's ancestor score (total modified fees divided by total vsize for the transaction and all of its mempool ancestors). As such, we now have the ability to do what was desired originally.\r\n\r\nThis PR does 2 things:\r\n\r\n(1) When evaluating a transaction for RBF, requires the replacement transaction to have a higher ancestor score than that of each original transaction. This boils down to \"the replacement transaction is a better candidate for mining (by feerate) than all of the transactions it would replace.\"\r\n\r\n(2) Removes enforcement of BIP125 Rule #2, allowing replacement transactions to spend unconfirmed inputs not spent by the original transactions.",
