But I would be reluctant to do that because the test goes out of its way to respect the [`QT_QPA_PLATFORM`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/35a31d5f7e9cd71a210c1ed10abc9d772ff36049/src/qt/test/test_main.cpp#L68-L75) when it is set, so it would be inconsistent for it to stop respecting `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME`.\r\n\r\nSetting these variables is not necessarily useful if you only care about CI pass/fail results, but it can be useful if you want to observe or record what happens during the tests visually. I think the ideal fix for this problem would be implemented upstream in Qt. It should probably be a nonfatal error instead of a fatal error if `QGuiApplicationPrivate::updatePalette()` can't connect to the gnome socket.",
