Seems to me upon connection peers should always tell each other what their best blocks are, even if they are at the same height.\n",

The problem is that if an inbound peer is multiple blocks ahead of you and you have other outbound peers, the download logic tries to download the intermediate blocks from one of the outbound peers.  If the outbound peers haven't announced the block, then you'll never request them.  \n\nThat's true even if an inbound peer continued to announce blocks that continue to build on its chain, you wouldn't ever advance your tip to catch up, because you'll be held up by not requesting the intermediate blocks, since you have no one to request them of.  \n",
