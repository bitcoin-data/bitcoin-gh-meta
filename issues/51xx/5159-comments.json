I think we should also change `txconfirmtarget` to default to 2 or higher for non QT usage.  1 is just dangerous given the fact that it's often impossible to be reliably confirmed in 1 transaction.    Separately, #4082 is a somewhat substantial problem though.   Is anyone working on the fixes @gavinandresen and @gmaxwell suggested?  I just want to be sure we tie all these changes together to work well.\n",

If that code ever gets moved out of main, I think it makes sense for those two checks on inputs to stay together.  However if you don't like that, I can revert back to putting the logic inside `CTxMemPoolEntry` and I'll just call the constructor with a reference to the mempool itself.  In both cases it now checks to be sure inputs aren't in the mempool as you suggest, as opposed to checking that they are in the chain as in my original version.  I renamed the variable and also fixed the portability issue I think.\n",

It's not always a matter of not having enough data, but sometimes there really is no answer to the question, because  there is no fee that is high enough that you'll reliably (> 85%) get confirmed within 1 block.  In any case, I was operating under the assumption that this wasn't making it in for 0.10, so I was planning on waiting for that and then rebasing.  I also have a couple small improvements to make.\n",

I'm not sure if you planned to squash that commit or leave it separate.\n\nSo to decouple BlockPolicyEstimator from txmempool.o you just need to also take AllowFreeThreshold and AllowFree with you, and separate CTxMemPoolEntry to a different file.\nAt that point, maybe something like policy/fees makes more sense than policy/estimator, we can put more fee-related stuff there later (like CFeeRate, once CTxOut gets decoupled from it).\n\nAlso, why couple CBlockPolicyEstimator to the minRelayTxFee global when it can take CTxMemPool::minRelayFee (which is only used to pass it to CBlockPolicyEstimator::Read which ends up not using it) ??\n\nYou have some good opportunities to reduce dependency on boost or at least not increase it (I'm talking about the foreach loops), but if you don't want to do it you can at least explicitly include the dependency in the new file.\n\nI have created a branch with my many suggestions in form of code:\n\nhttps://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commits/morcos_new-estimates\n\nThe last commit doesn't pass the tests because mempool.HasNoInputsOf(tx) is always called when creating a new entry: CTxMemPoolEntry::hadNoDependencies is never set to false by default.\nThe rest of the commits compile individually although some of them would increase your total diff to master more than others (some are \"free\" in that sense, like the file rename one) so it's up which one you include.\nFeel free to squash, edit, reword, kill or reorder the commits as you think it's best.\n",

      "body" : "@Diapolo Thanks for thinking about that.  I think it could certainly use some more testing.  There are two things in my mind that could use improving.\n1) I think the default txConfirmTarget should be greater than 1.  There are periods of time when 1 can be quite a high fee temporarily.  I plan to open this discussion in a different PR at some point, because its a bit of a separate discussion.  This doesn't really affect the GUI, though since that uses a default of 25.\n2) It's also possible at times to not have an answer for `estimatefee 1` but to have answer for all other estimates.  This is a feature not a bug, but I think it would be possible to design a better UI experience in that case.  Perhaps the slider bounces back to the first legitimate estimate, or gives you a helpful message such as \"No amount of fee will get you reliably confirmed in the next block\".\n",

The default `txConfirmTarget` could then be set to fractional values, e.g. 1.2, which would perhaps result in greater stability.\n",

After removing these transactions from the estimation, I've found that the relative frequency of high-fee transactions being included in the next block is pretty high and consistent, typically > 95%. \n",

      "body" : "@bitcoinfees, thanks for the comments.  I think asking for the mean number of blocks to confirmation is a slightly different question than I answered.  It's not clear if one question is better than another, but the way I defined the question is what fee would you need to have a sufficiently high percentage chance of getting confirmed in the desired number of blocks, so it kind of requires a MIN_SUCCESS_PCT.  But to your point, I do think that there could be a lot of improvements to this estimation algorithm, and hopefully they could build off the framework it provides.\n\nI agree with your conclusion on why the success percentage has a ceiling around 90%.  Hopefully with an improved transaction selection algorithm for mining in the future that will get better.\n",
