It's easily triggerable with Pieter's invalidate block patch.\n\nThe fix given here does not appear to be sufficient as pindexBestForkBase is also dereferenced in the next block below, so I cannot ACK.  I would bludgeon Matt to clean the whole thing up, but he's travling and a minimal change for 0.10 would be preferable.\n\n21E14, can you please extend the guards so that all the deferences in this function are protected? I think that would be the simple and conservative move right now rather than trying to reason about what invarients hold for these globals. Having potential crash bugs for a corner case nag message isn't something that excites me.\n",
