Both Functions/methods longer than X lines and Y nested levels of flow control raised warnings saying that the function couldn't possibly be readable and asking you to refactor it.\nAfter the change EvalScript() is 274 lines and has 4 nested levels of flow control at most, which I think it's complex enough.\n\nThe groupings were already there, this is just the simplest (more reviewable) way to split the switch maintaining most of the code and just passsing opcode to those cases that were already grouped.\nIn some cases like OpEqual(), I've replaced the opcode parameter for a simpler boolean param (fVerify to do the additional verification when the opcode is OP_EQUALVERIFY).\n\nMaybe later OpNumUnary(), OpNumBinary(), OpCrypto(), etc can be split further without replicating code (I doubt it), but in fact splitting them in the same commit actually seems more risky and less reviewable to me.\n\nEDIT: Anyway, the tests are failing in some platforms so I've must have done something wrong.\n",

Obviously functional changes and releases should never be delayed to make refactorings easier.\n\nNonetheless, early feedback is always greatly appreciated, thank you @theuni @laanwj @gavinandresen\n\nIf keeping it open for later is a distraction, I can close it now and reopen it after0.10, no problem.\n",
