Wait until it has\n+completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL\n+is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be\n+migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+- From Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no\n+longer supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance\n+when macOS \"dark mode\" is activated.\n+\n+Known Bugs\n+==========\n+\n+The process for generating the source code release (\"tarball\") has changed\n+in an\n+effort to make it more complete, however, there are a few regressions in\n+this release:\n+\n+- - The generated `configure` script is currently missing, and you will\n+need to\n+  install autotools and run `./autogen.sh` before you can run\n+  `./configure`. This is the same as when checking out from git.\n+\n+- - Instead of running `make` simply, you should instead run\n+  `BITCOIN_GENBUILD_NO_GIT=1 make`.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+Changes regarding misbehaving peers\n+- -----------------------------------\n+\n+Peers that misbehave (e.g. send us invalid blocks) are now referred to as\n+discouraged nodes in log output, as they're not (and weren't) strictly\n+banned:\n+incoming connections are still allowed from them, but they're preferred for\n+eviction.\n+\n+Furthermore, a few additional changes are introduced to how discouraged\n+addresses are treated:\n+\n+- - Discouraging an address does not time out automatically after 24 hours\n+  (or the `-bantime` setting). Depending on traffic from other peers,\n+  discouragement may time out at an indeterminate time.\n+\n+- - Discouragement is not persisted over restarts.\n+\n+- - There is no method to list discouraged addresses. They are not returned\n+by\n+  the `listbanned` RPC. That RPC also no longer reports the `ban_reason`\n+  field, as `\"manually added\"` is the only remaining option.\n+\n+- - Discouragement cannot be removed with the `setban remove` RPC command.\n+  If you need to remove a discouragement, you can remove all\n+discouragements by\n+  stop-starting your node.\n+\n+Notification changes\n+- --------------------\n+\n+`-walletnotify` notifications are now sent for wallet transactions that are\n+removed from the mempool because they conflict with a new block. These\n+notifications were sent previously before the v0.19 release, but had been\n+broken since that release (bug\n+[#18325](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18325)).\n+\n+PSBT changes\n+- ------------\n+\n+PSBTs will contain both the non-witness utxo and the witness utxo for segwit\n+inputs in order to restore compatibility with wallet software that are now\n+requiring the full previous transaction for segwit inputs. The witness utxo\n+is still provided to maintain compatibility with software which relied on\n+its\n+existence to determine whether an input was segwit.\n+\n+0.20.2 change log\n+=================\n+\n+### P2P protocol and network code\n+\n+- - #19620 Add txids with non-standard inputs to reject filter (sdaftuar)\n+- - #20146 Send post-verack handshake messages at most once (MarcoFalke)\n+\n+### Wallet\n+\n+- - #19740 Simplify and fix CWallet::SignTransaction (achow101)\n+\n+### RPC and other APIs\n+\n+- - #19836 Properly deserialize txs with witness before signing (MarcoFalke)\n+- - #20731 Add missing description of vout in getrawtransaction help text\n+(benthecarman)\n+\n+### Build system\n+\n+- - #20142 build: set minimum required Boost to 1.48.0 (fanquake)\n+- - #20298 use the new plistlib API (jonasschnelli)\n+- - #20880 gitian: Use custom MacOS code signing tool (achow101)\n+- - #22190 Use latest signapple commit (achow101)\n+\n+### Tests and QA\n+\n+- - #19839 Set appveyor vm version to previous Visual Studio 2019 release.\n+(sipsorcery)\n+- - #19842 Update the vcpkg checkout commit ID in appveyor config.\n+(sipsorcery)\n+- - #20562 Test that a fully signed tx given to signrawtx is unchanged\n+(achow101)\n+\n+### Miscellaneous\n+\n+- - #19192 Extract net permissions doc (MarcoFalke)\n+- - #19777 Correct description for getblockstats's txs field (shesek)\n+- - #20080 Strip any trailing / in -datadir and -blocksdir paths (hebasto)\n+- - #20082 fixes read buffer to use min rather than max (EthanHeilman)\n+- - #20141 Avoid the use of abs64 in timedata (sipa)\n+- - #20756 Add missing field (permissions) to the getpeerinfo help\n+(amitiuttarwar)\n+- - #20861 BIP 350: Implement Bech32m and use it for v1+ segwit addresses\n+(sipa)\n+- - #22124 Update translations after closing 0.20.x on Transifex (hebasto)\n+- - #21471 fix bech32_encode calls in gen_key_io_test_vectors.py (sipa)\n+- - #22837 mention bech32m/BIP350 in doc/descriptors.md (sipa)\n+\n+Credits\n+=======\n+\n+Thanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:\n+\n+- - Aaron Clauson",
