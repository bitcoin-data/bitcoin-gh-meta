   "body" : "This pull request is part of the `libbitcoinkernel` project https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24303 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/18 and more specifically its \"Step 2: Decouple most non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel\". dongcarl is the original author of this patchset, these commits were taken from https://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/tree/2022-03-libbitcoinkernel-chainparams-args-only. \r\n\r\n#### Context \r\n\r\nThe bitcoin kernel library currently relies on code containing user configurations through the `ArgsManager`. This is not optimal, since as a stand-alone library it should not rely on bitcoind's argument parsing logic. Instead, its interfaces should accept control and options structs that control the kernel library's desired configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar work towards decoupling the `ArgsManager` from the kernel has been done in \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25527 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25862.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\nBy moving the `CChainParams` class definition into the kernel and giving it new factory functions `CChainParams::{RegTest,SigNet,Main,TestNet}`it can be constructed without an `ArgsManager` reference, unlike the current factory function `CreateChainParams`.\r\n\r\nThe first few commits remove uses of `ArgsManager` within `CChainParams`. Then the `CChainParams` definition is moved to a new file in the `kernel/` subdirectory.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
