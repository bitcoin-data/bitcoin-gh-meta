   "body" : "Hi,\r\n\r\nI research on consensus and need a forced delay between submittability of new blocks.\r\nIn bitcoin you use stochastics + processor clock speed. This allows you to choose an expected forced delay, which you chose to be 10min.\r\n\r\nQuote from White Paper:\r\n\"To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.\"\r\n\r\nI do not see a way to find consensus on the present value of the moving average without yet implementing another consensus mechanism. But it appears necessary to have a very accurate global consensus on the exact value of the average because this value determines the mining difficulty. ***So how do you do it?*** Please give all the details in a novice-comprehensible way.\r\n",
