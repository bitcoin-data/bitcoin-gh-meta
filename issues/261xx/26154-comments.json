I was only pointing out that this kind of coding practice is confusing because the variable definition doesn't belong _only_ to the test.\r\n\r\n> While this isn't incorrect, it's not meaningfully helpful. It doesn't really add anything useful to the codebase. The code as it is now is not broken nor necessarily wrong either.\r\n\r\nI disagree.  As someone new to the code base trying to make heads or tails of what's going on is confusing.  To make it easier for others to contribute, I think I high level of code quality should be a priority.\r\n\r\n> PRs like this just end up being noise both in terms of open PRs, and i..\r\n\r\nWhile I don't disagree that this PR is very tiny and somewhat pedantic because it's a 1 line change.  To me the only argument that makes sense for not including changes like this is that it's tiny.  The reason I like tiny PRs is:\r\n\r\n1) that I'm still relatively new (especially in terms of time I have to contribute as a unpaid volunteer), so I'd rather start contributing small changes instead of giant ones.\r\n\r\n2)  [Contributing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) encourages not making super large PRs\r\n\r\n3) Tiny PRs like this in my mind should be reviewed and either closed or merged in a short period since it's trivial to review.  I'm surprised it's taken 6 months to even be looked at.   The time it's taken to get any feedback on a number of PR's I made 6 months ago has changed my focus away from core to other projects for now.\r\n\r\nSo, While I disagree that this PR isn't meaningful, I do agree it is tiny and as you say causes problems since it's such a small nit pick.  Do you have recommendations for how this might be included as a larger PR or grouped with other changes?  You're the expert on this area of the codebase and some meaningful feedback for how I can contribute meaningful changes would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke personally I'd preferred to have left this open until we could have more conversation about it.  It was open for 6 months with no feedback and then closed in 2  days without much meaningful dialog imo.",

I'm surprised it's taken 6 months to even be looked at.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a tiny PR like this one has taken 6 months for anyone to even look at it is why I think it is noise. There are over 300 other PRs to look at, with several large projects going on at the same time. People are busy looking at other things so trivial changes refactors such as this are being ignored because no one has the time to look at it. Since this PR does exist, it also means that people looking for things to review may spend a bit of time looking at this briefly or otherwise find it just a bit harder to find a PR that they do want to review since this will be in the PR lists. Those that do look at this will have spent their time on a trivial change when that time that could have been spent reviewing any of the other 300+ PRs. Even though the change is trivial (after reviewing it), it still needs to be reviewed and reviewers need to spend time on this instead of spending time on the other things that the project has collectively decided is useful and desired.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the time opportunity cost this incurs, it can also have an effect on other, more substantial, PRs. Although git does not detect a merge conflict here, it's possible that this results in a silent merge conflict with another PR. This would result in that PR having to be rebased, which then requires reviewers to re-review it, and delay its merging. This just wastes a bunch of time.\r\n\r\n> Do you have recommendations for how this might be included as a larger PR or grouped with other changes?\r\n\r\nThis could be grouped with anything that changes those particular test cases in a meaningful way.",

While this stylistic change makes sense on its own, it comes at a cost and risk for the project as a whole. The weak motivation for the change does not justify the burden that it places on the project. A burden could be any of the following:\r\n\r\n* Time spent on review\r\n* Accidental introduction of bugs\r\n* (Silent) merge conflicts, either in the branch or a backport branch. Those conflicts demand further developer and reviewer time or introduce bugs.\r\n\r\nFor more information about refactoring changes and stylistic cleanup, see\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#refactoring\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15465\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26621#issuecomment-1401077847\r\n\r\nGenerally, if the style is not mentioned nor enforced by the developer notes, we leave it up to the original author to pick whatever fits them best personally and then leave it that way until the line is touched for other reasons.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any questions.",
