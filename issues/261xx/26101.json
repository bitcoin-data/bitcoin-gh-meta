   "body" : "This is intended to be a safer way for functions to accept only a subset of sigversion values.\r\n\r\nIt's intended to solve the uninitialized value warning seen here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25972#issuecomment-1246632859\r\n\r\nNow that all possible values in the `enum class` are tested, there's no need for a default case and thus the compiler should be able to deduce that there's no way for this value to be used uninitialized.\r\n\r\nSadly it's not possible to do any type of inheritance with an `enum class`, so instead it's faked by using `std::underlying_type_t<SigVersion>`, which should ensure that it's in sync with `SigVersion` even if it changes in the future.\r\n\r\nImo this is safe enough that there's no need for a default case as suggested here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25972#issuecomment-1248193244 , but that's up for discussion here.\r\n\r\nThe second commit is simply a cleanup that removes the need to pass a sigversion to EvalChecksigTapscript because it's only intended to ever be used with... tapscript.",
