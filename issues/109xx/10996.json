   "body" : "Adds a per-net network.conf as per #9374 ; this is pretty much the same as #9402 which was closed for lack of interest.\r\n\r\nIt's somewhat interesting in the context of #10994 because it provides somewhere to stick the network-specific vbignore settings. Unless I'm missing something, I don't think #10267 provides an easy way of doing per-network config files, so wouldn't work well for that particular use case.\r\n\r\nThis patch doesn't include any tests, so is marked as WIP. There's some test code in #10267 that would presumably be able to be adapted pretty easily.",
