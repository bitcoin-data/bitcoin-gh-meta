If you dont need to rescan, you hopefully don't need to access them, and you cant run with -txindex with pruning, so rescan is about the only thing you could even do with them. It might be cool to create a bootstrap.dat over time as your node prunes blocks, but reindex isn't all that much faster than network sync, and hopefully we can continue to improve that anyway.",
