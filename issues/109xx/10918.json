It's possible unknown rules are in effect_\r\n\r\nThis warning (yellow warning line on the dashboard screen) remained, even after the amount of unexpected version blocks decreased to 13/100 blocks, see debug.log:\r\n\r\n`2017-07-24 16:23:37 UpdateTip: new best=0000000000000000013b4a70548846b8902da69791abcc8caaf3b808eba80930 height=477379 version=0x20000002 log2_work=86.817098 tx=241550958 date='2017-07-24 16:23:45' progress=1.000000 cache=100.7MiB(50832tx) warning='13 of last 100 blocks have unexpected version'`\r\n\r\nOnly after restarting bitcoind, the yellow alert line in the GUI did not appear again.\r\n\r\n### What I would suggest\r\nI would suggest that the warning message automatically disappears if the unknown version block count gets below a threshold which is some percentage lower than the activation threshold (to prevent state flapping), so no restart of bitcoind is needed to make the warning disappear.",
