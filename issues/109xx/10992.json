Furthermore, trying to close the progress bar window simply makes it disappear, and then shortly appear again. This behavior is clearly seen in the gif below.\r\n\r\n![peek 2017-08-05 01-39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3782274/28994277-09a101c2-797f-11e7-8b3c-2ed7d27a66c5.gif)\r\n\r\nRescanning also completely locks up the GUI and nothing else can be done.\r\n\r\nSince there is an `abortrescan` RPC command, there should be some way to abort a rescan now through the progress bar dialog that appears, either with an additional button, or by clicking the X to close it.",
