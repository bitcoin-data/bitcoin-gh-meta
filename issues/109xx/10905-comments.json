The only callsite is wallet.cpp:3664, where the variable is a local stack variable, so there is no thread-safety issue.\r\n\r\nThe `setAddress.clear();` line doesn't do anything meaningful either (the passed set is already empty). We could think about returning the result directly instead of passing it by reference to avoid the `clear()` and also to make it more clear that locking isn't needed there.\r\n\r\nEdit: a lock seems to be missing though from `crypter.h, GetKeys()`, but not for `setAddress.clear()`, but for looping through `mapCryptedKeys`.",
