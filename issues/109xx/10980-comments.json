This is long time ago so I might not remember all details...\r\n\r\nCurrently `externalhd2` works fine but generate the address as \"watch-only\".\r\nThe problem is that core consider an address \"IS_MINE\" only if you can sign. (which is not the case for addresses generated by `external hd`)\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless, the watchonly addresses generated by externalhd2 should be considered IS_MINE even if I can't sign. Because I want Core to behave exactly as if it was a normal wallet, except without it the ability to sign with the generated keys. (Another PR related to that that I had was separating IS_MINE from IS_SIGNABLE)\r\n\r\nMy solution was to create a new implementation of CKeyStore for external hd keys. \r\nThe old CKeyStore would still be used in non-external hd mode. \r\nAnd I would keep the WatchOnlyStore separately from those classes. (As the WatchOnlyStore still need to exist independently from the CKeyStore implementation use)\r\n\r\nBecause generated addresses would come from the CKeyStore, it would be considered \"IS_MINE\".\r\n\r\nThis PR was the first step: Separating `CWatchStore` from `CKeyStore`.\r\n\r\nI was attempting to slowly refactor the current flawed design until it get better. The design document though takes the bulldozer approach. (which might be OK, just harder)",
