   "body" : "After native build from source on Mac OS, my initial attempts to synchronize the blockchain were very very slow.  Upon finding [Issue Sync Taking Too Long](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10647), I found discussion by all and comments by @sipa in particular to be very useful, and reorganized $datadir folders on my local macOS build/install and summarized steps taken in file-partition.md doc.  These comments might find their audience more appropriately elsewhere, please feel free to suggest, thank you very much.\r\n-jimhash\r\nNote: This looks to be logged as issue: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10736",
