I have a need to find the address inside the HD wallet at a given HD path.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n- Derive address using the node i.e. `derivewalletaddress(path)` that returns the same as `getaddressinfo`\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n- Export xpub - not possible\r\n- Export the seed - `dumpwallet` only exports to file - cannot be used over network\r\n- `deriveaddresses` - requires xpub/xprv\r\n- `listaddressgroupings` + `getaddressinfo` for every address and find by `hdkeypath` - This is way too intensive\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSome context I found about xpub exporting explains that this is not possible: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/90149/106210\r\n",
