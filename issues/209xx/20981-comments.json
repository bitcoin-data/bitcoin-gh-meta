In either way, the documentation should make it clear for which blocks the data is passed. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7d8a10a6f4d61df1f4afb138e379149565afa02d/src/validation.cpp#L1946",

This would let us track things like \"how many times is a tx replaced / how many bytes were relayed before this payment confirmed?\"\r\n- Signature and script cache usage.\r\n- {Resource usage, rate of valid transactions} of our data structures holding invalid/unvalidated transactions: `m_orphanage`, `vExtraTxnForCompact`, `m_recent_rejects` filter\r\n- Query and hit rate for `LockPoints` cached in mempool entries\r\n- The \"shape\" of packages in mempools, e.g. number of direct parents vs total ancestors\r\n\r\n> NYDIG has a $4500 bounty for mempool tracepoints.\r\n\r\nIt's nice that there's a bounty to encourage contributions. I'm glad the bounty stresses the importance of a clearly-defined use case. We already have logs for {added, removed} mempool transactions, but there's definitely room for improvement. Hopefully NYDIG would be okay with different but still useful instrumentation?",

      "body" : "@glozow those would be some awesome use cases for ebpf tracepoints. Quite technical in their scope. I would like to take to working on a few of these points if desired. Number 1 has most of my interest.\r\n\r\n### In regards to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24935\r\nIn regards to my existing PR for mempool tracepoints should I remove mempool additions/eviction tracepoints as something to even pursue? Even if the NYDIG bounty no longer qualifies I want to contribute. Learning about the power of ebpf,usdt, and bcc has been a great addition to my skillset and has captured my interest.\r\n\r\n### Existing logging/tracing solutions in the mempool _(adds & evictions)_\r\nThe current in-mempool implementation seems to be using the ZMQ interface but doesn't currently provide a complete solution to trace all adds/removals from the pool.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 functions for broadcasting mempool events referenced in `txmempool.cpp` and one of them is not even used.  These are `CValidationInterface::TransactionAddedToMempool` and `CZMQNotificationInterface::TransactionRemovedFromMempool` \r\n\r\n - Currently `CValidationInterface::TransactionAddedToMempool` is not called anywhere in this repo\r\n - `CZMQNotificationInterface::TransactionRemovedFromMempool` is only called if the tx was not removed for the reason of 'BLOCK'. The current implementation instead leaves a multiline comment stating that to find the evicted txs from a block, look at the latest txs in the mined block. A valid solution but why not leverage a trace to to a sandboxed kernel program with extremely little overhead. Even if the user doesn't need this functionality it can even be compiled out into a nop instruction if built without tracing support. \r\n \r\nOn the topics of block evictions, they seem to be one hardest events to trace/log if the 256 bit txid is included since the volume of data being streamed is quite high with up to thousands of evictions in a very short time. Using a ringbuffer and a bpffs queue in tandem all mempool evictions can be logged in completeness and I am pretty sure they maintain the order eviction was requested in. \r\n \r\n### https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24935 eBPF solution to logging mempool additions/evictions\r\n\r\nFirstly by using eBPF tracepoints the overhead of tracing an event is minimal and isolated. bpftrace, python, and bcc scripts can be written in any manner desired to accommodate the collection of performance stats, testing, and custom user metrics. These custom scripts have no impact on the underlying functionality of the users current bitcoind build as all data is being passed though the kernel sandbox and the bitcoin core traces are a unidirectional event including a trace of all the txs being passed in and out of the mempool. \r\n\r\nThe example .py script implemented to trace mempool events in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24935 logs each request for a tx addition/removal from the mempool and the relevant information to validate/compare the current mempool with it's output. These logs are complete without erroneous data. The whole extended test suite was ran and It is possible to log all 328416 function calls to add or evict txs from the mempool. As a note even if these traces are determined to not be a candidate using some of the methods included in log_mempool_activity.py would be very useful in fixing some of the existing scripts that display incomplete data and/or have dropped events. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n_Edit: a word...phrases_",
