Argument for could be made as users may read sample config as a documentation instead of -help.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't so obvious to me that upping the `dbcache` would improve IBD based on the `-help` description. I propose that a better (newbie friendly) solution would be to prompt users on first run of IBD if they would like to increase `dbcache` and explaining the benefit of it. Of course, you may have to add a note to not increase cache past available system RAM to be completely fool-proof.\r\n\r\n\r\nfor reference, bitcoin-qt (v0.21.0) help description of `dbcache`\r\n```shell\r\n-dbcache=<n>\r\n       Maximum database cache size <n> MiB (4 to 16384, default: 450). In\r\n       addition, unused mempool memory is shared for this cache (see\r\n       -maxmempool).\r\n```\r\n",
