   "body" : "Hello, I would like to start a discussion about this snippet:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4a540683ec40393d6369da1a9e02e45614db936d/src/policy/policy.h#L31-L32\r\n\r\nNote that the limit of 300 MB was probably added as a DoS protection. I wish that this limit were reduced as explained below:\r\n\r\nNot every wallet supports RBF and it is very easy to make a transaction with a too-low fee. The problem is, after 14 days, the transaction is not dropped. Someone constantly republishes all low-fee transactions to an extent that you may forget about the 14-day limit. Other than CPFP, there is nothing to do in this case, but to wait until the mempool is cleared.\r\n\r\nWhat I suggest doing is, not letting transactions who can't make it into a block in 2 weeks to be dropped. 50 MB seems reasonable to me (Because most likely a transaction in the 51st MB won't be confirmed soon)\r\n\r\nMy arguments:\r\n- Mempool is a temporary place for transactions waiting to be included in a block. If we don't expect them to be in a block soon, they don't belong to Mempool.\r\n- If a transaction has a fee rate that is lower than the first 50 MB's, it is more beneficial for the user to be able to replace it with a better transaction and relay the newer one.\r\n- It is too easy to abuse and bypass the 14-day limit by re-pushing transactions, and transaction acceleration services directly profit from this. Hence the low-fee transactions are stuck until they're confirmed (unless CPFP)\r\n- It's unlikely that low fee transactions are intended to be used in 0-conf payments.\r\n- This doesn't affect mining pools' profits: They can set `-maxmempool=3000` and if a newer transaction with a higher fee is not published, they could still mine the low-fee transaction. In fact, this would increase their profits since the average fee rate would increase with this.\r\n\r\nSo, this is about standardness of being able to update a hopeless transaction.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts? Waiting for 300 MB before starting to drop transactions is ridiculous. And if your transaction is in the 299th (or 99th) MB, that's worse than having set an even lower fee. We need to remove the merit of *transactions that reach the 300MB limit*.",
