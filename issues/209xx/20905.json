I had recently uninstalled it, and today attempted to re-install, but, after running setup, on attempting to open bitcoin-qt.exe, the following error appears:\r\n\r\nAssertion failed! Program: C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin-qt.exe File: wallet/scriptpubkeyman.cpp, Line 720 Expression: mapKeys.empty()\r\n\r\n...with three options, Abort, Retry, and Ignore. Running from the command prompt with -rescan does not help.\r\n\r\nAny assistance would be very much appreciated.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nThis happens consistently when opening bitcoin-qt.exe, including after uninstalling and reinstalling further. I have tried installing on both a C:\\ and D:\\ drive, and the same error appears on both.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\nI am running bitcoin-0.20.1-win64, Windows 10. Downloaded from bitcoincore.org.\r\nC:\\ is SSD, and D:\\ is HDD.",
