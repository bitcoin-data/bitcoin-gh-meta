And i always wait for it to do it's thing before doing anything else.\r\n- The taskmanager does **not** show wich process is hogging memory - that is what is really weird to me. It is however very clear to me that it *only* happens while I have Bitcoin Core running. The _bitcoin-qt.exe_  process is growing in memory use, but no where near what could explain that almost all of my 32 Gigs of RAM beeing used, and _bitcoin-qt.exe_ does in fact release what task manager show it is using.\r\n\r\nTo further explain the memory consumption is happening really really slowly - i changed the update speed of the task manager from normal to low hence the 4 minutes window is shown in screenshot above, to show it graphical there.\r\nI don't know if this helps but here is a task manager screenshot ~10 minutes after i started bitcoin core today. It is 95% done with the initial sync. says it still got 15 hoursto go. I will see if i can remember to take a similar screenshot in a few hours to comparison.\r\n![SkÃ¦rmbillede 2021-01-11 105758](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3484684/104167034-f5c29980-53fb-11eb-961a-9e24638d83ac.png)\r\n",
