So the problem most likely is due to the text mode and Windows using CRLF instead of just LF.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw this problem, I thought it was memory corruption.

I found out that when saving a binary PSBT to disk the file contains CRLF (`0x0a`+`0x0d`) for new line separation *but* the clipboard PSBT Base64 version which is generated prior to saving the PSBT file is valid and has LF (`0x0a`) as expected. (This correlates with text/binary mode finding stated above.)\r\n\r\nSo, If anyone else is running into this, a quick workaround until a patch is available would be to save the binary by decoding the Base64 PSBT.",
