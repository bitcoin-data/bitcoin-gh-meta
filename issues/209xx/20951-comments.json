There will either be exactly the same fee, or the fee will be higher for APS.\r\n\r\nThat aside, I'm +/- 0 on your change. The wording changes the perspective from \"avoiding partial spends at the expense of slightly increased fees\" to \"doing partial spend to decrease fees\". I think the latter will confuse existing users as to them there is no decrease, only an increase.\r\n\r\nEdit: actually, I do think the \"difference\" part in the original should be \"increase\". ",
