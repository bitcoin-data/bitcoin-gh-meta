You mentioned that\nwe should get that in first.\n\nI don't think we decided what arguments the static traces should have\nyet. In my connect_block example I was only passing the height, but we\nprobably want to pass a few more things.\n\nSome goals for static traces should be:\n\n  - Somewhat stable API (order of arguments don't change) so people can\n    rely on these for scripting\n\n  - Some motivational use case\n\n@0xB10C's connected_block trace looks useful as well.\n\nCheers,\nWill\n",
