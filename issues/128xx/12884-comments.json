My only concern with excluding so many checks in the overall linting process is that it the exceptions can easily start to become the norm. \r\n\r\nTaking `E501` as an example there are close to 3,000 instances of lines that are too long per PEP8. Just eyeballing this a lot of them are only a few characters beyond the 79 char standard limit and I'd question for readability purposes if we really *should* allow those exceptions.\r\n\r\nBecause I haven't seen it in the code, you are aware that flake8 accepts inline comments to make exceptions right? So instead of ignoring at the overall CI level you could do something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n...some_really_long_url_on_one_line  # noqa: E501\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the linter will ignore that particular line, while still catching others.
