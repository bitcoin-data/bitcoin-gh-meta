All keys in the wallet should be set to include the unscanned range upto where then node keeps full-blocks (and can rescan from).\r\n\r\nThe ranges should be conservative so that the wallet can be quite confident that it knows about all the transactions that are not inside the unscanned ranges.  The wallet may also know about transactions that are inside the unscanned ranges.\r\n\r\nNote: Updated upon @sipa 's comments that the wallets already have implement many similar behaviour to what is described.",
