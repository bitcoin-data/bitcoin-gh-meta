It's useless and inevitably slower for just storing the data (blocks and chainstate) locally.\r\n\r\nIt's an interesting technology for accessing blockchain data over the network, though. The naive approach, sharing Bitcoin's LevelDB files on IPFS UnixFS (e.g. \"uploading\" the Bitcoin folder in the WebUI), isn't very useful.\r\n\r\nBy using IPLD however, one could directly traverse the Bitcoin blockchain over IPFS in its binary format even using the same hashes as on Bitcoin (albeit with prefixes) to address content.\r\nIt's a nice technology that could be used to (partially) replace the `inv` mechanism used to share Bitcoin data peer-to-peer.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of an Ethereum block accessed over IPFS. It seems like Bitcoin bindings also exist. https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-bitcoin\r\n<img width=\"942\" alt=\"Ethereum/IPFS\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21371810/56856592-43fce400-695e-11e9-92d3-171c5a11b9a6.png\">\r\n\r\nRead more at https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/263",
