   "body" : "This code was previously part of ConnectBlock() hence the log string, at some point it was moved to WriteUndoDataForBlock(). It seems sensible to me to use the magic constant __func__.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to update several other places where __func__ has been used intermittently. It's helpful to make logging code more dynamic, but also remove logging code from grep results when searching on function name. I was actually grepping ConnectBlock() and saw this misplaced result, ConnectBlock() itself has several logging lines that both use and do not use __func__, it's somewhat piecemeal.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure whether use of __func__ falls under the category of style but the change in this pull request changes a incorrectly labelled log entry.",
