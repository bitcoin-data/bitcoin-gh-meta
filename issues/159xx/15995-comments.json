If the `/etc/bitcoin` directory was created by `systemd` with `root` ownership and `0755` permissions, the just created `bitcoin.conf` file (e.g., `touch /etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`) will acquire the same permissions. It means `bitcoin.conf` will be readable for all users.\r\n\r\n2. This PR looks like a bad trade-off between first-time setup convenience for long-term security.\r\n\r\n3. [The best practice](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/init.md) is:\r\n> The configuration file, PID directory (if applicable) and data directory should all be owned by the bitcoin user and group. It is advised for security reasons to make the configuration file and data directory only readable by the bitcoin user and group. Access to bitcoin-cli and other bitcoind rpc clients can then be controlled by group membership.\r\n\r\n@sipsorcery \r\n> the PR doesn't affect the permissions on the bitcoin.conf file.\r\n\r\nYes, it does.

On the one hand I see the problem with having the config file world-readable due to RPC secrets; on the other hand, if one wants to run with the default settings and doesn't care about putting a `bitcoin.conf` in `/etc/bitcoin` the current systemd service file simply creates the the directory with the wrong permissions. I think @ryanofsky's `chgrp` suggestion is the best of both worlds, will experiment with that and update my PR if it works.",

Without `-conf=/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`, `bitcoind` would default to iiuc `$HOME/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` (with `$HOME` set by the `bitcoin` user), preventing further hardening measures such as `ProtectHome=true` (assuming the `bitcoin` user's home dir is `/home/bitcoin`).\r\n\r\n> 3. The best practice is:\r\n> `The configuration file, PID directory (if applicable) and data directory should all be owned by the bitcoin user and group. It is advised for security reasons to make the configuration file and data directory only readable by the bitcoin user and group. Access to bitcoin-cli and other bitcoind rpc clients can then be controlled by group membership.`\r\n\r\nThis looks like it might also need fixing; there is no point to separating the config file out from the writeable datadir if you are going to make the config dir writeable by the user executing the service; making the config file readable but not writeable by the user executing the service is the whole point of having separate data- and config dirs; this is also why systemd does not `chown` the `ConfigurationDirectory` to the `User` and `Group` specified in the service file.",
