   "body" : "The transaction fee; recommended; only seems to be calculating 1% of what it should be and this is causing transactions to hang or not get processed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nI have spent three lots of coins from my bitcoin core wallet.  In each case the fee has been set to automatically calculate.  I do not believe I changed the parameter since installation and it is set to Confirmation Target Time of 60 minutes, which, when initially writing this, was supposed to be 0.00064232 BTC/kb. \r\n\r\nThree transactions - lastly a transaction size of 221 bytes (0.221 kbytes] the expected fee from two weeks ago, based on the 0.00091727 BTC/kb, should be about 0.000203.  However the fee charged is only about 1% of this 0.00000238 BTC, seemingly out by a factor of 100.   It is now confirmed but attempting to accelerate on pool.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/ failed because the fee was too low!\r\n\r\nSecondly - A similar small fee of 0.00000224 BTC was applied on a previous transaction two weeks earlier.  I have no idea of what the calculation BTC/kb would have then been.\r\n\r\nAnd thirdly - a transaction another week earlier had a fee calculated of 0.00001194 BTC or 0.0000632 BTC/kb, I again have no idea of what the BTC/kb was at that time, but this is also seemingly out be a factor of 50 or 100.\r\n\r\nIf the calculation is out, using mBTC instead of satoshis or some such thing, then I worry any sudden change could adversely impact people who have identified the bug and have manually set their BTC/kb value to 100 times what it ought to be!!!\r\n\r\nAny workaround setting the BTC/kb value manually is really worrisome for anyone not using wallets regularly, I would worry I could pay 100 time more than I ought to! \r\n\r\n",
