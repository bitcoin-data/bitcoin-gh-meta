   "body" : "While investigating https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15948#issuecomment-489648141 I noticed that calling `RewindBlockIndex` and `GetNetworkHashPS` requires holding `cs_main` (due to accessing `chainActive`) without the functions being annotated as such.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply makes these implicit locking requirements explicit and adds two missing locks.\r\n\r\nThe only non-test caller not holding the now annotated locks was `AppInitMain`, but that was not a problem in practice since the `RewindBlockIndex` call happens before any background threads are started.",
