   "body" : "After switching to bitcoin 0.12, I'm seeing a rather concerning amount of unspent transactions:\n\n```\n$ bitcoin-cli listunspent | grep amount | wc -l\n734\n```\n\nWhich make it very painful (and expensive!) to sweep the wallet. Previously it used to hover around 10-20 unspent or so.\n\nFull dump of  [bitcoin-cli listunspent | grep amount](https://gist.github.com/RHavar/77cab9accc5c644fb64a) on bitcoin 0.12\n\nIf it helps, during the time period I have received about 2.6x as many transactions as I have sent. The average receive amount was 0.11 BTC, and average send 0.26 BTC.\n\nFrom the looks of it, it's as if it's trying to perpetually create change of 0.01 BTC, and never really inclined to spend from it. \n",
