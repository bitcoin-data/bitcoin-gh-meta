LevelDB runs in Chromium (`env_chromium.cc`) on Windows and is heavily tested there, but of course those APIs are Chrome specific. For Mac, Linux etc. it comes with an `env_posix.cc`. For Windows, Edouard wrote an `env_boost.cc`. All I did then was to make the MSVC specific stuff MingW compatible.

The authors/maintainers of LevelDB are some of the most senior engineers at Google. They are, to put it mildly, very busy. Nor do they particularly care about making LevelDB useful outside the Chrome context. As forks go, this one is likely to not be much of a hassle, but upstreaming the Windows/MinGW support likely is.\n\nI also don't see any benefit in depending on some other git repository via gitian, or making it easy for people to link against a dynamic libleveldb. There aren't any reasons why you'd have leveldb on your system. If somebody wants to modify the leveldb code, they could just as easily patch the version in the source tree.\n\nI think the whole libraries/dynamic/static/forking thing is a distraction. LevelDB is just code. There are no reasons you'd want to have it split out from the main codebase. Nobody should be upgrading the version of LevelDB Bitcoin uses unless they have a good understanding of both codebases, it's definitely not something that should just be randomly pulled in via an apt-get upgrade.\n",

If I disable signature checking, importing the entire blockchain (using -loadblock, a few weeks ago) took 7 minutes on my laptop (6 minutes when on tmpfs instead of disk, 5 minutes when I use an std::map-backed store instead of BDB). It was originally intended to reduce storage requirements and permit pruning, but because of the much smaller working set, there is a very significant speedup. Pruning isn't even implemented right now (but would be trivial), and I need a bit more time to do tests to verify that it works exactly as the current validation engine, but apart from that, it is mostly functional. I hope to have a pull request soon.\n",

It makes the qmake file (at least) pretty ugly. Is it possible to include the .cc files that we need in the build project like we do with spirit-json? I'm not sure this is a good idea either but I agree with @luke-jr that the current \"nested build\" setup is pretty ugly\n",
