But that's not a nice user-visible name, either :-)\n\nMaybe in the future when Bitcoin is a household name, getting a distinct name (\"Satoshi\"?)  will be more pressing.

If you can come up with a great proposal (and implementation) for re-branding that convinces all of the dev team then it's fine with me too.\n",

The \"Satoshi\" core of bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt is the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol; but end users don't even know that exists unless they open up Bitcoin-Qt's debug window.\n\nI'm not sure what's wrong with calling it Bitcoin-Qt like it always has been; there are plenty of software products that use Qt (or at least Q referring to Qt) in their names. But if alternatives are wanted, how about \"Bitcoin Fortified\" or something similar that expresses the fully verifying/secure feature of the client?\n\nAt the very least, Help->\"About Bitcoin\" shouldn't talk about something other than Bitcoin itself (maybe adding a real \"About Bitcoin\" menu item with a summary about the currency might be a good idea, though!).\n",

I'm also pretty sure that the wx UI simply called itself \"Bitcoin\" everywhere (but feel free to prove me wrong) as my first draft was an exact clone of that with Qt.\n",
