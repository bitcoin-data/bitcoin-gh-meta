This creates a perfect DoS attack. He can also skip IsStandard() and put non-standard txs into mapOrphanTransactions. Afterwards he can send a single tx that triggers the verification of thousands non-standard transactions at once, and I'm almost sure this can be used to mount a DoS.\n\nCreating transactions with IsMine() = true is also dangerous. The attacker can create a non-standard tx and send 0.0000001 to the victim's address and bypass penny flooding prevention and isStandard(). The peer would blindly relay that transactions to remaining peers. This could be used (although I didn't explore how to do it) to force the remaining nodes to block the victim's node. \n\nI find this change very disturbing, from the security point of view.\n",

It is only relevant if you own a high percentage of the nodes of the network, so you can chain transmissions until a miners node.\n\nMaybe what you want is to put the transaction into a special pool to monitor for 0-confirmations, but not for re-transmit.\nCould you explain what is the real benefit for you of this change?
