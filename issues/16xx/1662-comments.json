Or in better wording: The default setting of the client (sends by default from \"\" acc) will make balances per account misleading at least. \n\neg. if I had received 250BTC on 2 accounts, spent 450, and now the getbalance returns 50, getbalance acc1 returns 250 as well as getbalance acc2 - As a normal user I would think that something is broken...\n\nIf calculating balance from addresses bound to the account is not planned, than I think getbalance should only return total balance and the per account option should be disabled or moved to another command as they don't provide the same functionality.\n",

Otherwise it will become very complex, with two levels of nesting.\n\nThen again; many clients rely on the current behavior. Changing it will require multiple deprecation steps over a long time.
