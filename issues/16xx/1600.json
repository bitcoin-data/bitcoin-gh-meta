This is very annoying for two reasons. If one is creating an address to remain anonymous, you have no way to identify the newly created address from the existing ones, which makes the implementation of \"one address per transaction\" impossible. Secondly, since it's not copied to clipboard, you have to scroll through the address list (which can be very long) to find the address you just created so you can copy it.\n",
