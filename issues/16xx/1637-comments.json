Ultimately I think we need something that gets saved, though that brings up some extra challenges like needing to have a separated \"locked balance\" from \"balance\" so that uses don't get funds stuck in their wallet and have no way to figure out how (because they have balance they can't spend, or balance that isn't shown) \n",
