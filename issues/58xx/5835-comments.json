The attack is the attacker has 1000 valid signatures, 1 invalid signature; the time is wasted on the valid signatures; the invalid is just there to avoid paying fees.  I don't see a way to cheaply invalidate the cache on the valid signatures.\r\n\r\nThe P2SH limit is per signature, I'm pretty sure you can get1000 checksigs in an IsStandard transaction, you'd just use 66 inputs with 15 checksigs each. With unusual script pubkeys (op_dup-ing the signatures) such a transaction would only be under15kb I'd guess.\r\n\r\n[I think at worst this might just mean having a reason to keep a plain signature cache around. (Also) caching at a higher level makes sense if it saves that much time; though I'm surprised at that!]",

Both A and B spend X.   A wasn't in the mempool and will be a cache miss.  B is in the mempool, cached with inputs.HaveInputs(tx) passing.

This would result in accepting blocks containing double spend pairs where half is in the mempool; but I believe it's currently prevented by a redundant test in ConnectBlock.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to have a test there, I could see this invariant being broken very easily.\r\n",

      "body" : "I responded to Gavin, but now that I see this thread, I copy parts here:\r\n\r\nThe sigcache was added for security reasons and, as a by-product, it increases performance.\r\n\r\nWith a TxId cache you can achieve the performance part, but not the security protection.\r\n\r\nThe problem is described here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=136422.0 and only affects transactions during free forwarding (not in blocks).\r\n\r\nTo summarize the attack, the idea is that the attacker can send transactions that cost very little to create (can even reuse signatures with SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY) and fail to verify after a lot of CPU has been wasted, but still the victim peer does not increase the DoS score of the attacker.  For example, re-using 999 good inputs, but failing in the 1000th one. \r\n\r\nThe attacker can prevent DoS score to be increased because, there are two cases where it's not:\r\n- If an input refers to a immature coinbase (even if it's not owned by the attacker)\r\n- If an input has a not standard signature encoding.\r\n\r\nSo removing the sigcache has consequences.\r\n\r\nRegarding performance, take into account that each signature is verified twice in AcceptToMemoryPool(), one with standard flags and another with mandatory flags (for extra security), so if you take out sigcache, then you double signature verification time.\r\n\r\nSeveral solutions are possible:\r\n\r\n1. Add a second level of cache for TxId's and get an additional speedup. This is probably the simplest and best.\r\n\r\n2. Change VerifyInputs() so that it always increases the DoS score on a bad input, but the code explicitly states in one part:\r\n   \" Check whether the failure was caused by a non-mandatory script verification check ...; if so, don't trigger DoS protection to avoid splitting the network between upgraded and non-upgraded nodes. \"\r\n\r\nso you will be breaking this protection.\r\n\r\n3. Add a DoS check that accumulates the amount of CPU wasted by a peer  (e.g. processing good inputs before a bad input) and increase the DoS score if the waste is over a threshold. Node resource encapsulation likes this is something Mike Hearn and I had pushed in the past, and I think M.H. is crowdfounding money for that purpose in his lighthouse project.\r\n\r\nObviously the best is just adding a second level of cache of TxIds, without changing anything security-related. The cache also should cache the block number where the txId can be included, if the transaction uses locktime (if it's not re-verified, of course).",

      "body" : "@gavinandresen I've been running a version of this code overnight, and I'm curious if your results are similar to mine -- I'm typically seeing Verify times above 15 microseconds per txin, eg:\r\n```\r\n2015-02-28 02:41:57     - Verify 2671 txins: 39.67ms (0.015ms/txin) [443.41s]\r\n```\r\nwhich is an improvement, but still an order of magnitude slower than what you originally posted (1 microsecond/txin), so just want to confirm if my observations are consistent with yours?\r\n\r\nFor reference, my 10 fastest verify times out of the last 50 blocks (reported in milliseconds per txin) are:\r\n\r\n```\r\n0.009\r\n0.011\r\n0.015\r\n0.016\r\n0.016\r\n0.017\r\n0.017\r\n0.017\r\n0.018\r\n0.018\r\n```\r\n(I manually checked, and all but one of those times correspond to blocks with no cache misses; one of those 0.017ms/txin blocks had 1 cache miss.)\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell I'm puzzled by your comment earlier about the substantial gains from commenting out the duplicate HaveInputs call in CheckInputs -- I don't see how that could result in the speedups you mentioned, because the Verify time still includes one call to HaveInputs for every transaction in the block.  So it seems like it shouldn't be possible to get more than a factor of 2 speedup if the only change were to remove the second call, unless I'm missing something?",

I've tested this code and timed the calls in ConnectBlock which occur in the normal course of a node doing block validation, and this code looks to be roughly 20% faster for verifying blocks (even in the case of no cache misses). \r\n\r\nOf course I'm not trying to suggest a 20% improvement isn't a nice speedup, I just want to make sure we're all on the same page about what kind of speedup we're expecting!",

The attack uses multiple txs, so the cache at the txin level wouldn't help. \r\n\r\nLet's try to tackle the contention problem...\r\n\r\nOne solution could be a cache data structure where reads use only a lightweight mutex (such as a per-thread incremental variable), and writes must be delayed until all reads have been performed (using a spin-lock over all the per-thread mutexes).\r\n\r\nIf the bottleneck is block processing, then why not acquire a lock to the cache before processing the block, and delay all writes into thread specific caches until the full block has been processed ? Then all per-thread caches are merged back into the main cache. Then contention is eliminated, at the expense of some kind weakness to a DoS where the same signature is used again and again for all transactions (e.g. using SIGHASH_SINGLE bug). Maybe we could add a special mutex protected cache only for SIGHASH_SINGLE signatures where an input that has an index bigger than the maximum output index.\r\n",
