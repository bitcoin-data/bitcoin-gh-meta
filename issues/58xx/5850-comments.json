The offset between the two magics for the repeated beginning of block  330405 is 25351 bytes and as far as I can tell, the file write pointer is only advanced in FindBlockPos() by full block size increments (+ 8 bytes for network magic and size).  I've scanned through my local block files for blocks that are 25343 bytes (+ 8 for network magic and size) and only really found stuff in much earlier (<300k) blocks.  (Incidentally, I also tried 25351 and 25351+8, and nothing within a thousand blocks, although 334940 is 25359 (25351 with network headers).\n\nI've also poked around looking for orphans that are this size (blockchain.info, is there a better place?) and haven't turned anything up.\n\nI'm tempted to believe that there may indeed be corruption of the block index database itself, as it stores both the offsets for within files and the erroneous entry for 330388.\n\nTo dig deeper, I think I'd want to dump the entire block index (and the block file index) and compare it to the entire block file set...  I dunno if that can be easily shared somewhere though... \n",
