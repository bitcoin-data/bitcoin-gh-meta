Thanks everyone here for the suggestions.\n\nI am not quite sure how to proceed, so here is what I have discovered, perhaps everyone here can make suggestions about the best route forward.\n\n[Here's the gist of the program I used for testing](https://gist.github.com/dfletcher/e7ee74166ce9bd6bdd58). Edit: oh, right. don't forget to build using mingw with -mwindows flag.\n\nEdit2: Whoops my bad, Sleep takes milliseconds arg not seconds. Gist and table below updated, self exe is not always async. Thought that seemed funky. And really the \"s\" of the whole CreateProcess() column is because my code waits. We could change that behavior and be always async there.\n\n|  | CreateProcess() | ShellExecute() | ::system() |\n| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| **.bat script** | n s | n a | p s |\n| **self exe** | n s | n a | p s |\n| **pythonw.exe** | n s | n a | p s |\n| **python.exe** | n s | n a | p s |\n\n<sup>**Key**: p = popup, n = no popup, s = synchronous, a = asynchronous</sup>\n\nEach method has own strengths and weaknesses.\n\n### CreateProcess()\n\n**Pros**\n- No popups.\n- Straightforward command implementation, pass whole command string to windows.\n\n**Cons**\n- As laanwj pointed out it is using &strCommand[0]. Reason is that CreateProcessW might change that data, so we can't pass a const. \"[The Unicode version of this function, CreateProcessW, can modify the contents of this string](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682425%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)\". Why this affects the non \"W\" version I have no idea. Is the fix to copy the string? Or to just cast c_str() to (char*)? Unsure.\n\n### ShellExecute()\n\n**Pros**\n- Very consistent results while using SW_HIDE in the sixth argument of ShellExecute().\n- (Possible pro) users can change the SW_HIDE to SW_SHOW to change this behavior in a local build.\n\n**Cons**\n- Command must be parsed. The gist above only breaks on first whitespace, this would need to be smarter (accept a quoted string).\n\n### ::system()\n\n**Pros**\n- Simple.\n\n**Cons**\n- Popups everywhere!\n\nThoughts and opinions? Thanks again for the feedback!\n",

My test script this time is just a .bat piping the block hash to a file. It added 145 blocks to the output file really quickly and was not noticeably different from running it without the script. Would walletnotify be appreciably different from that? What's a good way to test it I wonder? Guess I could trash my blockchain and let it reload with a walletnotify script. Suggestions on what to put in it?\n\nEdit: oh hum I probably don't have enough tx in my testnet wallet to really \"stress\" test anything. Other ideas for approaches to this?\n\nEdit2: watchonly addresses I guess, could just add tons of them. Is this worthwhile?\n\nEdit3: Well I'm not really sure how to measure the results of this, so I'm leaning towards not testing walletnotify explicitly for performance. Intuition tells me this is a more efficient solution than ::system() just for the raw fact that Windows doesn't have to setup/teardown a window for each launch.\n",

We can prepend `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /C` to the user command and force it to execute in a shell. Of course, the code would need to be better than just hard coding C:\\Windows.\n\ntl;dr: The two choices I can think of is either use the fallback solution or call an interpreter by hand.\n\nOther ideas?\n\nEdit: oh I'd just like to add, using the interpreter actually works very nicely. No popup and it pipes to file as expected. My vote on how to implement this is heading in that direction.\n\nEdit2: just [updated the gist](https://gist.github.com/dfletcher/e7ee74166ce9bd6bdd58) to use GetSystemDirectory(). Could work. Edit3: gist makes a vector. Edit4: it now does that in a nicer way using a stringstream. Edit5: Travis seems okay with this solution :+1: \n",
