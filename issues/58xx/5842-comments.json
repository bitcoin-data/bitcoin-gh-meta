This shouldn't be hard, as ActivateBestChain knows what tip we're working towards, so it could be passed down.\n\nAlso, I think you need a check to have a reasonable guess that pindexBestHeader is reasonably accurate/recent/valid, so you can't be cheated into skipping validation while being sybilled during IBD.\n\nFurthermore, just height can probably be skewed by an attacker. I think it's safer to look at difference in nChainWork, and divide that by best difficulty seen.\n\nAlso, removing the checkpoint verification before accepting a header means you're vulnerable to a memory usage DOS attack during IBD (a peer can give you a arbitrarily long low-difficulty headers).\n\nI'm generally in favor of reducing the relevance of checkpoints, but I think this patch is a way too large step at once. \n\nEDIT: fixed wrong code example\n",

It's set far enough back that it has no effect on the network consensus, in practice, but it causes a lot of confusion.\n\nI think it's fundamentally dishonest: we intentionally do it in a way that doesn't influence consensus in practice, but let people who want it to matter because they can't wrap their head around bitcoin think it does; but if they go to far and believe its where the system consensus comes from and start suggesting other \"optimizations\" like 'checkpointing' blocks minute by minute only then do we correct them... and I think shouldn't be continued.\n\nThe script checking skipping is a historical accident (driven primarily by a huge slowdown that was caused by a coding glitch: use of mlocking secureallocator in places it shouldn't be used) that has turned into a crutch that we're now dependent on. We shouldn't let the dependance for one thing cause a lot of other baggage: We don't need checkpoints for initialization short cuts.  The primary concern raised with doing short cutting based on work burrying a block was incentives with reorg attacks. I believe they can be completely mitigated by making the shortcutting an initialization time one-shot (even saving to the shortcut criteria to the block index, so reindexing doesn't expose you to it again).\n\nI agree with laanwj that we should just one by one remove the unnecessary use, then we would be free to handle whatever remains.\n",
