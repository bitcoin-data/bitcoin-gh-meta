This is not new, but was not checked earlier.\r\n\r\nFully valid public keys with embedded data could be created by `[prefix|1 byte][payload|31 byte][ecdsa point modificator|1 byte]` (or less) where the last byte is modified, until it forms a valid coordinate.\r\n\r\nSee @petertodd's blockpop library: https://github.com/petertodd/blockpop/blob/master/blockpop/encode.py#L75-L101 or\r\nhttps://github.com/mastercoin-MSC/spec#class-b-transactions-also-known-as-the-multisig-method\r\n\r\nAnyway, OP_RETURN should be preferred, but just in case: http://redeem.bitwatch.co/",
