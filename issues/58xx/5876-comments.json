It sees a service bit and assumes that a new command is available as a result.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm suggesting is a service bit for command reflection itself, call it NODE_EXT_COMMAND which definitively makes the \"extension\" (or some better name) command available.\r\n\r\nFor your case, i'd see that bit set in version, then do \"extension getextsrv\" and parse the result. I could do the same for \"extension getutxos\".\r\n\r\nA service bit is not enough to know that a command is supported, because alternate implementations (or incomplete ones) can decide for themselves which bit to pick. That's very well illustrated by the fact that @jgarzik had to change bits after his original implementation due to a conflict.",

The current service bits are propagated with addr commands, but additional services provided by such an extension would not be. An extended advertising mechanism could be added, at the expense of more bandwidth usage, memory usage per known address.\r\n\r\nI'm personally quite conservative with regard to this. I think it is harmful to have too many services piggyback on Bitcoin's P2P network. Keep it simple. The exception would be communication that is relevant for node-to-node coordination, for example to advertise block ranges in the presence of pruning and archive nodes.\r\n\r\nMany of the proposed services however rely on a client/server view and that's not a good fit for a P2P network.\r\n\r\nHowever if people claim do bits and use them on the network, I suppose it's slightly better to have the displayed information reflect this to avoid collisions... so hence ACK on this.\r\n",
