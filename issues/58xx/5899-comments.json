I'd think that Stealth support would be great, but that's like moving mountains compared to what I'm asking for.\n\nEither:\n1. Expose `rescan` to rpc and startup `-rescan` flag and a parameter to accept the start block. By default, it's the genesis block. In other words, just expose the method `ScanForWalletTransactions` as seen here https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.10.0/src/wallet.cpp#L930 (Would probably want to modify `importprivkey` as well to have a parameter for starting block as well)\n2. Expose a method to add the transaction to the wallet i.e. `AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe` via RPC. Method found here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.10.0/src/wallet.cpp#L684\n\nEven better, add both changes. \n",
