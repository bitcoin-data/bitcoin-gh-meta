      "body" : "@ch4ot1c Thanks for confirming what you see!\r\n\r\nI'm convinced that this behavior is caused by middle boxes. The OP could confirm with a little command line inspection using tools like `netstat`, `ss`, and `tcpdump`. He could verify that both sides think the connection is established and that some packets are sent, but not received, when this condition occurs.\r\n\r\nWith the middle box idea in mind, I've reproduced this behavior with a topology spread across multiple hosts with multiple NATs and firewalls in between.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that the ZMQ PUB sockets are not being created with TCP keep-alive enabled (i.e.- SO_KEEPALIVE, or more specifically to libzmq, setting `ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE` to 1 in `CZMQAbstractPublishNotifier::Initialize`) This is easily verified with th the `-o` option to `netstat` or `ss`. I think enabling TCP keep-alive is what we want to do here because we want to keep the connection alive and we are not concerned if the other side is alive (what app level heartbeating is designed to do). Plus, using the TCP keep-alive options means we don't have to bump the min required library version (the heartbeat options are newer, see https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.2.0).\r\n\r\nSo, one way we can go is to set `ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE` to 1 and then use the operating system provided defaults for keep alive interval and probes to fail before killing the connection. That works for me when the OS settings are set low enough to keep the middle boxes from forgetting the connection. The values must be set before ~~starting the bitcoin process~~ the connection is established.\r\n\r\nThe other way we could go is to set `ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE` to 1 and then also provide bitcoin command line args to customize the other ZMQ ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE_* socket options (see http://api.zeromq.org/4-2:zmq-setsockopt).\r\n\r\nFor more on the OS keep alive settings see `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time`, `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl`, and `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_probes` in `man 7 tcp`.\r\n\r\nSo I don't forget, something like this works (added in `src/zmq/zmqpublishnotifier.cpp` before `zmq_bind`):\r\n```\r\n        const int so_keepalive_option = 1;\r\n\r\n        rc = zmq_setsockopt(psocket, ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE, &so_keepalive_option, sizeof(so_keepalive_option));\r\n        if (rc != 0)\r\n        {\r\n            zmqError(\"Failed to set SO_KEEPALIVE\");\r\n            zmq_close(psocket);\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n```",
