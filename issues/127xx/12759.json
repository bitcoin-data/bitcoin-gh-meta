   "body" : "The developer notes file has gotten pretty large and unwieldly. This reorganizes some content, most notably by adding a TOC to the page. Compare how the page looks in [my branch](https://github.com/eklitzke/bitcoin/blob/developer-notes/doc/developer-notes.md) vs [master](https://github.com/eklitzke/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md).\r\n\r\nI know there's long-term interest in moving a lot of this content to the bitcoin-core/docs repo on GitHub, but this makes things better now.\r\n\r\nThe TOC format here is a semi-standard extension to Markdown files that you may have seen on GitHub pages in other projects. The `<!-- markdown-toc -->` comments used by these tools to know where the TOC starts/ends. The following tools all understand this format:\r\n\r\n * [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)\r\n * [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)\r\n * [markdown-toc.el](https://github.com/ardumont/markdown-toc) (what I used)\r\n * various plugins for [vim](https://github.com/mzlogin/vim-markdown-toc) and other editors\r\n\r\nI used this TOC extension at a previous job, and my observation is that it's fine if people just edit the TOC manually. It's just text and it's not a huge deal if it gets a little out of sync. It can also be regenerated at any time by anyone with any of these tools.",
