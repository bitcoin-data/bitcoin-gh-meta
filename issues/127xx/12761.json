   "body" : "I think RPC documentation should be separated from the C++ code itself.\r\n\r\nIt makes building more tools based on it needlessly [complicated](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org/pull/526), and it also pads the RPC code too much.\r\n\r\nI have been thinking how to separate the RPC docs strings from the code itself. My 3 ideas\r\n\r\n* make some preprocessor macros and the documentation will be copied to the source code by the C++ pre-processor - that could be a good solution, but maybe hard to decypher?\r\n* keep the docs at separate files (in plaintext/possibly even markup) and let bitcoind read them at runtime - that could create annoying dependencies and probably introduce parsing errors?\r\n* keep the docs at separate files (in plaintext/markup) and \"transpile\" them somehow to the C++ code at make step\r\n\r\nDo you think it's a good idea? And which of the three possible ways is best?",
