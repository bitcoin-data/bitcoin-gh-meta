I have some bigger changes planned, though (see below).\r\n\r\n> Declare `SigningProvider` in its own header file;\r\n\r\nI disagree. `SigningProvider` is part of the signing module. It's the interface you need to implement to use the signing logic. Making keystore a separate module was partly responsible for it gaining many of its unnecessary responsibilities.\r\n\r\n> Rename the variable names where its type has been refactored from `CKeyStore` to `SigningProvider` to `signingProvider`-like equivalents.\r\n\r\nIndeed, but there are many more changes coming here, and I'd like to avoid code churn.\r\n\r\nIn a way, I think, `SigningProvider` is what `CKeyStore` should have been. At the time it was created, it was necessary to break a cyclic dependency between script and wallet, and `SigningProvider` would have been sufficient for that. However, instead of just being the interface to provide information to the signing logic, it became the class that was actually responsible for maintaining that information. Later is was extended with even more responsibilities (maintaining all information to determine whether an output is ours, rather than just information for signing).\r\n\r\nEffectively keystore now manages a rather arbitrary subset of the wallet's data (keys and script and watchonly, but no key chains, pool, labels, metadata) - which isn't even enough to fully control the \"which outputs are ours\" concern now that HD derivation etc are implemented. I think keystore should either be fully merged back into wallet, or be extended to become the storage of all \"record\" related information (see the gist linked to in the PR description).",

It's the interface you need to implement to use the signing logic.\r\n\r\n`CKeyStore` and `CBasicKeyStore` only seem to use the signing module by way of implementing the `SigningProvider` interface class. Decoupling the `SigningProvider` interface class doesn't conceptually change that design if you would keep the `signingprovider.h` and `sign.h` header files together, but it will break the compilation dependency between the signing module and implementations of the `SigningProvider` interface class.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is just a friendly clarification. I am not pushing back on the concept (it wouldn't surprise me if I am still missing something very obvious).",
