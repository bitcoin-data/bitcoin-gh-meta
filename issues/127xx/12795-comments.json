Not transforming filenames has the advantage that wallets can be identified with the same names everywhere: on the command line, in conf files, in listwallets and getwalletinfo output, and in the gui. This means fewer opportunities for confusion.\r\n\r\nIt would be really ugly if the software were adding extensions automatically and then leaking them into the gui, exposing internal layout of wallet databases. But that's not what is happening here. What's happening here is that the user is specifying a filename with an extension and the software is automatically removing it, making it more difficult than it needs to be to identify and distinguish wallets. Better, IMO, to just use names exactly as provided by the user.",

They want to create wallets and give them a name and eventually rename them later as well as use all sorts of special characters.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, the GUI should allow to dynamically create wallets where the user given wallet name could be completely different then the filename (filename could be a uuid similar to how other GUI applications work [like calendar apps]).",
