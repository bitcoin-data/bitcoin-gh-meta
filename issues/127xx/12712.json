   "body" : "With the new `AsType` function it's possible to serialize an object as another (compatible) type, and is intended for invoking the serializer of a parent class.\r\n\r\nWriting `AsType<Parent>(child)` will work in any context:\r\n* `READWRITE(AsType<Parent>(child))`\r\n* `s << AsType<Parent>(child)`\r\n* `s >> AsType<Parent>(child)`\r\n\r\nIn case child is `const`, the result will be a reference to a `const Parent` type, resulting in const-correct behavior.\r\n\nFor now this primitive isn't very useful, as the constness is statically known in each of the instances (so a simple cast would work). However, in #10785 I plan to modify the serialization code to have a single implementation which works on a const object when serializing and non-const when deserializing. `AsType` behaves correctly in this case, maintaining the constness of the argument. It's also safer, as this only involves automatic type conversions, and no explicit casts.",
