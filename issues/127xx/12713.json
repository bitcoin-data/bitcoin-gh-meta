   "body" : "This change explicitly enable tracking negated options in the option parser. A negated option is one passed with a `-no` prefix. For example, `-nofoo` is the negated form of `-foo`. Negated options were originally added in the 0.6 release.\r\n\r\nThe change here allows code to explicitly distinguish between cases like `-nofoo` and `-foo=0`, which was not possible previously. The option parser does not have any changed semantics as a result of this change, and existing code will parse options just as it did before.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is to provide a way to disable options that are otherwise not boolean options. For example, the `-debuglogfile` option is normally interpreted as a string, where the value is the log file name. With this change a user can pass in `-nodebuglogfile` and the code can see that it was explicitly negated, and use that to disable the log file.\r\n\r\nThis change originally split out from #12689.",
