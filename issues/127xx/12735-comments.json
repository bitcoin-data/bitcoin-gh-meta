Though, I wouldn't object changing to the pathlib module when you have to touch the file for other reasons or when using the pathlib module gives large simplifications.\r\n\r\n> New in 3.5\r\n\r\nUsing a method that is faster is fine, when it comes \"for free\". However, since we'd have to support python 3.5 for a while, I don't think we can do that anytime soon. Also, wherever this is used, the bottleneck is not in this method call, so probably not worth trying to optimize.",
