   "body" : "Using some recent build of master, I noticed that both the GUI and and `getblockchaininfo` is now showing the unknown BIP 9 fork activation warning: `Warning: unknown new rules activated (versionbit 1)`.\r\n\r\n`git bisect` tells me that this was introduced in #16060 in commit 1c93b9b31c2ab7358f9d55f52dd46340397c906d.\r\n\r\nThe warning only shows for the highest activated bit detected. During `git bisect`, I noticed that it would show `versionbit 0` activated after 1c93b9b31c2ab7358f9d55f52dd46340397c906d which then changed to `versionbit 1` after 0328dcdcfcb56dc8918697716d7686be048ad0b3. Some modifications to the logging and warnings indicated that both version bits 0 and 1 were being detected as having activated, just that version bit 1 was checked most recently so that is the one that shows up in the warning.\r\n\r\nLooking at the version bits checker, it looks like the issue is caused by having empty `ThresholdConditionCache`s (since these are not saved to disk) which won't have the Segwit or CSV fork conditions cached as their conditions were removed. A fix would be to always load the caches with fixed states that have Segwit and CSV activated, but I don't know how to do that.",
