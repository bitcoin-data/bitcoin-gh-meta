   "body" : "While working on #15931, I've tried to rationalize tx state management to ease integration of block height tracking per-wallet tx. We currently rely on a combination of `hashBlock` and `nIndex` with magic value to determine tx confirmation, conflicted or abandoned state. It's hard to reason and error-prone.  To solve that, we encapsulate these fields in a `TxConfirmation` struct and introduce a `TxState` member that we update accordingly at block connection/disconnection.\r\n\r\nFollowing jnewbery [recommendation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15931#discussion_r312576506), I've taken these changes in its own commit, and open a PR to get them first. It would ease review of aforementioned PR, but above all should ease fixing of long-term issues like :\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7315 (but maybe we should abandon abandontransaction or relieve it to only free outpoints not track the transaction as abandoned in itself, need its own discussion)\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8692 where we should cancel conflicted state of transactions chain smoothly\r\n* `MarkConflicted` in `LoadToWallet` is likely useless if we track conflicts rights at block connection\r\n\r\nMain changes of this PR to get right are tx update in `AddToWallet` and serialization/deserialization logic.",
