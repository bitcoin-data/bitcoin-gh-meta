   "body" : "Merges in detached release notes, edits each change down to a single paragraph bullet point (or, in a couple cases, two individual bullet points in separate sections each with a single paragraph).  Adds notes for some undocumented changes I found reviewing `git log --merges`.  Also tries something new: adds the PR number(s) after each entry to make it easier for both reviewers and end-user readers to look up the details behind each change.  (If the PR numbers are unwanted, they're easy to remove either in this PR or later in the release process.)\r\n\r\nI also checked the 0.18 branch but I didn't find anything in the current release notes that had been backported.\r\n\r\nA particular focus in my editing was trying to keep things concise, particularly by pointing to RPC documentation when available (or upcoming, as in #16629).  I do suspect that one downside of detached notes is that people write longer summaries than they would if they knew there were already 300 other lines of release notes.  :-)\r\n\r\nThe first commit only moves notes, puts them in bullet form, adjusts indentation appropriately, and drops unneeded headers.  It can be reviewed with `git diff --color-moved=dimmed-zebra` for a little bit of a speedup, but unfortunately I wasn't smart enough to split my copy/pasting and line wrapping into separate commits, so it's not a transparently move-only change.",
