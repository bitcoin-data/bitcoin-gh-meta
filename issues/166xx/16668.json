   "body" : "While checking #16661 I stumbled upon what seems to be a lifetime issue in `ReleaseWallet(CWallet* wallet)` (`wallet.cpp`).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fa6431055abfacea4f72ef11d061c7c755de327a/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L107-L111\r\n\r\nAfter `delete wallet;` the pointer is invalid and shouldn't be used like in the call `g_unloading_wallet_set.erase(wallet)`.\r\n\r\nThe code was introduced in #14941 which was merged into `master` on January 15, 2019.\r\n\r\nIn addition to fixing this specific instance it might be worth thinking about how we can use static analysis to automatically catch this class of issues going forward :-)",
