What's up with you people trying to cram everything together as if you paid a million dollars for every pixel?  Whitespace is good.\n\nI agree that it is mostly empty right now, but that's for lack of sensible things to put there. If you can think of anything that'd be useful for normal users to see when they open the client (or how to make it more \"balanced\" without cramming it full of debug info), feel free to suggest it.\n",
