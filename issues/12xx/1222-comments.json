I complete the set of themable toolbar icons by looking up icon names for overview and history that give proper results in, at minimum, these icon themes:\n   - GNOME 3 default\n   - Humanity (Ubuntu default)\n   - Oxygen (KDE default)\n   - Elementary (Lubuntu default and popular alternative)\n   - Faenza (popular alternative)\n   - Tango (popular alternative and recommended fallback style)\n   - All of the themes which inherit from the above to cover their gaps\n2. You use icons that are either from or in the style of Tango for the fallback. (Tango was specifically designed to be the best stylistic middle-ground possible so it could be used for embedded resources and fallback icons in cross-platform applications.)\n\nIt's also generally accepted by theme users and authors that, if they design a theme that is truly at odds with Tango (primarily by using a very different color scheme) and doesn't inherit from one of the other major themes, then they share responsibility in any consistency failures.\n",
