Now that I think about it, I remember installing bitcoin-qt and litecoin-qt as precompiled binaries (bitcon-qt from the PPA) while I had to compile feathercoin-qt from source. That could be the difference I'm seeing between the three clients here, I'll try recompiling bitcoin-qt from source and see what happens. :)",
