This is the EXPECTED behavior, the one I want to reproduce using XMLRPC.\n4. I rename account back: http://vvcap.net/db/NthP4EtVkOgKaOhpkCQj.htp\n5. Now I do the same thing using bitcoind, which uses same xlmrpc: http://vvcap.net/db/kxooAA7LiRhaa0ktxOBF.htp\n6. EXPECTED: old address is replaced with \"----> 02. Customer Actually Paid\" and not kept anywhere else in the address book\n\nOn 3.x versions, after that command, I have been getting address renamed, but \"----> 01...\" one relocated to a new. Same behavior I saw on another client, which I downloaded ~ 20-ish April 2012. I think it was 0.6.1, but maybe 0.6.0. According to the timestamps 0.6.1 didn't exist at this time, so maybe I'm imagining things. I did not take screenshots, and cannot reproduce it anymore.\n\nI retested now on all 0.6 versions and following are results:\n\n0.6.0 does not rename at all\n0.6.1 and 0.6.2 work as expected\n\nso I guess the bug is fixed. I have no idea why did I see that problem previously but not now. Since problem is not reproducibnle, I am closing the bug I guess.\n",

Instead of that account gets renamed AND an old label gets relocated. The code that does it is located in RPC, at function `Value setaccount(const Array& params, bool fHelp)`, so it affects both GUI and daemon, and I saw this code in every incarnation of bitcoin client RPC.\n\nWhat makes this bug extra annoying is that essentially it makes impossible to get rid of the label once it is in the database, unless you use GUI.\n\nIs it possible to get this addressed anytime soon? I'm so tired of having to recompile client every time a new version comes out.\n",
