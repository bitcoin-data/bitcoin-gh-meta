After fixing them, no more errors were reported.\n\nFurthermore, I let bitcoind run with that tool, along with another one which detects memory corruption problems (even more kinds of memory corruption than valgrind is able to detect), while confirming the latest ~150 blocks of the main net. It successfully confirmed them without any apparent problems.\n",

I have fixed that as you suggested.\n\nAs for the noinline attribute, it will work on any compiler that supports gcc extensions (it should work for gcc, clang and icc, at least), but I guess not for MSVC++.\n\nAs far as I could find out, there is no standard way of doing this, so we just have to use whatever syntax each compiler supports.\n\nI have updated the code to define a NOINLINE macro which will conditionally use syntax for gcc-compatible compilers (gcc, clang, icc), MSVC++ or emit a warning if the code is being compiled with an unknown compiler.\n\nI have re-tested everything with gcc and clang (with and without the fix, to see if the test still works), but I haven't tested with MSVC++ as I don't have access to such an environment at the moment.\n",
