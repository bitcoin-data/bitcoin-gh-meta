Not a supported configuration, and I believe it should not be one: it has high risk of being effectively an attractive nuisance where most of the time things will be fine, but then bite you (and others). Better to just adjust the bench instrumentation to provide accounting for it, which is enough for 99% of bench purposes.\n\nThis also bypasses all the soft-verify check stuff, like nop-non-standardness; which is a pretty dangerous thing to do; and could have bad effect network wide if some hypermiler decides to turn it on in their mining setup.\n",
