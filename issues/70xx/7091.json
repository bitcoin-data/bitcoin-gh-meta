   "body" : "Although the encapsulations necessary to expose VerifyScript in libbitcoinconsensus were done, we're still building it in different packages. Creating an independent consensus package will make much more clear which files are currently part of libbitcoinconsensus. Furthermore, other libconsensus-ready files like  arith_uint256.o, consensus/params.h, consensus/validation.h and primitives/block.o can be moved to that package already. This will make it harder to \"undo\" consensus encapsulation work while having travis happy.\nEvery executable that depends on the util and common packages now depends on the consensus package too.\nAlso, every executable depending on the consensus package seems to depend on the crypto package too, and libbitcoin_consensus only dependencies are crypto and libsecp256k1, so it doesn't seem to be of harm if we unify the crypto and consensus packages.\nIf we are going to eventually move all the libconsensus code to a subtree, this will make clearer which files need to be moved.\n\nI'm specially interested in @theuni 's and travis' opinion before I make some squashes and/or reduce the scope of the PR.\n",
