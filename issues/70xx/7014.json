   "body" : "BACKGROUND:\nI didn't understand the Receive screen on the Mac client at first. That's partially because, when I create new pay-to addresses, I usually do so just to copy the address. I don't typically include (or create) a payment amount, particularly when creating a tipping address for content. So when I went to the Receive screen, I thought there was a bug because every address just had \"(no amount)\" listed, rather than the payments I knew I had received to various address.\n\nSIMPLE SUGGESTION:\nChange the header for the column to \"Bitcoin Requested\" or \"Requested Amount (BTC)\" and that will make it more clear what the column is displaying.\n\nBIGGER SUGGESTION:\nAdd a new column that lists the total that's been received by each address, with a column header like \"Bitcoin Received\" or \"Total Received (BTC). This is very helpful if you're a content creator, and you assign different addresses to different content. The new column would really help me quickly see the relative tipping amounts for different content. I'm sure there are other uses for this additional info, and there's definitely room for another column (or two) on that screen.\n\nPerhaps a third column could be added, with a header that says \"Bitcoin Balance\" or \"Balance (BTC)\" for each address, largely as a way to make it clear that the \"Bitcoin Received\" column is not necessarily the balance held by that address. I also think a clear way to view every balance-holding address in the wallet would be handy (or at least interesting), so this is a step in that direction.\n\nPlease note I'm not a technical person, and this is my first Bitcoin Pull Request. I have no clue how much work it is to add these columns, but I think it would really improve the usefulness of this software. Thanks!\n",
