This is extra worrisome now that upnp discovery is off by default.\n\nThe result is that addrman only ever contains dns seeds and possibly static seeds in many common use-cases.\n\nPossible fixes:\n- Always set ipv4 to reachable. In practice we treat it this way anyway.\n- Set ipv4/ipv6 reachable once bound, regardless of whether it's routable.\n- Set ipv4/ipv6 to reachable once a respective connection attempt succeeds.\n",
