But since you donât seem 100% convincedâ¦\n\nLetâs say Iâve created 10 tipping addresses for 10 pieces of content Iâve created. And each entry in the Core client is labeled, so itâs clear at a glance which content each address is associated with. If I could see the total sent to each address in a newly-created column, that would make the software much more useful. Maybe the additional info would be useful to others too.\n\nThanks for considering it!\n\n> On Nov 13, 2015, at 4:35 PM, Pieter Wuille notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> Bitcoin Core wallet does not treat addresses as holding individual balances\n> - that's just an interpretation, and it doesn't work well with the use of\n>   random fresh change addresses.
