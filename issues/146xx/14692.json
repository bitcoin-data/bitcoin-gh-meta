This sort of works but I need to manually add nodes and then if a node is not open also to the outside I am in an isolate Bitcoin network. I also do not seem to be getting any inbound connections with onlynet=onion is this because my IP is always different under Tor and I need to post my .onion domain somewhere for people to find?\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n0.17\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nUbuntu 18.04\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
