Note that Luke only said he had no objection, not that he liked it, and we have hundreds of open pull requests to review, so a change which affects 102 different files without clear benefits is quite a burden on reviewers. So a NACK with good reasoning in this case is enough to warrant closure. Perhaps you could take a look at some of the open issues in the repository and find a different way to contribute :)",
