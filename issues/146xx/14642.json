   "body" : "I'm running a full node on Debian jessie. After upgrading from 0.16.3 to 0.17.0.1 I was getting this message from the daemon:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo\r\nerror code: -28\r\nerror message:\r\nVerifying blocks...\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt lasted for a couple of hours. I'm not an expert, and I didn't remember such a message after the previous upgrades. It was taking a lot of time, so I was concerned about possible errors or misconfigurations. It later finished and I could see the blockchain info again.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest to complete the above message with something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror code: -28\r\nerror message:\r\nVerifying blocks...\r\nChecking block N of M\r\nPlease wait until the verification is complete.\r\n\r\n```\r\nso that the user can check the progress of the verification and be sure the daemon is not stuck. Just my 2 cents, thanks.\r\n\r\n",
