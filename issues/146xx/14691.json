   "body" : "### Description \r\n\r\nExtended tests like feature_pruning.py create large blocks by making many large transactions with [a lot of OP_RETURNS](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/test_framework/util.py#L511-L527) in a single tx. Under this model roughly [14 of these transactions make a full-ish block](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/test_framework/util.py#L549-L560). \r\n\r\nThese transactions are already non-standard, so I have just modified the logic to instead just create 1 large output, making a single large transaction, mining a block of roughly the same size (947k). The reduction in tx creation / number of outputs seems to significantly improve performance. \r\n\r\nAnother optimization is to splice in the OP_RETURN output _after_ transaction signing, since it reduces the copying of the large OP_RETURN portion during signing. All signatures are `SIGHHASH_NONE`, so splicing after is okay. \r\n\r\nfeature_pruning.py has about a 1.5x speedup on my machine (~12 minutes down to ~8 minutes), and `mempool_limit`, and `feature_maxuploadtarget` seem to benefit as well. \r\n\r\n### Refactoring\r\n* The [original](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/test_framework/util.py#L511-L527) OP_RETURN generating function is now just a [string](https://github.com/conscott/bitcoin/blob/2018_11_opreturn_splices/test/functional/test_framework/util.py#L176-L192). If there is a better place to put this, I will move it. At the very least I just wanted to document the format because the previous function had little explanation for all the hex values. \r\n* `create_lots_of_big_transactions` no longer requires providing the OP_RETURN splice, and uses the default from before, with an optional `op_return_txout=` keyword args for using the giant OP_RETURN mentioned above.
