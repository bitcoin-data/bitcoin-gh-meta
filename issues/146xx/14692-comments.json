I desire a set up where I can configure if my node sends its transaction ONLY to outgoing connections OR inbound connections. I don't think the software can make that distinction though so it is probably easier to have an option that only broadcasts via onion, as someone else mentioned.\r\n\r\nOne setup is to configure Tor support to the node, the public key will get created, bhasdhsa.onion, as an example and I can give that to other people and I will have inbount connections via that onion service. The problem still exists where I will still broadcast to both onion and non onion.\r\n\r\nAnother setup is to have onlynet=onion so that my outgoing connections are only to onion services, previous nodes that added me would still be able to connect as my clearnet port is still open/working. Now the final kicker would be a setting such as 'onlybroadcast=onion' which will make my node only broadcast via .onion service outgoing connections but still receive transactions from clearnet via inbound connections. This should also help solve the \"Why bitcoin over Tor isn't a good idea\" scenario, because your node is still opened to the clearnet.",
