Upon launching the client it said that it needed to finish reindexing the blocks.  About shows - 0.8.6-beta.  Win7x64\n\nAlso, is it possible for the upgrade to transfer the coins out to a \"safe\" address if something goes wrong?  My coins were transferred out but I am not ruling out a malware issue.  If anyone could clarify that for me please.\n",

What I was doing was opening the 32bit version, as soon as I opened the 64bit version I could the 0.9.3\n\nThe now real issue is in 0.9.3 for windows x64 doesn't have an address book. I can't see my addresses, so I wanted to send someone bitcoins I would basically be screwed because I can't retrieve my wallet ID. \n\nI sent as a set some bitcoin from another wallet to my bitcoin one (the same ID I had in the 32bit one) and coins are coming in but everything is kept secret I can't see where it's coming from. When I try to add my ID back to the 0.9.3 it comes back and say that Wallet ID is already in your address book. (which I can't see).\n\nBug? I don't know.. but you shouldn't be stopping people from seeing their Wallet ID's.  \n",
