That's done to ensure that we're building from the same release tarball that we actually distribute.\n\nSo, the srcroot doesn't actually have a .git dir in it either. It only works because we've extracted this dir _below_ a git repo.\n\nWhat needs to happen is that a new file is created for tarballs, which is used as a fall-back when not using git. Similar to how git-version-gen scripts work. Like I said, I hacked on that some, but it only tangled things further.\n\nIf you'd like to ignore this and wait for a rework of the logic that's fine, I just didn't want to ignore the broken-ness for now. If nothing else, this fixes gitian builds.\n",
