That functionality is coming to travis \"at some point in the future\".\n\nThe major difference once we shut down pull-tester is that people will quit getting nag mails from it. I'm sure several devs count on reading those mails as a way to see what's going on with PR's, but I don't think there's really any way to prepare for the change other than to issue a warning and flip the switch.\n\nIf it's actually desired to test an old gcc, we can just add a row to the travis build matrix. I'm not convinced there's a need, though. I'd rather see bleeding-edge compilers tested (so that we know what's coming), rather than crufty old ones.\n",

The rest only does a build\n- However in pulltester the tests are executed for windows as well using 'wine'\n\nCan we get Travis to provide windows 32/64 bit test results using wine?
