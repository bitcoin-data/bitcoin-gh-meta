That seems to be correct.\n\nHowever, unless one is trying to make a minuscule payment, it seems that the likelihood to add a bigger UTXO at some point that would exceed the target should be sufficiently larger, than the chance that you'd only add inputs that inch closer and closer to the target to match it finally without exceeding it. It should rather be unlikely to even happen in 1000 iterations (gut feeling), so the patch should work fine in the majority of situations.\n",

I would expect this to result in grinding down the wallet into lots of dust change over time even worse than the current approach. \n\nGenerally, so long as it doesn't result in bloating things up to the point where the transaction confirms slowly, we should generally prefer to make transactions bigger (under the rational that transaction fees will increase over time or at worst stay constant).  E.g. If you already have a change output, a pass that looks at the scriptpubkeys you're spending and keeps adding more inputs assigned to the same pubkeys until the fee increase is some threshold or the change exceeds 2x the payment value (or something like that) would probably result in lower total transaction fees over time.

(I'll be adding the results later, when I am on the right computer.)\nI have started implementing the simulation in a compiled language to speed it up in order to do some more and bigger experiments.\n",

I am currently in my exam period and haven't had as much time to work on it, as I would like.\n\nI have tried a few different strategies to select coins, and have been experimenting with different distributions of incoming and outgoing payments.\n\nDifferent strategies:\n- \"Regular Wallet\" implements the algorithm currently in use as I understand it, to be used as a baseline.\n- \"Pruning Wallet\" selects the coins just like the regular wallet, but afterwards discards inputs that are smaller than the remaining change in the order they were selected.\n- \"Pruning Wallet with minimum number of Inputs\", like PW, but when pruning keeps at least the miminum number of Inputs.\n- \"Double Wallet\": Like PW, but when unable to directly match the target, aims for twice the target, in order to create change in the magnitude of what the user was trying to transfer instead of dust.\n\n---\n\nSome results:\n\nExperiment 1: \nStart: 5000 random UTXO from range(2500, 250000) satoshis\n10000 transactions (randomly 50/50 distributed incoming/outgoing) in the range(540,250000) satoshis\nRegular Wallet: 4853 changes created, in range(1,1591) satoshis, average change 63.01Â±97.78 satoshi, spent (1,12) inputs per transaction sent, average 1.44Â±1.15\n\n... writing up my results I realize that I will want to create a .csv instead of the current text-form result, sorry gonna go back to studying now, but I'll probably be able to do it in the next break.\n\n---\n\nSome questions I haven't been able to answer satisfyingly:\n- What would constitute realistic data for incoming and outgoing transactions of one wallet (how many incoming/outgoing transactions, what average size and distributions for each direction, is it necessary to regard the change in value over time)?\n- Haven't researched yet: When does the required transaction fee increase?\n",

      "body" : "Hi,\nFinished with my exams for this semester, finally had time to pick this up again.\n\n(When I created the .csv files with my output, I realized that my random models would sometimes generate spending instructions that asked for more than the wallet's current value. While those were were ignored as impossible, they still got into the statistics, so I wanted to fix that first.)\n\nI've been thinking about what one might want to be optimizing for. This is what I got so far:\n1. **Non-dust change**: The creation of small change outputs should be avoided. They bloat the blockchain and are expensive to spend.\n-> If a change output has to be created, it would be preferable to create a change output of the magnitude of the payment value. (Which would also help obscure recipient output and change output.) \n2. **Privacy**: UTXO should be picked non-deterministically, and as few different pubkeys as possible should be involved.\n-> Whenever the CoinSelection selects a UTXO, any UTXO assigned to the same pubkey should be preferred in selection.\n-> Small inputs that are significantly smaller than the size of the change and don't share their pubkey with a larger input should be pruned, as they increase transaction fee and decrease privacy.\n3. **Minimize transaction fee** A transaction input set should be preferred when it costs less to send.\n-> If spending some input costs more than what it contributes to the outputs it should not be added. Also, inputs that are extraneous should be pruned if that would lower the transaction fee.\n1. **Consolidate small UTXO?**\n   Once created, very small UTXO are in the blockchain anyway. \n   Is it preferable to spend very small UTXO, in order to remove them from the UTXO-pool, or to ignore them until they become valuable enough to spend in their own right?\n\nHere are the statistics from my latest experiment.\n![ex19](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4060799/4693226/ade9123e-578f-11e4-8765-653d41acc720.png)\n",

The data is sorted over time  (oldest at the top, newest at the bottom) denominated in bitcoins. \n\nThings to note:\n- deposits are only added to the list when they get 1 confirmation (so they tend to come in batches) and send amounts are added to the list instantly\n- At various times, the cumulative total dips below 0. This happens when people have won enough money to be able to withdraw more than the total people have put in the site.

This removes the performance impact per checked subset, and still makes sure redundant outputs are removed from the final result.\n\nI've managed to reproduce this as well. For e.g. these input values:\n\n```\nvValues = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 100, 1000]\nnTargetValue = 251\n```\n\nApproximateBestSubset sometimes selects `[10, 10, 1000]`. Postprocessing like this can drop the redundant `10` inputs.\n\nConcept ACK - this cannot make things worse. Would be nice to have a unit test.\n",
