Need something to go on here...\n\nI've seen some of our sanity checks fail on OSX (as intended) when I screwed up my toolchain (libstdc++ vs libc++ abi incompatibilities).\n\nWhat's unique about your build env? My first guess (complete stab in the dark) would be that you've built against a newer sdk without specifying 10.6 back-compat. Newer SDKs change libstdc++ symbol visibility so that exceptions aren't caught at runtime in older environments. That causes the exception to not be caught [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/compat/glibcxx_sanity.cpp#L54), so we bail.\n\nAgain, just a complete guess. Fwiw, I just tested a master build on 10.9 and all is good, but that means little in this context.\n",

I had a tiny suspicion that apple's c++ runtime might've been doing something unusual but legal and we should maybe relax the constraints, but that's not the case.\n\nAll of that to say... if we don't catch that exception, shutting down is certainly the correct response.

If it fixes your problem, I'll go ahead and add the documentation for using them. This is how we build releases, so it should give you the same results as our released binaries. If that fixes your problem, we can either stop there, or compare the results to see why your homebrew deps aren't working.\n\nfrom bitcoin srcroot:\n\n```\nmake -C depends\n./autogen.sh\n./configure --prefix=`pwd`/depends/x86_64-apple-darwin*\nmake\n```\n\nThe first step will take quite a while. It will fetch all of the dependency sources and build them from scratch.\n\nThere may be some issues related to 10.6 as it hasn't been tested there (which is why there aren't any docs yet).\n",

Many people still use older machines too. I personally have a early netbook running Windows XP with Armory.
