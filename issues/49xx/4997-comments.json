A lot of projects don't even have one in the repository at all and rely on people calling autoreconf manually. It's all up to us.\n\n(ie, make distcheck doesn't include it by default because it doesn't know about it... it could be called `crazy_developer_script.sh` and it'd be just as valid)\n",

Packaging a convenience script to regenerate configure or not doesn't make a difference at all.\n\nI think you are confusing including configure scripts, which is useful for building without developer tools, and is standard, with _excluding_ what is required to build configure. IMO that would be a bad idea, a tarball should be a just as valid starting point to make changes to the code as a git checkout.\n",
