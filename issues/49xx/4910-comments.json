It is good to be a well-connected peer early on to have many potential sources of blocks, and also to immediately be available to serve the blocks you have to others also getting caught up. Incoming transactions are also relayed and communicated to you when you are a full peer, even if they are not immediately spendable. Future improvements in blockchain downloading will only benefit from quick and early connections to the P2P network.\n",

There's no selection criteria for the \"best\" syncnode, so more doesn't equate to \"better\". \n\n> Well there is logic to only advertise when the initial block download is finished:\n\nYes, which is why I was deeply confused that I got bombarded with peer requests from remote peers when I was so obviously not in sync. There's got to be some logic flaw in the client somewhere, there's no way external peers should have been finding me otherwise. I looked in blockchain.info's peer log and bitnodes.io's log and found that they had never connected to this IP address before, so it's unlikely that it ever existed before the time when I started the node there. \n",
