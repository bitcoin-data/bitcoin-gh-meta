Not clear if Bitcoin actually ran the hard drive out of space (which could make for database inconsistencies or corruption). Not clear if Bitcoin was properly and completely closed before data files were manually moved.\n\nLocking fixes committed over the last year should have fixed the original result of running out of datadir space, which was to crash spectacularly.\n\nI think this is better resubmitted as an (improvement)(feature) request focusing on the specific area where improvement is thought to be needed. A really good bug report has a pull request, and if not, a specific code change request. I'll outline two feature requests that are compact enough in scope to be addressed:\n1. OS Installer: Include insufficient datadir disk space check/warning upon install.\n   \n   a. set minimum disk free space as educated guess for near future ~40gb (similar to checkpoints),\n   b. in case of reinstall, subtract existing %datadir%/blocks/*.dat file sizes from warning calculation.\n   c. write helpfile button for warning describing -datadir option to choose alternate data location.\n2. add installer wizard panel showing default datadir, with option to browse and select custom datadir (a non-default directory selection would be written to bitcoin.conf)\n\nI fear that disk space checking routines would be quite platform-dependent, needing a universal library to be included for this before one can think about what Bitcoin Core does with this information.\n",

      "body" : "The first time I installed the wallet I got down to 100 MB of free space, that's not really good for a system drive, there should be a bigger limit. \nAlso, the message \"Disk space is low!\" should be converted to something more like \"Your drive has ran out of space, the sync has stopped. Please change the directory or empty some space on the drive\" or something between those lines.\nTaking up the whole memory on the default partition which is in most cases system partition before it actually displays the mentioned message is not really a good thing.\n\nI am not saying the sync got stuck because of disk space but trying to find a reason for it, because I most surely transferred everything nice and normal to another partition and pointed the wallet to the new directory and it didn't want to continue syncing. So what could be the reason ?\n\nI think there is more improvement to be made on this issue and especially on that warning message and the limit to the disk space that blockchain download actually takes.\n",
