   "body" : "Move wallet startup code closer to a simple model where the wallet attaches to the chain with a single chain.handleNotifications() call, and just starts passively receiving blocks and mempool notifications from the last update point, instead having to actively rescan blocks and request a mempool snapshot, and deal with the tip changing, and deal with early or stale notifications.\r\n\r\nAlso, stop locking the cs_wallet mutex and registering for validationinterface notifications before the rescan. This was new behavior since 6a72f26968cf931c985d8d4797b6264274cabd06 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16426 and is not ideal because it stops other wallets and rpcs and the gui from receiving new notifications until after the scan completes.\r\n\r\nThis change is a half-step towards implementing multiwallet scans (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11756), since it provides needed locator and birthday timestamp information to the Chain interface, and it rationalizes locking and event ordering in the startup code. The second half of implementing parallel rescans requires moving the ScanForWalletTransactions implementation (which this PR does not touch) from the wallet to the node.",
