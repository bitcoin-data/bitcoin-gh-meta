   "body" : "Have been trying to import some recovered private keys into bitcoin core for the past 2 days. After syncing the entire bitcoin blockchain, I've verified the same using `bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo`.\r\n\r\nThen, I've tried to run `bitcoin-cli importprivkey the_key \"\" true` to enable a rescan after import (since I wanted to do one at a time, to verify spend-ability of balances).\r\n\r\nHowever, while looking at the debug.log, I notice that the rescan is complete, yet the balances are not updated across my wallets.\r\n\r\nSince I am unable to determine why the balances are not updating, I am trying to import the address into bitcoin core first before importing the private key.\r\n\r\nNote, that the private key I tried to import starts with a K and has 52 characters. The beginning part of the recovered path is: `m/44'/0'/0'/0/427`.\r\n\r\nI expect to be able to import these balances and make them spendable. However, I'm not even able to see the balances when running `bitcoin-cli getwalletinfo`.",
