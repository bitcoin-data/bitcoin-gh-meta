   "body" : "Per some discussion in #bitcoin-core-dev -- getdescriptorinfo should probably not canonicalize the descriptor given, but return it exactly as provided. This is because it is the easiest way to get a checksum for a descriptor written by hand, and it's profoundly annoying that there's no way to get a checksum for a non-canonical descriptor right now (one containing the \"h\" marker for hardened, or containing a private key.)\r\n\r\nAlso discussed was the possibility of switching the default marker from \"'\" to \"h\". The apostrophe is very annoying to work with over RPC because of quoting problems, which is why \"h\" is accepted. Better to just use \"h\" everywhere for the same reason.",
