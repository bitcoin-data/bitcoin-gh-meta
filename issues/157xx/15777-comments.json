These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to give out addresses or\n+ * send change to.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key had been generated, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * HD-split added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There is an external\n+ * keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool (for change\n+ * addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as a sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,",
