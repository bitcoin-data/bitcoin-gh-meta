   "body" : "Transaction relay is optimized for a combination of redundancy/robustness as well as bandwidth minimization -- as a result transaction relay leaks information that adversaries can use to infer the network topology.\r\n\r\nNetwork topology is better kept private for (at least) two reasons:\r\n\r\n(a) Knowledge of the network graph can make it easier to find the source IP of a given transaction.\r\n\r\n(b) Knowledge of the network graph could be used to split a target node or nodes from the honest network (eg by knowing which peers to attack in order to achieve a network split).\r\n\r\nWe can eliminate the risks of (b) by separating block relay from transaction relay; inferring network connectivity from the relay of blocks/block headers is much more expensive for an adversary.\r\n\r\nAfter this commit, bitcoind will make 2 additional outbound connections that are only used for block relay. (In the future, we might consider rotating our transaction-relay peers to help limit the effects of (a).)",
