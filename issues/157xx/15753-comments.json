This means that newlines, escape characters etc can be written freely.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps we trust our RPC clients to not perform such malicious actions?\r\n\r\nAlso: a test could be added checking that a RPC call `logprint` results in the expected log output?

You can look at a specific node's debug.log output and see logprint's from the tests directly.\r\n\r\n@promag The output from all combined logs is rather large, so having a way to see test debug log in individual node log files was convenient.\r\n\r\nFrom reactions I am starting to think maybe this is not what people want, so I will close this PR unless it gets more hearts.",
