   "body" : "(copied from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15638#issuecomment-479101494 by @ryanofsky) Here is how I am thinking about the organization:\r\n\r\n- `libbitcoin_server.a`, `libbitcoin_wallet.a`, and `libbitcoinqt.a` should all be terminal dependencies. They should be able to depend on other symbols in other libraries, but no other libraries should depend on symbols in them (and they shouldn't depend on each other).\r\n\r\n- `libbitcoin_consensus.a` should be a standalone library that doesn't depend on symbols in other libraries mentioned here\r\n\r\n- `libbitcoin_common.a` and `libbitcoin_util.a` seem very interchangeable right now and mutually depend on each other. I think we should either merge them into one library, or create a new top-level `src/common/` directory complementing `src/util/`, and start to distinguish general purpose utility code (like argument parsing) from bitcoin-specific utility code (like formatting bip32 paths and using ChainParams). Both these libraries can be depended on by `libbitcoin_server.a`, `libbitcoin_wallet.a`, and `libbitcoinqt.a`, and they can depend on `libbitcoin_consensus.a`. If we want to split util and common up, as opposed to merging them together, then util shouldn't depend on libconsensus, but common should.\r\n\r\nOver time, I think it'd be nice if source code organization reflected library organization . I think it'd be nice if all `libbitcoin_util` source files lived in `src/util`, all `libbitcoin_consensus.a` source files lived in `src/consensus`, and all `libbitcoin_server.a` code lived in `src/node` (and maybe the library was called `libbitcoin_node.a`).\r\n",
