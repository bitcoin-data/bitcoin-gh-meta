To welcome contributors also from the realm of mainframe super computing, bitcoin should use some of the lesser known features of C++: Digraphs.\r\n\r\nThis pull request replaces non-comment and non-string curly braces with their [equivalent digraph representations](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_alternative) `<%` and `%>`. I had to adjust the `check-rpc-mappings.py` linter a bit as it was not robust enough to deal with the full spectrum of expressivity that C++ offers.\r\n\r\nThis change should help users using [EBCDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC) or rather esoteric codepages like [DIN_66003](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_66003).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately [Trigraphs were removed from C++17](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4210.pdf), which is why I restrained from replacing symbols in string literals and comments.\r\n",
