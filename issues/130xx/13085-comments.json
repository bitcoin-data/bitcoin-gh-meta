      "body" : "> Looking here the ASM will convert byte arrays of 4 or less to an integer\r\n\r\nThat is not at all what this does. This is not a special case at all, nor is it specific to the ASM conversion, it is how scripts work.\r\n\r\nFirstly, OP_PUSHDATA4 does not mean that a 4 byte array is to pushed to the stack. OP_PUSHDATA4 means that the next 4 bytes should be interpreted as an integer which indicates the size of the next piece of data that will be pushed to the stack. ALL opcodes less than OP_PUSHDATA4 indicate the size of the next piece of data to be pushed to the stack. For all opcodes less than OP_PUSHDATA1, the single byte is the length of the data itself. For OP_PUSHDATA1, the next 1 byte indicates the size. Same for OP_PUSHDATA2 and OP_PUSHDATA4.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to have a 4 byte array with the string \"cats\", you would actually have 5 bytes, the first being `04` which indicates the length of the data and then the 4 bytes of data itself. You never just have data in a script without a length prefix.\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue with Bitcoin Core and such questions should be asked elsewhere such as on bitcoin.stackexchange.com.",
