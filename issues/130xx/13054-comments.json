Also this one had many Concept ACKs from different contributors (not going to list them, just scroll up a bit).\r\n\r\nSo I feel like there is a threshold where something controversial can be merged if it has enough support. Another way of thinking of it, which I sometimes use to decide if a pull request should be merged: \"Imagine this already was merged, but someone proposed to revert the change. Would it be worthwhile to merge?\"\r\n\r\nBack to this topic, personally I am a huge fan of the `__all__` import: https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package. I'd be in favour to take a step back and replace some of the explicit imports with an `__all__` import, where appropriate.",
