However, it was included in #12892 to remove controversy and ensure that PR could be merged.\r\n\r\nThere are two main reasons for removing this RPC method:\r\n\r\n- Labels are associated with addresses (rather than addresses being associated with labels, as was the case with accounts). The `getlabeladdress` does not make sense in this model and blurs the distinction that \"labels are associated with addresses, instead of addresses associated with labels\".\r\n- Keeping `getlabeladdress` requires keeping the whole CAccount administration in place. Part of the reason for the account to label refactor is simplify the wallet mess and to get rid of that.\r\n\r\nMany contributors have already concept ACK'ed removing this method (@laanwj at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12892#issuecomment-379611854, @PierreRochard at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12892#issuecomment-379874953, @promag at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12892#pullrequestreview-110855143, @jonasschnelli at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12892#discussion_r179550228)\r\n\r\nMain opposition to removing this method came from @ryanofsky and @luke-jr .
