The PR was broken up to make reviewing easier.\r\n\r\nThe intention is that literally all `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED`/`LOCKS_EXCLUDED`:s added in this PR should follow either directly or indirectly from `AssertLockHeld(â¦)`/`AssertLockNotHeld(â¦)`:s already existing in the repo.\r\n\r\nConsider the case where function `A(â¦)` contains `AssertLockHeld(cs_foo)` (without\r\nfirst locking `cs_foo` in `A`), and that `B(â¦)` calls `A(â¦)` (without first locking `cs_main`):\r\n* It _directly_ follows that: `A(â¦)` should have an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_foo)` annotation.\r\n* It _indirectly_ follows that: `B(â¦)` should have an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_foo)` annotation.",
