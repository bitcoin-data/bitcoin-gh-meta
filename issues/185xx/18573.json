   "body" : "This adds a new binary, `bitcoin-asmap` that can be used to construct, inspect, and query asmap files. It replaces the Python scripts I had at https://github.com/sipa/asmap with something more performant, efficient, and auditable.\r\n\r\nThere are some rough edges still (in particular documenting the code and a number of edge cases), but I'd like to offer it for comments here. I'm not sure we want this code to be part of the Bitcoin Core codebase, but it certainly has advantages (in terms of code reuse and having consistent encoder/decoder). I think it may also be beneficial that users have a way to audit these files using code that's subject to our review and testing process.\n\nThis PR includes a fuzz test that verifies (for small, reduced inputs) that encoding produces asmap files consistent with their input, that invoking the interpreter on them works as expected, and that decoding and re-encoding does not change their behavior.\r\n\r\nGiven a text file `asmap.txt` with lines like these:\r\n\r\n```\r\n193.189.95.0/24 AS34906\r\n193.189.96.0/24 AS20850\r\n193.189.98.0/23 AS33925\r\n193.190.0.0/15 AS2611\r\n193.19.102.0/23 AS20485\r\n193.19.103.0/24 AS8342\r\n193.19.106.0/23 AS3257\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can run `bitcoin-asmap encode asmap.dat <asmap.txt` to construct an asmap file in a few seconds. `bitcoin-asmap decode asmap.dat` will decode it back to the original format (note however that the result may look very different, as unassigned IP ranges get remapped for efficiency). `bitcoin-asmap lookup asmap.dat 193.190.253.208` will look up one entry in it.\r\n\r\nThere is code at https://github.com/rrybarczyk/asmap-rs (by @rrybarczyk and @naumenkogs) to build input for this tool using RIPE's dumps of Internet routing tables.",
