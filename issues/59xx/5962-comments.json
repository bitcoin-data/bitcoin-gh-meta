So in reality, we'd have to deal with each set of sources (internal convenience libs) separately.\r\n\r\nInstead, something like clang-check that's able to cope with the entire build-system is a much better solution here imo.\r\n\r\nAlso, the resource leak pointed out above looks a real leak.",

But configure then complained that the compiler is unable to create executables, so I actually had to comment out parts of `configure.ac`. Is there a standard way of doing this?",
