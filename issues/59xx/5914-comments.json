The wallet versions are based on CLIENT_VERSIONs. \r\n\r\nClient versions are defined as\r\n```c++\r\nstatic const int CLIENT_VERSION =\r\n                           1000000 * CLIENT_VERSION_MAJOR\r\n                         +   10000 * CLIENT_VERSION_MINOR\r\n                         +     100 * CLIENT_VERSION_REVISION\r\n                         +       1 * CLIENT_VERSION_BUILD;\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at `wallet.h` there are various threshold versions defined based on the first version that introduced them:\r\n```c++\r\nFEATURE_WALLETCRYPT = 40000    # 0.4.0\r\nFEATURE_COMPRPUBKEY = 60000  # 0.6.0\r\nFEATURE_LATEST = 60000    # 0.6.0, this is max(FEATURE_*)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs @theuni says, it makes no sense for FEATURE_LATEST to be higher than the current version. \r\n\r\nIf your altcoin uses an alternative versioning scheme you need to change `FEATURE_*` as well. Or get rid of them completely as it will support all features from the beginning.\r\n\r\n",
