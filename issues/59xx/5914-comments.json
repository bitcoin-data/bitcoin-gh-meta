The wallet versions are based on CLIENT_VERSIONs. \n\nClient versions are defined as\n\n``` c++\nstatic const int CLIENT_VERSION =\n                           1000000 * CLIENT_VERSION_MAJOR\n                         +   10000 * CLIENT_VERSION_MINOR\n                         +     100 * CLIENT_VERSION_REVISION\n                         +       1 * CLIENT_VERSION_BUILD;\n```\n\nLooking at `wallet.h` there are various threshold versions defined based on the first version that introduced them:\n\n``` c++\nFEATURE_WALLETCRYPT = 40000    # 0.4.0\nFEATURE_COMPRPUBKEY = 60000  # 0.6.0\nFEATURE_LATEST = 60000    # 0.6.0, this is max(FEATURE_*)\n```\n\nAs @theuni says, it makes no sense for FEATURE_LATEST to be higher than the current version. \n\nIf your altcoin uses an alternative versioning scheme you need to change `FEATURE_*` as well. Or get rid of them completely as it will support all features from the beginning.\n",
