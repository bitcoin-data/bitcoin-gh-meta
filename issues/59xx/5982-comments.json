      "body" : "For negotiating headers versus inv's, I guess the method that occurs to me is to bump the protocol version number, is that what you had in mind?\n\nIt seems to me that the chief problem to solve is making sure that when we send headers to a peer, they will be accepted -- not rejected because of a missing prior header.  As I understand the code, none of the state we're currently keeping would tell us what headers a given peer has already seen.  The approach I'm working on now would be to start keeping track of the last header we've sent a peer, and combine that with pindexBestKnownBlock (best block that the peer has announced to us) to estimate our peer's best header.  Then, in the places where we currently inv a block, I'd send headers to the peer, the range of which I'd calculate by starting at the block being inv'ed, and walking back until I either get to the last header I've sent that peer (pindexLastHeaderSent), or pindexBestKnownBlock, or an ancestor of either (ie in the event of a reorg).\n\nAnd I was also thinking that in the event that either pindexBestKnownBlock & pindexLastHeaderSent are both NULL or that the above algorithm would generate a too-long headers chain (not sure what value to use here, maybe only be willing to send up to 8 or 16 headers or something?), I'd revert to just sending an inv, and letting the peer figure out what to do.  If we let that value be too large, then a node doing initial block download would be inundated with headers from all its peers if a block is announced during the download, which seems undesirable.  On the other hand, I want it to not be so small as to be useless during a reorg.\n\nAny thoughts on this approach?\n",

In either case, this probably requires a small BIP (like BIP 35 or BIP 61).\n\nI was just thinking about relaying whatever new block index entries become part of _our_ new best block chain (see the code touched by #5307, but send a headers message rather than an inv). Assuming peers actively try to synchronize with us, typically just sending our new best chain entries should suffice to let them keep up.\n\nTrying to figure out which headers they already have may help of course, but we should avoid trying to push headers to a node that is still in initial sync mode, as that would just slow them down.\n\nAlso, there is currently no infrastructure for avoiding duplication in headers announcement (while there is for inv messages). Perhaps the inv code should be reused/generalized. This may not be necessary if the handling logic is good enough to keep track of which headers a peer has.\n",

      "body" : "@sipa Thanks -- that \"random idea\" was actually pretty important, I overlooked it initially.\n\nI believe I have a working implementation of this (it's still a work in progress but you can see it here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/11a8da32f62c69402235c7231e6deb60660c9eea -- I introduced a new \"sendheaders\" p2p message which requests that a peer announce blocks with headers rather than invs).\n\nI ran into one issue I wanted some advice on; it seems to me that we wouldn't necessarily want to initiate headers-announcements with all our peers, because if a node has a lot of connections, the additional overhead from sending headers will at some point exceed the savings from eliminating getheaders messages (I think at around 15 or 16 peers).\n\nOne option to address this could be to limit requesting headers announcements to, say, just our outbound peers, which would be a simple way of ensuring we haven't added any overhead.  But that's not really optimal at all, as I think what we're really interested in is having the peers that we're most likely to send a getdata be the ones that announce blocks with headers, which may or may not be our outbound peers.\n\nAn alternative idea would be to track peer getdata requests, so that if a peer's requests are below some threshold (maybe something like, they've requested less than 4 blocks from us out of the last 64), we revert to sending them inv's rather than headers, even if they have requested headers announcements. But before I go down this road too far I wanted to see if this is a reasonable direction to go at all?\n",
