Remember that there are various filtering steps that reduce the size of the list, for example to remove addresses already known, so starting off with 1000 entries may result in much less than 1000 being returned.\n",

Maybe this request can be closed, maybe I'll send another one just replacing some of the hardcoded \"1000\" number with `MAX_ADDR_TO_SEND` constant.\n\nDoes anyone have thoughts on the issue of the possibility that initial `addr`-messages get overwritten in the queue by `PushAddress()` and therefore never get sent?\n",
