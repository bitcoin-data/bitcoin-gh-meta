   "body" : "Threads have noticeable overhead on 32-bit systems, so using fewer threads for simple tasks is better than starting up threads willy-nilly.\n\nThe first commit implements a simple task queue class (CScheduler) which can be serviced by one or more threads.\n\nThe second and third port the networking code's DumpAddresses thread to be a task instead.\n\nPorting other threads (ThreadFlushWalletDB is a good candidate) is left as an exercise for future pull requests.\n\nThe CScheduler class was developed and tested with code here: https://github.com/gavinandresen/scheduler  (see main.cpp)\n\nI tested the DumpAddresses change running with -debug=net and a hacked DEBUG_ADDRESS_INTERVAL, and made sure  I got more than one \"Flushed %d addresses to peers.dat\" in my debug.log.\n",
