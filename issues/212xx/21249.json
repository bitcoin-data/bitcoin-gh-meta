   "body" : "_What?_\r\n\r\nAdd Bitcoin Whitepaper in Docs\r\n\r\n_Why?_\r\n\r\nThe link to Whitepaper is [removed from readme.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21210/) and Whitepaper should be part of Docs in this repository. Scammers should not be able to decide what can be removed from Bitcoin Core project. I think enough people and organizations have shown support after removal of whitepaper from Bitcoin Core website. Not all Bitcoin Core contributors or users were okay with the removal of whitepaper from website however a link to whitepaper or whitepaper itself needs to exist in this project.\r\n\r\n_How?_\r\n\r\nI created a directory for whitepaper in doc which can also be used to add images if necessary. Whitepaper can also be written in a better way or improved because I am not the best with markdown.\r\n\r\nAlternatives: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21210/commits/77772a1b809e443a6861ee49009ff8bc55cff9c3#r577978996\r\n\r\nBitcoin Knots still has a link to whitepaper available on https://bitcoin.org : https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin/blob/0.21.x-knots/README.md\r\n\r\nOther things: Some people may not be okay with sharing links related to https://bitcoin.org because of controversial people involved in managing the website so whitepaper can be written in a markdown file and added to docs. I removed `www.bitcoin.org` written below Satoshi's email address but I am not sure about this change. Also Line 46 in `guiconstants.h` https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/828bb776d29cbdfad3937ba100c428e3244c652f/src/qt/guiconstants.h#L46 has this domain and most probably it will remain being the origin domain.",
