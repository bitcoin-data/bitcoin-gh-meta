When I ran it, I got one error.  I have not found an explanation anywhere of what the error means, but my best guess is consistent with the result, so I propose the explanatory comment to save others time when they use it and also get the error.  A better fix is for tc NOT to report the failure to delete a qdisc when it's a result of there being no such qdisc.  I'll go look for a tc maintainer now to see if it can be changed to a warning.",
