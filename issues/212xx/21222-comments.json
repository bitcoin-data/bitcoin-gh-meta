Though, I overheard several devs (over the years) complain about this particular `ERROR` that happens on a normal and expected condition. Moreover, three reviewers left a comment in the other PR that it should be fixed for all 3 instances of the same issue (not just one). There is already a huge code churn in the repo and tracing back when a change has been made originally becomes a time-consuming task. While `git log -S` can deal perfectly fine with move-only, it will abort on every other change. So I think we shouldn't be aiming to make a change, knowing that it will be reverted soon in favour of a broader change.\r\n\r\n> ... the most active maintainer and the most active committer since years and it seems pointless to leave it open if you open a competing patch.\r\n\r\nI think it would be very alarming if any patch (or review) is simply preferred based on the number of commits or comments a contributor has made. In the (far) past, horrible consensus failures have been introduced by (presumably) relying on that metric. My impression is that code review and quality assurance have improved significantly since then. I can point to many high-impact bugs introduced in the last three months by \"top-10\" or \"top-20\" contributors by commit count and all of them have been caught by code review. I think when evaluating changes to Bitcoin (Core) we should purely take into account how much sense they make and not the reputation of the person voicing them.",
