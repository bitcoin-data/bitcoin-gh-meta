   "body" : "If Boost is not found via AX_BOOST_BASE, we don't actually stop\r\nconfiguring, only a warning is emitted:\r\n```bash\r\nchecking for boostlib >= 1.58.0 (105800)... configure: We could not detect the boost libraries (version MINIMUM_REQUIRED_BOOST or higher). If you have a staged boost library (still not installed) please specify $BOOST_ROOT in your environment and do not give a PATH to --with-boost option.  If you are sure you have boost installed, then check your version number looking in <boost/version.hpp>. See http://randspringer.de/boost for more documentation.\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead we usually fail when one of the other AX_BOOST_* macros fails to find a library. These macros are slowly being\r\nremoved, and in any case, it makes more sense to fail earlier if Boost is missing.\r\n\r\nIf Boost is unavailable, the failure now looks like:\r\n```bash\r\nchecking for boostlib >= 1.58.0 (105800)... configure: We could not detect the boost libraries (version 1.58.0 or higher). If you have a staged boost library (still not installed) please specify $BOOST_ROOT in your environment and do not give a PATH to --with-boost option.  If you are sure you have boost installed, then check your version number looking in <boost/version.hpp>. See http://randspringer.de/boost for more documentation.\r\nconfigure: error: Boost is not available!\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that we now just pass the version into AX_BOOST_BASE, which fixes it's display in the output (rather than showing `MINIMUM_REQUIRED_BOOST`).\r\n\r\nThis PR also has a commit that adds `libboost-dev` to our install instructions and CI. This package is currently installed as a side-effect of installing our other libboost-*-dev packages. However as those continue to disappear, it makes sense to install boost-dev explicitly.",
