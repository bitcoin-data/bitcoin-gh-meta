It makes it harder to verify a particular version after the fact because then you involve git and having to find the commit in the git history. Not to mention the fact that occasionally, the hashes file can change if someone does a rebuild (e.g. after clearing caches). I like the current method of a hashes file and then `.sig` of that file. It would just be a `SHA256SUMS.sig` in addition to the `SHA256SUMS`.",
