We\ncan then use github as a backup to sourceforge, or vice versa. If the files\nare different, then we have to choose between the two. Sourceforge is\nfaster and way more reliable, with their endless array of mirrors.\n\nMind you, I am torn on this one - not having the github hash in the\ndirectory makes things a lot simpler where I am concerned - although most\nof that complexity is managed by someone else.\n\nOn 30 June 2013 22:15, Pieter Wuille notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Ok, I've moved the construction of the tar file inside gitian, so\n> hopefully it is deterministic now.\n> \n> A few notes:\n> - Currently, the gitian build script doesn't know the \"name\" of the\n>   version being built, so the tarball uses a subdir bitcoin/ rather than\n>   bitcoin-$VERSION/; I don't know how much that is uncommon/unexpected.\n> - I've put it inside the Windows build, as I didn't want to create a\n>   full separate gitian build for just the source, and the Linux build gets\n>   run twice (32-bit, 64-bit) so it would be double work and the result would\n>   perhaps depend on the order in which you run the builds.\n> \n> â\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2804#issuecomment-20246227\n> .\n",
