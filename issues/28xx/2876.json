If there were transactions in the mempool already that depended one or more of those, they become orphan transactions - which breaks the mempool's consistency assumption.\n\nIn addition, this pull request adds a CTxMempool::check() method which runs an extensive consistency check on the mempool, and is called from several places when -checkmempool is passed (a non-documented flag).\n",
