      "body" : "Two comments:\n- Shared locks are not recursive, so if any of these wallet callbacks causes a call to main, which causes a new callback, you have a deadlock. I don't believe such cases occur, but it's worth making a comment about it in the code.\n- There is still a potential deadlock when callbacks are combined with modifications to setpwalletRegistered. This is not a problem for now, as such modifications only happen at startup, but we need to think about this before fully-fledged multiwallet is added. In general, it will probably mean that RPC calls cannot gratuitously lock the wallet anymore - only those that need access to a wallet, and only the one the need. In particular, anything modifying the set of registered wallets will need a lock on setpwalletRegistered without locking any of the wallets in it.\n\nACK though.\n",
