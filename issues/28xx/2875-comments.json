      "body" : "NACK.\n\nFirst: Berkeley DB doesn't give any guarantees that removing a key/value pair will actually remove it from either the .dat file, the journal file(s), or the hard disk. I don't want to repeat the wallet encryption fiasco we went through, where private keys remained on disk unexpectedly.\n\nSecond: I believe the tentative plan for a future wallet format is an append-only format, because append-only tends to be more reliable than read/write. Erase private key breaks the append-only property.\n\nAnd finally: we don't remove private keys because we don't want to make it any easier for users to lose bitcoins. If you REALLY want to remove private keys from your wallet, I think shutting down bitcoind and using a tool like pywallet is the right way to do it, because only the most tech-savvy users will do that.\n",
