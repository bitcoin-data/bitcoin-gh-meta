   "body" : "This is a rebased version of a patch that mining.bitcoin.cz used during the march 11 2013 hardfork, to be able to continue using 0.8 while still mining the 0.7 chain.\n\nThe reason for submitting it to mainline is:\n- When implementing this, I found that there were a few edge-cases in the reorganization handling, which are fixed here. They probably won't ever occur in normal operation, but I prefer the code to be robust.\n- For emergencies, having a blacklistblock RPC is certainly useful to have in the code, though I prefer not having it in normal releases. It's only enabled when compiling with ENABLE_BLOCK_BLACKLISTING. The RPC code is always compiled, so we can catch refactorings that would break it, though - just the index entry is not present normally.\n",
