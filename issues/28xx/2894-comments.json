I probably pulled it in when restoring a wallet backup during the upgrade to 0.8.3\n(which seems plausible, as the file time on the conf was from april 2013)\n\n> Now I'm just wishing I had realized how great the gap was between the bootstrap.dat torrent and block 252138\n> ... client is still chewing on bootstrap.dat / 7.82 GB (8,402,191,958 bytes) / \"Importing blocks from disk\"\n",
