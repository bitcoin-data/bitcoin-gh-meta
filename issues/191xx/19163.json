I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\r\n\r\nBitcoins currently have no intrinsic value. This sucks.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\n\r\nBitcoins should be redeemable on the network itself to buy compute cycles from miners, and miners should be able to run arbitrary compute tasks for users to earn their Bitcoin instead of mindlessly computing hashes.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\nI've considered that other coins might be easier to develop a system like this for, but I thought I would feature-request it to Bitcoin first.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n\r\nIf Bitcoins had intrinsic value, backed by the compute resources available on the entire Bitcoin network, they could really compete with fiat currency. Almost everyone has a compute task they'd love to buy cycles for.",
