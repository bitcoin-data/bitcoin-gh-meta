   "body" : "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR adds basic process spawning and IPC method call support to `bitcoin-node` executables built with `--enable-multiprocess`[*].\r\n\r\nThese changes are used in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102 to let node, gui, and wallet functionality run in different processes, and extended in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19460 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461 after that to allow gui and wallet processes to be started and stopped independently and connect to the node over a socket.\r\n\r\nThese changes can also be used to implement new functionality outside the `bitcoin-node` process like external indexes or pluggable transports (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18988). The `Ipc::spawnProcess` and `Ipc::serveProcess` methods added here are entry points for spawning a child process and serving a parent process, and being able to make bidirectional, multithreaded method calls between the processes. A simple example of this is implemented in commit \"Add echoipc RPC method and test.\"\r\n\r\nChanges in this PR aside from the echo test were originally part of #10102, but have been split and moved here for easier review, and so they can be used for other applications like external plugins.\r\n\r\nAdditional notes about this PR can be found at https://bitcoincore.reviews/19160\r\n\r\n[*] Note: the `--enable-multiprocess` feature is still experimental, and not enabled by default, and not yet supported on windows. More information can be found in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)",
