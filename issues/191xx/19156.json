I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\r\nFirstly it's not really an issue of Bitcoin Core only, it's about the entire bitcoin ecosystem :-)\r\n\r\nI don't really know the historical context. I have learned that displaying P2PK/P2MS as 1-starting P2PKH address is criticized as \"non-standard\" or \"incorrect\" etc, so that some block explorers like Blockstream.info have refused to display these bare-pubkey (previous) transaction outputs as 1-starting P2PKH addresses.\r\n\r\nIMHO this only creates confusion, that even the famous Satoshi genesis address cannot be clearly displayed.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\nI think it's really reasonable to make a compromise, to make matching P2PK/P2MS with 1-starting P2PKH address possible.\r\n\r\nThe confusion/ambiguity between P2PKH and P2PK/P2MS has already been there. I agree that ambiguity is not good, but mentions/referrings (in the old historical posts/writtings etc) of those 1-starting addresses simply can't be eradicated :-( Therefore a compromise might be actually necessary.\r\n\r\nHowever, I agree that the distinction between P2PKH and P2PK/P2MS should always be taken good care of, by means of displaying notes (on the web-based block explorer) and extending the functions of [output descriptors](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md).\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\nHonestly I don't know... \"keep the status quo\", probably? :-)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nhttps://github.com/Blockstream/esplora/issues/14\r\nhttps://btc.com/581d30e2a73a2db683ac2f15d53590bd0cd72de52555c2722d9d6a78e9fea510\r\nhttps://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/0\r\nhttps://btc.com/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f\r\nhttps://blockstream.info/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f",
