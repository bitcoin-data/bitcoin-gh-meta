With descriptor wallets it's probably more doable to add a new seed storage mechanism.\r\n\r\nI do think there's a use case for migrating funds from a mnemonic backup to a Bitcoin Core wallet (with or without a sweep). BIP39 mnemonics are abundant and there's probably plenty of people who no longer have - or trust - the original wallet that generated it. Right now the only practical way to do that is to import the mnemonic in an arbitrary other (hardware) wallet and then send the coins.\r\n\r\nBut it's a non trivial change.  Perhaps it's better left to when we have an additional use case for a different seed storage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat still leaves the possibility of a watch-only import. Arguably this is dangerous and users should instead import an account level xpub if they need a watch-only wallet.\r\n\r\nAs far hashing, we do have `HMAC-SHA-512`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/crypto/hmac_sha512.h\r\n\r\nAssuming this earlier attempt by @mateusz is correct, implementing PBKDF2 pretty short: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20361/commits/7e6ba0a3278ff0938c617a234ff07be8a20b06ed#diff-72f3c3f065865085863d0a6577e18effa07a22f3fc2df6e77b5f7089159bc031",
