I tested a couple of transactions with empty OP_RETURN (that is, assuming that the template could be exempted for the relaying policy), and the numbers I got from `decoderawtransaction` was:\r\n\r\n1 native segwit UTXO: size=171, vsize=89, weight=354\r\n2 native segwit UTXOs: size=319, vsize=157, weight=625\r\n\r\nSo each UTXO would add ~148 bytes or ~271 weight, meaning the overhead of burning/donating/whatever the UTXOs individually would be ~23 bytes or ~83 weight per UTXO - unless there's something wrong with my math or TX serialization understanding, of course.",
