   "body" : "PayJoin (also called pay-to-end-point or P2EP) is a special type of CoinJoin between two parties where one party pays the other. This coinjoin type has different (probably better) privacy properties. The transaction then doesn't have the distinctive multiple outputs with the same value, and so is not obviously visible as an equal-output CoinJoin. \r\n\r\nAn overview of PayJoin with additional information and links can be found here https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/PayJoin\r\n\r\nImplementing PayJoin would potentially need OpenSSL to communicate with the PayJoin server (unless I am misunderstanding how PayJoin works) as such, implementing this would have similar objections to BIP 70.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing thoughts.",
