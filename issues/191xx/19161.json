   "body" : "Bitcoin Core offers sovereignty by people controlling their keys and validating those keys. But many users today hold their keys on hardware wallets or mobile wallets and it's a bit difficult to connect those wallets to a full node and validate them. \r\n\r\nThe cli users have the option to \"getrawtransaction _txid_ true\" in order to find valuable information about a transaction that could be theirs. This is a very powerful api call that effectively eliminates the need of an Electrum server.\r\n\r\nI think many users would find a lot of value in easily verifying their personal transaction directly from Bitcoin Core GUI! \r\n\r\nSomething like Help -> Verify external txid. There would need to be an option to enable txindex also. This would greatly increase the use of Bitcoin Core for the ease of validating a transaction. Sure users could create a watch only wallet but these are extra steps that maybe many of the non technical users would get discouraged from doing.",
