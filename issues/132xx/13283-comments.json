You can't just say \"bitcoin uses weight now, not bytes\"; You have\nto know *both*.  For example, both lightning and GreenAddress were\nbroken by the \"vbytes for fee calculation\" rule; fortunately they\nmentioned it to me so I could figure out WTF was going on w/ lightning.\n\nRegarding APIs generally:\n\n1. Adding \"vbytes\" fields was contaminated thinking, but it's too late\n   now.\n2. I agree that such a change would be invasive and hard; in particular\n   care would be needed that these rules got looser, not tighter, and other\n   nodes wouldn't start banning new nodes who fwd txs they consider\n   nonstandard, and I'm sure other things I haven't thought of.\n3. minRelayTxFee, dust logic, transaction replacement and IsStandard()\n   are APIs which upper layers (like lightning) need to know; though I\n   hate that.  They should be as clear as possible and not changed\n   without broad consultation; certainly not tightened.\n\nSince I consider stuff-on-top-of-Bitcoin to be at an early phase, I\nconsider simplifying these APIs to be important to avoid contaminating\neverything up-stack with legacy.\n\n",
