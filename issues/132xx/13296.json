Even when 'Hide tray icon' is unselected.\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\nWhen minimizing or closing the Bitcoin Core Wallet window, it should show up in the system tray.\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\nThe Bitcoin Core Wallet window disappears, does not get shown in the tray, and with no way of maximizing or utilizing it\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\nMinimize or close Bitcoin Core Wallet window while the following options are selected:\r\n- 'Minimize to the tray instead of the taskbar'\r\n- 'Minimize on close'\r\n\r\nand this one unselected:\r\n- 'Hide tray icon'\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nv0.16.0. https://bitcoin.org/nl/download. Linux 64 bit.\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nOS: Linux Mint 18.3 Sylvia (Xfce) (Compiz as window manager)\r\nCPU: Intel i7 3820\r\nDisk: WD Caviar GP WD20000CSRTL2, 2TB\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
