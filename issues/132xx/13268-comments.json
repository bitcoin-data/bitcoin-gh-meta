Yes, maybe  `std::logic_error` isn't designed to caught by normal program code, and can thus be treated similarly to an assertion failure - but that's not the case in our code. We have 54 `catch (const std::exception& e)` cases in our codebase, some of which will happily continue after catching an out of bounds error.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should work on making those catch statements be more specific and guarantee they can't catch `std::logic_error`s? Without that, I'm very scared about replacing asserts with exceptions.",
