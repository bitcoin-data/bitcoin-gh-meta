      "body" : "> a transaction that the wallet received during the offline period was seen in a block, and the transactions tab in the QT ui showed the transaction. However the transactions was not shown as \"confirmed\" but instead \"open\"\r\n\r\nI assume the transaction has a lock time specified as block height. Thus, when receiving the transaction through a block, its lock time must be that block's height or less. My understanding is that only a reorg that excludes this tx could display the transaction as \"open\", since other interfaces (rpc/p2p) reject such \"open\" transactions with `non-final (code 64)`. (Also, unrelated to this issue report, the Bitcoin Core wallet wouldn't create \"open\" transactions, c.f. `assert(txNew.nLockTime <= (unsigned int)chainActive.Height());` in wallet.cpp)\r\n\r\nI suggest to check if `getchaintips` shows any valid forks just to rule out the possibility of a reorg. (Just noting that a 130 block reorg that went unnoticed seems very unlikely to me)\r\n\r\n> Eventually the icon switched directly to a check-mark, and a mouse-over showed the number of confirmations. However, the number of confirmations is too low by about 30 (a bit of a guess as I get tx details and then check the block height the UI reports it's synced to).\r\n\r\nI suggest to check if `gettransaction $txid` shows the same number of confirmations as the gui and if the time is different from the blocktime and timereceived. Further gettransaction returns you a hex, which you can put into `decoderawtransaction` to compare the locktime against the other times.",

Looking at debug.log I see only the normal `AddToWallet $txid new` message.\r\n\r\nThis tx was around height 522030, and I don't think there were any reorgs around then; the node displaying the UI bug was directly connected to another node on a server I control which was synced up, so I'm quite sure there were no reorgs or anything strange being sent to the QT node.\r\n\r\nI think it's a QT UI only bug as I haven't seen anything weird in the CLI output or log files. Even during sync when I checked with `gettransaction` in the QT console it looked fine, and showed confirmations.",
