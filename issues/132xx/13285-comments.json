This certainly solves the main issue I'm interested in, which is the manual ordering in the list.\r\n\r\nI currently don't have time (nor do I want to step on your toes here) to implement the full set of metadata mentioned in #11964, though.  So I would only include the rough runtime in the tests to make the order automatic (i. e., the order in `test_runner.py` itself won't matter and can be based on logical relation of tests rather than runtime).  I would not implement the full set of metadata to get rid of the list completely for now.

However, as far as I can see your comment relates only to point 1) of my original report.  I believe that point 2) is actually the important part (perhaps that was not made very clear):  **I want to get rid of the requirement to have tests in order in the code, at least roughly.**  Instead, the code should be mainly written for us developers, and should be in an order that makes sense from a logical point of view.\r\n\r\nSo if you (and others) believe that solving point 1) in addition is not worth the complication of the auto-generated list, my proposal is to solve just point 2) by manually including (approximate) test runtimes somewhere - for instance, by a limited implementation of metadata in tests as suggested by #11964 (where the metadata is for now just the test runtime, so that `test_runners.py` can sort on the fly before running the tests).  What do you think about this proposal?",

Also, having metadata in the tests themselves seems to be what we are going to anyway with #11964 at some point in the future.\r\n\r\nAlso, again, my goal is not to reduce the maintenance overhead of keeping the current list sorted.  I want to get rid of the constraint that it has to be sorted, and thus allow reordering it in a more readable and logical way.  That's what I want to solve here - if you think this is a non-goal (I disagree, for readability reasons of the code), then of course this proposal is not useful.",

      "body" : "Let me perhaps explain how I came to this idea:  I'm the core maintainer of Namecoin, which is based on Bitcoin Core and tries to follow the upstream development as closely as possible.  We do have our own set of regression tests, in addition to the ones Bitcoin has.  I most certainly want to have all of them in a single block in `test_runner.py`, currently at the end (definitely not mixed into the Bitcoin tests, for various reasons from merge conflicts to clarity in reading the code).  This means that the tests take longer than they need to, because our longer running tests are not parallelised well.\r\n\r\nOf course, that's by itself not a valid reason to change anything in Bitcoin.  First, that's Namecoin's problem and not Bitcoin's.  And second, we can solve the issue quite easily by moving the block of tests to the beginning rather than end of the test list.\r\n\r\nHowever, since in my opinion it clearly makes sense to have the \"name-related\" tests in Namecoin in their own block rather than mixed into all other tests, I assume that the same argument can be made also for Bitcoin's tests.  I'm not strictly thinking about a lexicographical order; perhaps having all \"segwit-related\" tests next to each other would make sense, or all P2P tests (the latter is close to lexicographic ordering now with the naming convention).\r\n\r\nBut if you disagree and don't see value in doing this for Bitcoin, I can understand that we should not introduce more complexity \"for nothing\" - then I'm perfectly happy to close this issue as \"won't fix\", and just put Namecoin's tests at the beginning of the list.  But ideally I would like to know before coding it up whether or not such a change would be accepted (not considering the actual code quality for now, of course).",
