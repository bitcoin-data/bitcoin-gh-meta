However the transactions was not shown as \"confirmed\" but instead \"open\".  Also, the number of confirmations seems to be incorrect.\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n\r\nI expected the clock icon that fills in as it downloads more blocks, followed by a check mark once it sees 6 confirmations.\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\nInstead there was no icon, and a mouse-over showed \"open for next 130 blocks\".  This confused me as the transaction wasn't a coinbase tx, didn't use op_csv or anything like that.  The transaction did have a locktime, but the bitcoind wallet has been setting that for a while.\r\n\r\nEventually the icon switched directly to a check-mark, and a mouse-over showed the number of confirmations.  However, the number of confirmations is too low by about 30 (a bit of a guess as I get tx details and then check the block height the UI reports it's synced to).\r\n\r\nThe receiving address was a bech32 native segwit v0 address, which may be related.  I asked @theuni and he pointed out code around here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/048ac8326b6952244f6e4453f4f8f6ab423eb926/src/qt/transactionrecord.cpp#L177 \r\nwhich looks related; the ui may not be updating finality properly.\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nsystem:\r\n0.16.0, linux, downloaded from bitcoincore.org, checked gpg sig.\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\nUbuntu 16.04, laptop hard drive.\r\n\r\nThis is not a huge issue but I think it could be confusing to users as it indicates that the transaction is not confirmed even though it really is.  The UI eventually displays confirmed though.\r\n",
