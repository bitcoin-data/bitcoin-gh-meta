      "body" : "Thanks @jonasschnelli for elaborating. I agree with you that creating a new seed is not the same as creating a new wallet. But the GUI texts during encryption process had me thinking \"What!!! Does it really just encrypt the seed already written to disk???\", so I had to dig deeper and search through GitHub etc to figure out what Bitcoin Core actually does before I could feel comfortable with the process. So I do think there's a problem with the GUI. \r\n\r\nI think it's right to communicate on the \"wallet\" context-level, rather than \"seed\" level. How about this instead:\r\n\r\n1. Select File --> Encrypt wallet... (As in 0.16.0)\r\n2. The \"Encrypt wallet\" dialog should explain what happens during encryption. Either as a button, eg \"Explain this...\", or directly in the dialog\r\n3. \"Confirm wallet encryption\" (As in 0.16.0)\r\n4. The \"Wallet encrypted\" info dialog should have a clearer IMPORTANT: text. Otherwise as in 0.16.0.\r\n\r\nSuggested explainer text:\r\n\r\n\"When the wallet file is encrypted, your old seed (random data that is used to generate addresses) will be preserved, but deprecated for security reasons. A new seed is generated that all future addresses are derived from.\"\r\n\r\nSuggested IMPORTANT text:\r\n\r\n\"IMPORTANT: Any previous backups you have made of your wallet file should be replaced with the newly generated, encrypted wallet file. For security reasons, previous backups of the unencrypted wallet file will become obsolete as soon as you start using the encrypted wallet. Please make sure you backup your newly encrypted wallet file before using it.\"",

Something like this.\r\n\r\nIn general, I think it should tell users that encrypting a wallet after creations and __especially__ after addresses has been used is generally a bad thing. Without being to specific about internals (like \"seed\", etc.)\r\nWe could warn more bold if the wallet has used addresses.\r\n\r\nBut, since encryption during creation is not yet possible (soon, `createwallet` RPC is now merged), I think the function of crypting later should stay (probably also once there is a function to encrypt during creation).",
