   "body" : "This PR adds missing unit test coverage for the Python ECDSA implementation, which should be useful for detecting potential problems early whenever changes in the test framework's Python implementation of secp256k1 are made (e.g. #26222). Note that right now we don't call `ECPubKey.verify_ecdsa` anywhere in our tests, so we wouldn't notice if it is broken at some point.\r\n\r\nTo keep it simple, the already existing unit test for Schnorr signatures is extended to also check ECDSA signatures. For that purpose, the dictionary storing private-key/public-key entries use their legacy types `ECKey/ECPubKey` instead of bare byte-arrays, and for Schnorr signing/verification the necessary conversions (ECKey -> bare private key, ECPubKey -> x-only pubkey) is done later when needed. To avoid code duplication, a helper function `random_bitflip` for damaging signatures is introduced.",
