   "body" : "The functional test feature_taproot.py fails in some rare cases on the execution of the following `\"branched_codesep\"` spending script (can be reproduced via `$ ./test/functional/feature_taproot.py --randomseed 9048710178866422833` on master / 137a98c5a22e058ed7a7997a0a4dbd75301de51e):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9d85c03620bf660cfa7d13080f5c0b191579cbc3/test/functional/feature_taproot.py#L741\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs if the first data-push (having random content with a random length in the range [0, 510]) has a length of 1 and the single byte has value of [1...16] or [-1]; in this case, the data-push is not minimally encoded by test framework's CScript class (i.e. doesn't use the special op-codes OP_1...OP_16 or OP_1NEGATE) and the script interpreter throws an SCRIPT_ERR_MINIMALDATA error:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest_framework.authproxy.JSONRPCException: non-mandatory-script-verify-flag (Data push larger than necessary) (-26)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBackground: the functional test framework's CScript class translates passed bytes/bytearrays always to data pushes using OP_PUSHx/OP_PUSHDATA{1,2,4} op-codes (see `CScript.__coerce_instance(...)`). E.g. the expression `CScript(bytes([1]))` yields `bytes([OP_PUSH1, 1])` instead of the minimal-encoded `bytes([OP_1])`.\r\n\r\nFix this by adapting the random-size range to [2,...], i.e. never pass byte-arrays below length two to be pushed.\r\n\r\nCloses #27595.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",
