We found that when the Bitcoin wallet node processes the process message recently, the single-threaded CPU 100% causes block parsing delays, resulting in serious technical failures.\r\nOur version number is the latest version 24.0.1ã\r\nNot only antpool, we also asked other mining pools and found this problem. This will lead to increasingly serious orphan blocks and forks.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nRun ProcessMessage with multiple threads to reduce the performance problem of CPU single-thread ProcessMessage.\r\nOr are there other configurations that can alleviate this problem?\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRun the wallet, synchronize to the latest height, and then observe the CPU usage. You can see that there is a single-core CPU usage that remains at 100% for a long time\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPre-built binaries\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv24.0.1\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nUbuntu 22.04 LTC\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
