You'd also want to fuzz the logic that uses fPauseRecv (i.e. `CConnman::SocketHandler`).\r\n\r\n> it's ok for me to close it for now and add recv_flood_size and prefer_evict alongside with more appropriate net targets.\r\n\r\nThat would be better. Fwiw we already have a target for fuzzing the eviction logic in isolation called `node_eviction`, so `prefer_evict` is probably less interesting.",
