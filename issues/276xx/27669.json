   "body" : "Currently `dumptxoutset` uses `hash_serialized_2` for its `txoutset_hash`. The proposed `loadtxoutset` (#27596) then checks this against the hash we hardcode in `CChainParams`.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the only way to check this hash, if you're not using it yourself, is to rollback the chain to the assume-utxo snapshot height, call the (slow) `gettxoutsetinfo` and then replay to the tip. This process is slow and potentially wreaks havoc on your lightning node if you forget to shut it down first.\r\n\r\nIf we used the MuHash instead then any user with `-coinstatsindex` can verify it with a simple `gettxoutsetinfo muhash HEIGHT`.\r\n\r\nFor good measure we should also modify `gettxoutsetinfo` so it can calculate the muhash for the current UTXO set without relying on the index. This would help users with pruned nodes (and without the index) to verify a newly proposed snapshot (if they haven't pruned beyond it).\r\n\r\nI think this can be changed after #27596 is merged. It would just require offering two snapshots for download for a while.",
