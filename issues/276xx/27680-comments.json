I added the BDB as I might need to access legacy wallets, for RasPi OS I had to add the `--build=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu ` to the `./configure` command before building the DB.\r\n\r\nFor a noob like me it's important to know that the ./autogen.sh script and configure command are run after all dependencies have been installed. When I first looked at the readme it seemed if that should be done first.\r\nAlso I didn't quite understand the note and how to specify the absolute path to the dependencies (seemed I didn't need to anyhow), maybe adding another example how a specific absolute paths looks for a specific dependency would help.\r\n\r\nThanks for listening and helping out!",
