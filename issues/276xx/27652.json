But it would be much easier if it allowed you to use ANY peer.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you run a pruned node, and your first peer happens to be also pruned, the call will fail. If the call tried all nodes, until it finds a peer that has the block, it wouldn't require you that implement any logic for that.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe solution would be simple: if you don't specify any index, then try all peers untill you find one that does have block, otherwise fail.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
