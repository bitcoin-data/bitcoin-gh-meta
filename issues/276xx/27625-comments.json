I was about to suggest that in that case it seems sufficient to only put `BLOCK` (maybe also `CONFLICTED`/`REORG`) transactions into `mapRelay` (keeping their mempool timestamp, to avoid adding ones that are older than 15 minutes). However, I think your point also applies to `REPLACED` transactions, because we'd still want to relay them, so that they are rejected by the peer and end up in their `AddToCompactExtraTransactions`? I wonder if it makes sense to drop a line or two of documentation here. (Edit: Or maybe even a test, if we want to get extra fancy)",

And if you use separate and dedicated size limits for `mapRelay` and the mempool, it might be easier to keep them separate data structures? ",

And if you use separate and dedicated size limits for `mapRelay` and the mempool, it might be easier to keep them separate data structures?\r\n\r\nThe memory usage of `mapRelay` depends on whether the transactions in it have been removed from the mempool -- if you've got 15k txs in `mapRelay` but all of them are in the mempool, then that's likely using up ~1MB; but if 50% of them were removed from the mempool and each `CTransactionRef` is using up 1kB, then that's more an extra ~15MB. You maybe get the latter scenario if you're relaying a lot of RBF txs. So I don't think you can sensibly put a figure on how much memory `mapRelay` is using if you don't track the relationship.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, the advantage of linking the two together for limits is that if you start trimming the mempool because `mapRelay` is too large, then you're increasing the mempool minfee, which reduces the RBF headroom -- instead of being able to RBF 50 times from 10 sat/vb up to 60 sat/vb, you might only see and relay 40 RBFs, from 20 sat/vb up to 60 sat/vb, which then reduces pressure on `mapRelay`.\r\n\r\n> What is the benefit of `mapRelay` overlapping with mempool?\r\n\r\n(a) We want things to expire from `mapRelay` based on when we first announced them, not when we first received them or when we evicted them, so that's extra data to store.\r\n\r\n(b) The number of txs we announce in 15 minutes is (currently) relatively tightly constrained (35tx every 2s for outbounds over 15min is ~16k; chance of >20k in 15min is about 1-in-5M).\r\n\r\n> If the main reason is transactions that could be in blocks, it seems reasonable to cap it at just a few thousand entries?\r\n\r\nWith RBF, you could have many different variants of a single tx, each relatively likely to make it into a block depending on when the miner picked the block template, so I think the time-based cap makes sense.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't think there's a strong reason for the expiry duration to be 15 minutes rather than something shorter -- that was just left unchanged in #16851 when `mapRelay` went from being the only way to find a tx to just being the way to get at txs that are new to the mempool.",

It's been a while since I thought about this and I haven't fully dug through the code again to refresh my memory, but my recollection is that one of the main reasons we had to keep mapRelay in the past was that historically, our software wouldn't deal with NOTFOUND responses to a getdata very well, and so if we announced a transaction and then dropped it (for whatever reason) we would be mildly DoS'ing our peers (I think we used to wait 2 minutes before trying the next peer who had announced it to us).\r\n\r\nNow that we handle NOTFOUND's better, I think the last reason to hang on to mapRelay is the reason I gave above -- if the transaction was just removed in a block, we should provide it.  However, we can do that by just looking at the last block we received, which I believe we store in memory for fast compact block replies (`m_most_recent_block`).  So if we just built an index into that last block, then I think we would be clear to drop mapRelay altogether.",

That got further tweaked in #18861 so that we'd skip txs that were in the to-be-announced queue, and then got tweaked further in #19109 so that the mempool would be used unconditionally for txs that had been announced recently, or that were older than 2 minutes, and `mapRelay` would only be used for txs that had left the mempool, had been announced recently (with the last 3500-5250 txs), and had entered the mempool within the last 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nThis resurrects #17303, and it's probably worth reviewing the comments there; most of the issues they raise have already been addressed, I think.\r\n\r\nI think I agree with [Suhas's comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27625#issuecomment-1544047433) that we should ensure we serve any txs in the most recent block before dropping `mapRelay` though, so only a concept ack here.

One could argue that the issue has little to do with mapRelay, because mapRelay only delays the attack by 15 minutes. Instead of 30 seconds, a spy node could wait 15 minutes + 30 seconds to clear mapRelay for its spy purposes and then proceed. See also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27602#discussion_r1191600264\r\n\r\nSo if there is a fix for this it can (and probably should) be suggested and discussed independent of this pull.\r\n\r\n> Here's a test commit that adds that functionality https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f26a85059fb4eaf29f9c1652b2b5e14060d79a36 I'm now running that with logging for both relayed-from-most-recent-block and relayed-from-mapRelay-only to see how relevant those cases are in practice.\r\n\r\nHow would you judge \"relevant\"? I presume you are looking for rbf'd transactions that were requested from mapRelay and ended up in a block, but the block was not yet available to you when the tx was requested?\r\n\r\n> This resurrects https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17303, and it's probably worth reviewing the comments there;\r\n\r\nI don't think the discussion contains anything relevant anymore, since the tx relay logic has been completely reworked in the meantime. (As summarized by you). And the only relevant stuff (that mapRelay is needed for compact block relay) wasn't even mentioned in that thread.",

I think the test only checks for `sendcmpct 0` (low bandwidth) behavior. And only for the case where the `tx`-`getdata` was already sent on the wire, because otherwise Bitcoin Core on current `master` would queue it behind the `cmpctblock`-`getdata`, which would also delay the reply so much that it will be useless. For `sendcmpct 1` (high bandwidth) the `cmpctblock` is sent directly to the peer without consideration of any outstanding `getdata`.\r\n\r\nMaybe transactions that are in the block, and recent, and presumed to be not know by the peer can be pushed on the send buffer before the compact block message, even absent a corresponding `inv` or `getdata` for those transactions?",

There are many ways to use transaction relay behavior to infer the network topology, and I think there are downsides (perhaps mild) to both a node and the network if we do relay such transactions.  It seems like we all agree that this shouldn't be a requirement to dropping `mapRelay` but I just want to be clear that I think there is no benefit to doing so either.\r\n\r\n> When things gets broadcast and then quickly rbf'ed, our behaviour looks a little weird, eg:\r\n\r\nOne idea may be to add replaced transactions to a reject filter.\r\n\r\n> Maybe transactions that are in the block, and recent, and presumed to be not know by the peer can be pushed on the send buffer before the compact block message, even absent a corresponding inv or getdata for those transactions?\r\n\r\nNote that compact blocks can be sent with prefilled transactions for precisely this use case.  Some research should be done to come up with heuristics for determining when to include prefilled transactions (as there is a bandwidth, and therefore latency cost to including transactions that are unnecessary).  Anyway, I think that is work for another PR.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to move forward with a PR that uses the `m_recently_announced_invs` filter for now to determine when to relay from the mempool, or the most recent block, which I think is a very straightforward code change.  The PR that seeks to remove the recently announced filter should be easy to update to support what we're doing here.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
