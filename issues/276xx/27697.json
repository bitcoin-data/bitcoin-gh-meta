The wallet is created blank and I've imported descriptors to it. I have a total of 30 BTC in two outputs. I create a new transaction and save it as a PSBT for offline signing. When I try to read this file into bitcoin-qt again, it shows an error dialog with the message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnable to decode PSBT\r\nCDataStream::read(): end of data: iostream error\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've used this exact scenario successfully before, but with different wallets and with a different regtest blockchain.\r\n\r\nI've packed the full directory of my setup so that you can test what's going on. It was a bit too big to upload here so I put in on Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ILaYwsXuj3nG62UbGIh1k7q91fzcSbSG/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nI've tested this tar.tz on another laptop with the same result, so you should be able to reproduce it by following the instructions below.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe PSBT should be loaded with no issues.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nUsing that tar.gz file provided in this issue:\r\n\r\nunpack the tar.gz file, This will create a folder called online\r\ncd online\r\n./bitcoin-24.0.1/bin/bitcoin-qt -datadir=.bitcoin\r\n\r\nGo to the Send tab and enter the address bcrt1qm24myvzr3fv53q6cx3aghfp44x4r6let80sn5j and amount 25 BTC\r\nClick \"Create Unsigned\"\r\nClich \"Create Unsigned\"\r\nEnter a file name and Click \"Save\"\r\n\r\nThe PSBT is now saved on disk\r\n\r\nIn the same Bitcoin Core instance open the PSBT by:\r\n\r\nFile -> Load PSBT From File\r\nBrowse to the PSBT file you saved and click Open\r\n\r\nAn error box appears saying:\r\n\r\nUnable to decode PSBT\r\nCDataStream::read(): end of data: iostream error\r\n\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\r\n\r\nPre-built binaries\r\n\r\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\r\n\r\n24.0.1\r\n\r\n### Operating system and version\r\n\r\nDebian 11\r\n\r\n### Machine specifications\r\n\r\n_No response_",
