   "body" : "This adds the `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=1` environment variable as suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/reduce-memory.md#linux-specific to the systemd service file definition.\r\n\r\nWithout this env var, memory usage can grow significantly especially when `rpcthreads` is increased above its default value.\r\n\r\nCloses #24542.\r\n\r\nI have tested this change myself with positive results after dealing with memory consumption issues for a long time using systemd on a 8GB RAM raspi4. I figure a similar change may be desirable for the OpenRC and CentOS init files, but I don't have a way to test them and I'm not even exactly sure how environment variables should be added there (via `export` statements?).",
