   "body" : "This pull request is part of the `libbitcoinkernel` project https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/18 and more specifically its \"Step 2: Decouple most non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel\".\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt removes the kernel library's dependency on `util/system` and `interface_ui`. `util/system` contains networking and shell-related code that should not be part of the kernel library. The following pull requests prepared `util/system` for this final step: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27419 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27254 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27238.\r\n\r\n`interface_ui` defines functions for a more general node interface and has a dependency on `boost/signals2`. After applying the patches from this pull request, the kernel's reliance on boost is down to `boost::multiindex`.\r\n\r\nThe approach implemented here introduces some indirection, which makes the code a bit harder to read. Any suggestions for improving or reworking this pull request to make it more concise, or even reworking it into a more proper interface, are appreciated.",
