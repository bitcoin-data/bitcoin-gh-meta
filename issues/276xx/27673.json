This is not guaranteed until the `ConnectBlock` call right below it.\r\n\r\nThe total and average metric is not very useful because it does not distinguish between blocks read from disk and those loaded from memory. So rather than fixing the divide by zero issue, we just drop the metric.\r\n\r\nFixes #27635\r\n",
