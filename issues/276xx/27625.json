This should be fine, because the transaction will be re-added to the mempool and potentially announced/relayed on the next re-broadcast.\r\n`SIZELIMIT` | Removed in size limiting | A low fee transaction, which will be relayed by a different peer after `GETDATA_TX_INTERVAL` or after we sent a `notfound` message. Assuming it ever made it to another peer, otherwise it will happen on re-broadcast (same as with `EXPIRY` above).\r\n`REORG` | Removed for reorganization | Block races are rare, so reorgs should be rarer. Also, the transaction is likely to be re-accepted via the `disconnectpool` later on. If not, it seems fine to let the originating wallet deal with rebroadcast in this case.\r\n`BLOCK` | Removed for block | EDIT: Needed for compact block relay, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27625#issuecomment-1544047433\r\n`CONFLICT` | Removed for conflict with in-block transaction | The peer won't be able to add the tx to the mempool anyway, unless it is on a different block, in which case it seems fine to let the originating wallet take care of the rebroadcast (if needed).\r\n`REPLACED` | Removed for replacement | EDIT: Also needed for compact block relay, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27625#issuecomment-1544171255 ?",
