Closing for now, but anyone can still leave a comment here, and this can also be reopened if needed. Finally, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25839 was closed by the author, and is up for grabs. So if anyone wants to roll a ball, it could make more sense to pick it up than to ask others for more input, which was already provided in many places, most of which you already link to in your post.",
