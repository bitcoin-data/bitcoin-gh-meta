So would it be better to move that `DataDirectoryGroupReadable 1` suggestion a few lines earlier, next to `CookieAuthFileGroupReadable 1` and remove the sentence `On some systems ...`?\r\n\r\nI confirm that on FreeBSD, by default the tor data directory is not group readable:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndrwx------  7 _tor  _tor  13 Dec 28 12:24 /var/db/tor/\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut even if it was, that would not suffice for `bitcoind` to be able to read the cookie file, since it runs as the `bitcoin` user which does not belong to the `_tor` group. I guess an extra step of adding `bitcoin` to the `_tor` group would be required. @jessebarton, do you have it running with cookie auth on FreeBSD? Did you add `bitcoin` to the `_tor` group?",
