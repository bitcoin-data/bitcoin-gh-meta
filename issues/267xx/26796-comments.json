      "body" : "Hope this helps and is a correct example of using the RNDR and RNDRRS instructions in ARM assembly language for bitcoin mining:\r\n\r\nmov     x0, #0\r\nmrs     x1, cntpct_el0\r\nmov     x2, #32\r\nrndr    x3, x0, x1, x2\r\n\r\n; Use the generated random number as a nonce in a hash function\r\nmov     x4, x3\r\nbl      hash_function\r\n\r\n; Compare the resulting hash with the target difficulty\r\nmov     x5, TARGET_DIFFICULTY\r\ncmp     x4, x5\r\nbgt     retry\r\n\r\n; If the hash is less than the target, it is a valid solution\r\n; and can be submitted to the network\r\nmov     x6, x3\r\nbl      submit_solution\r\n\r\nretry:\r\n; Increment the nonce and repeat the process\r\nadd     x3, x3, #1\r\nb       start\r\n\r\nhash_function:\r\n; Implementation of the hash function, such as SHA-256\r\n; ...\r\n\r\nsubmit_solution:\r\n; Submit the solution to the network\r\n; ...\r\n\r\nIn this example, the rndr instruction generates a 32-byte random number that is used as the nonce in a hash function. The hash function is implemented in the hash_function label, and the submit_solution label is used to submit the solution to the network. The code retries the process by incrementing the nonce and repeating the hash function until a valid solution is found.\r\n\r\nNote that this is just a simple example, and in actual practice, the hash function used for bitcoin mining is more complex and requires more processing power. Additionally, you should take steps to ensure that the random numbers generated by the RNDR / RNDRRS instructions are of sufficient quality for the bitcoin core cryptographic calculation.\r\n",
