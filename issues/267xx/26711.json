   "body" : "This contains everything to make mempool/validation logic ready for package relay (see #27463).\r\n\r\nThe hope here is to end up with the incentive-compatible transactions in our mempool. Prior to this commit, if parents within the package relied on each other, we could end up (1) accepting a low-feerate child or (2) rejecting high-feerate parents. See the \"interdependent parents\" test case for a specific example.\r\n\r\nThis also includes some shortcuts to reduce the amount of validation work we are doing:\r\n- Don't validate the last tx twice.\r\n- If the last transaction is by itself, call `AcceptSingleTransaction()` instead of `AcceptMultipleTransactions()`. This skips `PackageMempoolChecks()` on it.\r\n- If a transaction depends on something that failed for a non-policy reason, don't validate it, just return missing inputs.\r\n\r\nThese smaller changes also reduce the diff of the main \"validate sub-packages\" commit: Instead of validating each transaction *individually* in turn, validate each one with their *in-package ancestor set* (excluding the ones that already made it into the mempool). This means parents with inter-dependencies are validated correctly, while we continue using aggregate totals for package feerate.",
