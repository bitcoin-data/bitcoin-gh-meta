Abort existing rescan or wait.`.\r\n\r\nI'm running a rescan for each RPC command being tested instead of only one for all to avoid intermittent failures.\r\nEach rescan takes about 2 seconds, enough time to run the tested RPC commands simultaneously.\r\nI added this test in `feature_pruning.py` to use the large chain generated and renamed it to `feature_large_chain.py` as I think it is more appropriate now.\r\n",
