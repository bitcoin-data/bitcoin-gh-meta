Then perform\r\nCoin Selection.\r\n\r\nAs the selection of the 1515 small UTXOs exceeds the max allowed tx size, the\r\nexpectation here is to receive a selection result that only contain the big UTXO\r\n(which is not happening for the reason stated below).\r\n\r\nKnapsack returns a result that exceeds the max allowed transaction size, so we\r\nfallback to SRD who selects coins randomly up until the target is met. So\r\nwe end up with a selection result with lot more coins than what is needed.\r\n\r\nExtra Note:\r\nFor now, this solves the unexpected behavior but.. in the future, we should move\r\ninto a smarter direction, probably measure the weight while we select coins instead\r\nof doing it only at the end of the process.",
