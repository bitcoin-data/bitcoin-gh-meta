   "body" : "Both `double_lock_detected()` and `potential_deadlock_detected()` functions call `LogPrintf()` which in turn implies locking of the `Logger::m_cs` mutex. To avoid a deadlock, the latter must not have the `Mutex` type (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16112).\r\n\r\nWith this PR the mentioned restriction has been lifted, and it is possible now to use our regular `Mutex` type for the `Logger::m_cs` mutex instead of a dedicated `StdMutex` type (not introducing that change here, as its diff is much bigger than a few lines, and the currently proposed diff seems valuable by itself).\r\n\r\n**Note for reviewers:** Make sure the code is configured and built with `CPPFLAGS=-DDEBUG_LOCKORDER`.",
