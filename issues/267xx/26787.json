Moreover, there are core problems relating to the technical convergence between the macOS GUI and Terminal App CLI. Specifically, the GUI and CLI are not in sync, which signifies problems deeper in the macOS architecture. \r\n\r\nI think it is important to focus on solving the real problem at hand, which is how to build bitcoin with a Mac. There is no reason to reference or direct developers to the Applications folder that I know of and please correct me if you believe I am mistaken. Here, the Principle of Parismony should apply and the simpler explanation is better.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
