I am still working through the pathing problem on installation defined in #26778. I ran into a massive sub-problem with the data requirements and now have to remove the installed software, but I'm struggling to find it on my machine because of the broader pathing issue.\r\n\r\nSome questions I have generally on contributions to Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n1. Does the core team want OSS developers to contribute?\r\n2. Does the core team want to solve problems in Bitcoin Core?\r\n3. What incentive is there for contributing to Bitcoin Core?\r\n\r\nI am indifferent to the answer to these questions, I just don't have a good way to gauge the climate or need for the network. So, I only identify problems based on my own experience developing. Of course, one developers problems could also be another developers solution, especially if the intention is to keep developers out, as is the case with many L1s. It's ok if that is the intention here too, it would just be helpful to know ahead of time. I don't want to bother anyone here if the core team does not want help or new solutions.",

There are a lot of open issues of any difficulty waiting to be fixed. However, before you start contributing, familiarize yourself with the Bitcoin Core build system and tests. Refer to the documentation in the repository on how to build Bitcoin Core and how to run the unit and functional tests. Once that is done, you are all set.\r\n\r\nIf you need more help getting started, please refer to the following resources:\r\n\r\n* https://medium.com/@amitiu/onboarding-to-bitcoin-core-7c1a83b20365\r\n* https://jonatack.github.io/articles/how-to-review-pull-requests-in-bitcoin-core\r\n\r\n### Pick something to work on\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for useful contributions to help out with, you can\r\n\r\n* Search through the [good first issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)s or the ones that are [up for grabs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22Up+for+grabs%22). Some of them might no longer be applicable. So if you are interested, but unsure, you might want to leave a comment on the issue first.\r\n* Write tests to improve the coverage. Any kind of test is welcome and coverage information can be obtained from a relatively recent [coverage report](https://marcofalke.github.io/btc_cov). If you are unsure, don't hesitate to check back first.\r\n* Help with review and testing. There are easy ones such as the [gui](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pulls) and [rpc](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3ARPC%2FREST%2FZMQ). However, review on any open pull request is welcome. Review will also help you understand the codebase better.\r\n* Help on meta projects related to Bitcoin Core, such as a [high-level performance monitor](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/bitcoinperf).\r\n* Join us on irc and let us know what you are interested in.",
