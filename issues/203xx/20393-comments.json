Not even sure if I have used the `if` statement at the right place because I tried compiling (no errors), tests passed but I was still able to create wallet name with invalid characters.\r\n\r\nAny help in solving this problem will be appreciated. I referred to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ba1f128d6c117a63d5d904b3956551bd83405ec9 so assuming I will have to make few changes in `src/wallet/wallet.cpp` and write a test for it in `functional/wallet_createwallet.py`\r\n\r\nOr I can close this PR if someone has a better approach, code to solve this problem and has the time to work on a new PR",

      "body" : "@ysangkok replaced `regex` with `string::front`\r\n@promag added tests in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20393/commits/c04c47384533b15214859fc5e2f3d4d578da2ebe although I am not sure if they are correct and doing this for the first time\r\n\r\n@luke-jr \r\n> Although it would be best if there's a filesystem-specific call, since this may vary by OS... (see test/functional/feature_notifications.py:FILE_CHARS_DISALLOWED)\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing the link. I checked it, did some research and thought its best to avoid dependency on checking OS for this `if` statement because of two reasons:\r\n1. Some users might hide/change things so that attackers cannot identify OS\r\n2. We don't know how many types of OS are used for running bitcoin core, their characters usage and new updates. Also lot of OS are now supporting things that were only available on other OS in past. Example: Ubuntu in Windows\r\n\r\n@kristapsk Removed regex\r\n\r\n> And as there is anyway a plan to use C++17 for the next major release after v0.21, std::filename::filename looks like a right solution to me.\r\n\r\nMaybe. I am not the best person to comment on things related to C++\r\n\r\nAlso not sure why tests are failing in CI. Everything worked fine on my local machine and I tested with different wallet names.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/102725685-8f87b100-433e-11eb-9715-c037314e8019.png)\r\n",
