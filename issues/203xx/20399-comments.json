It is holding back the next minor release which has already quite a few bugfixes waiting to be shipped.\r\n\r\nI can't vouch whether the backport is safe or unsafe, but we've never delayed a bugfix release to backport a feature. Also, I think this is the first time ever that a feature was backported to a bugfix release and released before it was released in a major version.\r\n\r\nIf #20317 gets enough review to make it into the release, fine by me. Otherwise the milestone will simply be adjusted by one minor version. Also, no review will be lost. Observing and ACKing an empty diff can be done by anyone.",
