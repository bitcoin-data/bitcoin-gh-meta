   "body" : "As per [brief discussion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17736#issuecomment-727264508). Visual Studio 2019 and Appveyor images have recently been updated. While it's only a minor update that doesn't break ABI compatibility it does seem to have broken compatibility for Release builds. This apparently occurs if compiler optimisations are turned on.\r\n\r\nThis PR switches the Appveyor CI job from a Release build to a Debug build in order to fix the CI failures.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to this PR I will commence a new build of the Qt static libraries with the latest Visual Studio 2019 toolset so that release build can work again.",
