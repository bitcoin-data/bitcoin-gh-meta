Warm welcome as a contributor! â¤ï¸ \r\n\r\nTo guard against this type of error entering our code base: consider enabling the `flake8` check `F632` in our `lint-python.sh` linter. That check would have caught this issue, but we're currently not opt-ing in to it :)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ flake8 --select F632 contrib/devtools/security-check.py\r\ncontrib/devtools/security-check.py:65:24: F632 use ==/!= to compare str, bytes, and int literals\r\n```",
