The reason for backporting was *not* that it was a requirement for taproot. It was discussed as being an independently useful change. wtxid relay has been wanted since segwit was introduced (#8279), the feature was developed against 0.20, and missed feature freeze by a few weeks, so was a trivial backport.\r\n\r\n> people weren't aware that this change relay introduced a crash vulnerability (which was accidentally fixed by a separate re-factoring change)\r\n\r\nThe crash vulnerability that you're refering to wasn't introduced in #18044. It came in commit [`9efd86a` (#19569)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19569/commits/9efd86a908cf09d9ddbadd3195f202635117d505) in the follow-up PR. It wasn't 'accidentally fixed by a separate refactoring change' - I explicitly pointed out the problem in review here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19569#discussion_r462887483, and wrote a fix here: [`fb56d37` (#19610)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19610/commits/fb56d37612dea6666e7da73d671311a697570dae), which was included in the follow-up PR. I've also included that commit in this backport.\r\n\r\nI still think it's useful to have wtxid relay widely deployed (and also have the ability to request orphan parents from wtxid peers). If other people disagree, then we can close this PR.",
