Thanks for fixing this!\r\n\r\nReally nice to see the fuzzers catch real issues long before they have a chance to make it to a release.\r\n\r\n&lt;wish list&gt;\r\nNow we only need something like OSS-Fuzz' [CIFuzz](https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/getting-started/continuous-integration/) (fuzzing of open PR:s) to catch issues like this before merge. OSS-Fuzz is open source in the form of [ClusterFuzz](https://github.com/google/clusterfuzz). I hope that some day we'll have a dedicated Bitcoin Core private ClusterFuzz installation where the security team would have immediate access to crash cases.\r\n\r\nCI-Fuzz: _\"OSS-Fuzz offers CIFuzz, a GitHub action/CI job that runs your fuzz targets on pull requests. This works similarly to running unit tests in CI. CIFuzz helps you find and fix bugs before they make it into your codebase. Currently, CIFuzz only supports projects hosted on GitHub.\"_\r\n\r\nClusterFuzz: _\"ClusterFuzz is a scalable fuzzing infrastructure that finds security and stability issues in software. Google uses ClusterFuzz to fuzz all Google products and as the fuzzing backend for OSS-Fuzz.\"_\r\n&lt;/wish list&gt;\r\n\r\n",
