It completely destroys the purpose of using descriptor wallets because it will reintroduce the ambiguity about what kind of addresses are in the wallet. If you want to have BIP 39 in descriptors, then do BIP 39 in descriptors themselves. Users could then import a descriptor containing a BIP 39 seed via `importdescriptors`. Don't do this thing where we try to make descriptor wallets have an hd seed (they really don't) and then set that seed. That's a legacy wallet thing.",
