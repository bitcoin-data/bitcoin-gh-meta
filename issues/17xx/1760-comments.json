Keep it at a warning, assume the user knows what they're doing. It can be an enormous security breach to connect directly outside the proxy.\n  - Also remember that proxies can suffer from intermittent failures. One failed connection attempt doesn't tell that much. But a pop-up / warning in log is nice.\n- Should this be in the init() or in the network thread, or even in its own thread? After all, I'm don't think that a slow proxy should hold up the startup process\n- Talking of slow proxies: is there a timeout? Or will specifying a non-existent host hold up the initialization forever?\n",

I see the current implementation just as a startup check, which could be extended to a proactive meassurement thread or sth.\n- As to init(), network or own thread I have no final belief, where this is suited best ...\n- There currently is just a 1sec timeout and if that passed the warning is shown.\n",
