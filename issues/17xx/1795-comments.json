Together with the tweak, however, the first and the last now get seeds tweak and tweak-1. I think something simpler like k1_i+k2*n+tweak is better (with k1 and k2 arbitrary large odd 32-bit integers).\n- I feel uneasy about the arbitrary filter parameters used for the implicitly created filter when sending filteradd without filterload. The server cannot be expected to make a reasonable guess how the client is going to use the filter, and the client still has to track how large the server-side filter grows anyway. I'd prefer to make this simply illegal (DoS 100): filteradd always requires an active filter. Maybe the actual filter data in filterload can be made optional: if it is omitted, it's assumed to be all zeroes (though that would mean the size has to be specified).\n",
