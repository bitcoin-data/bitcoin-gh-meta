While doing some tests with it, I observed a strange thing.\n- start Bitcoin-Qt\n- while it syncs the block chain enter RPC console\n- enter `setgenerate true`\n- a block was foundm (Client did not yet catch up) and the client now displays `Warning: Displayed transactions may not be correct! You may need to upgrade, or other nodes may need to upgrade.`\n\nI can't tell if this is a problem of the internal miner (@gmaxwell said it has some errors in) or a problem that raised after Ultraprune though.\n",
