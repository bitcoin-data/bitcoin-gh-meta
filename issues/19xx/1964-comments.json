As a plus, you will learn a lot about linker internals :frog:!\n\n@gavinandresen I have a build for bitcoind + bitcoin-qt + most deps (everything in one project for easy building) for VS somewhere, but my Visual Studio trial license expired along the way (and there's no way I'm going to put any money into it). \nIt'd be a matter of adding leveldb to get it to work. Anyway, no one showed interest up until now. There are just not that many windows developers partaking in open source, and those that do (like Diapolo) seem to use the mingw toolchain / qt creator.\n\n**Alternatively** (it's the option I prefer at the moment) is that we add a cmake build system and let it generate all the build scripts for all platforms for us. qmake scales very badly to big projects and is starting to show its seams, and will likely be deprecated somewhere along the road to Qt5. I may get around to this.\n",

Doesn't matter to me.  What I want to do is get bitcoin-qt to compile so I can debug it.\n\nThe instructions insinuate that there are \"mingw contents\" in the SDK.  I installed the SDK 5 days ago and as I wrote in an earlier message, \"I think my QT installation detected my existing MinGW installation and didn't install its own.\"  Does that make sense?  If that is the case, then can I expect the build of QT to succeed by changing the path to MinGW32_x86 from `C:\\qt-4.7.4\\mingw32_x86\\bin` to `C:\\MinGW\\bin`?  That's what I did...\n\nThe instructions also said to copy Perl into the build directory.  My perl comes from my installation of git (git\\bin\\perl.exe), so I copied the entire git\\bin directory to `c:\\qt-4.7.4\\tools\\Perl\\bin`.\n\nI got this error while executing `c:\\qt-4.7.4\\qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.7.4\\configure.exe -redo`:\n\n```\nC:\\qt-4.7.4\\qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.7.4/src/corelib/tools/qlocale.cpp: In\n function 'char* qdtoa(double, int, int, int*, int*, char**, char**)':\nC:\\qt-4.7.4\\qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.7.4/src/corelib/tools/qlocale.cpp:\n6626:14: error: '_clear87' was not declared in this scope\nC:\\qt-4.7.4\\qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.7.4/src/corelib/tools/qlocale.cpp:\n6627:43: error: '_control87' was not declared in this scope\nMakefile:179: recipe for target 'qlocale.o' failed\nmingw32-make: *** [qlocale.o] Error 1\n```\n\n_clear87 and _control87 are declared in float.h in standard C, I learned from Digital Mars (http://www.digitalmars.com/rtl/float.html), but there is no float.h in the QT build directory.  In fact there is no file except qlocale.cpp that has _clear87 in it.  So I must be missing some source that declares it.  Where could that be?  Maybe MinGW32_x86 would have had it...  I found it in c:\\mingw\\include\\float.h.  Is configure.exe supposed to run some of the bin files in mingw32_x86 and in that way discover the header files in its include directory?  That seems odd.  Help??\n",

      "body" : "Alright, so let's do a step-by-step for getting Qt compiled on Windows with an own MinGW (which you indeed have).\n1. Install ActivePerl (mine is ActivePerl 5.14.2 Build 1402), which is needed to compile Qt (you need to google the download) and update it's components via Perl Package Manager (start menu).\n2. Get qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.2.zip (as I had problems when using 4.8.3 because of a qmake problem with resource-files).\n3. Extract the contents of that folder to disk, set this path as environment-variable QTDIR (for me this is `D:\\Qt_4.8.2`) and open command-prompt and `cd %QTDIR%`.\n4. Ensure your PATH variable contains `D:\\MinGW\\bin;%QTDIR%\\lib;%QTDIR%\\bin;` (path to your MinGW bin directory and to the new Qt versions lib and bin folder).\n5. For a release build (which can't be used for Debugging - If you need a debugging build, you could replace `-release` with `--debug-and-release`) I used this switch the last time:\n   `configure.exe -opensource -confirm-license -release -arch windows -platform win32-g++-4.6 -no-dbus -no-dsp -no-gif -no-libtiff -no-phonon -no-phonon-backend -no-qt3support -no-vcproj -no-webkit -no-style-cde -no-style-cleanlooks -no-style-motif -no-style-plastique -no-style-s60 -no-style-windowsce -no-style-windowsmobile -nomake demos -nomake examples -qt-style-windows -qt-style-windowsxp -qt-style-windowsvista -qt-libmng -qt-libpng -qt-zlib -3dnow -mmx -sse -sse2`\n6. Now let's build Qt via `mingw32-make.exe -j` (which will make your PC very unresponsitive, so let it run until that process finished).\n7. You know need to add this Qt version to Qt Creator, which is beyond the scope of this little how-to.\n\nHope this helps :).\n",

      "body" : "Thanks for the instructions, and the pointer that 4.8.3. has a qmake problem with resource files.  I'm working on compiling Qt as I type this.  I asked a bunch of questions and I think your instructions answer some, but I wanted to check that I understand:\n\nIs it reasonable to expect the Boost libraries that I compile under cygwin to be valid for use under MinGW when I use them to build the LevelDB libraries? Answer from Gavin and laanwj: No.  Use the same toolchain for everything.  As per Diapolo, that would be MinGW/QTCreator.  Followup question:  MinGW is the compiler, and QTCreator is the IDE, right?\n\nI think my QT installation detected my existing MinGW installation and didn't install its own. Does that make sense? I got no direct answer, but Diapolo provided instructions on building QT4.8.2 with a custom install of MinGW, so I'm assuming QT detected the existing install and skipped its own.\n\n[T]here is no file except qlocale.cpp that has _clear87 in it. So I must be missing some source that declares it. Where could that be?  I answered this one myself.  My custom MinGW install had it in float.h in its own include directory.\n\nIs configure.exe supposed to run some of the bin files in mingw32_x86 and in that way discover the header files in its include directory?  I think the answer is no, and that the problem with the float.h file is a bug in the QT 4.7.4 source that requires MinGW to be at `C:\\qt-4.7.4\\mingw32_x86` - a bug not important to fix since there is a later version of QT anyway.\n",

Either the instructions are wrong or I'm missing something here.\n\nPerhaps what I'm missing is that \"USE_UPNP=-\" means don't put anything after the =.  I tried \"USE_UPNP=\" and it compiled, but it still gets the same segfault I reported earlier when I try to debug it.  But \"USE_UPNP=\" is the same as not adding anything, isn't it?\n\nI found a reference to the USE_UPNP in \\doc\\build-msw.txt:\n`UPnP support is optional, make with USE_UPNP= to disable it.` so I added a line to bitcoin-qt.pro: `#  for Windows: qmake \"USE_UPNP=\" (disabled)`  Only you wrote \"I use \"USE_UPNP=-\"\", so perhaps I am confusing the \"build-msw\" with MinGW on Windows.  Doesn't the build-msw.txt file apply to building on a Windows box using MinGW under QT?  Wouldn't you have had to use \"USE_UPNP=\"?\n\nAlso, you said I hadn't checked out my branch, and that made sense to me, but it says I'm already on it and it lists the commit:\n\n```\ndscotese@DAVESTOSHIBA /c/qt/projects/bitcoin/src (ds_native_windows)\n$ git checkout ds_native_windows\nM       bitcoin-qt.pro\nM       src/leveldb/build_detect_platform\nAlready on 'ds_native_windows'\n\ndscotese@DAVESTOSHIBA /c/qt/projects/bitcoin/src (ds_native_windows)\n$ git log ../doc/readme-qt.rst\ncommit cb6c9a69e6e654db49961510b1466da8fa681b7b\nAuthor: dscotese <dscotese@litmocracy.com>\nDate:   Sat Dec 1 22:36:44 2012 -0800\n\n    Much more detail about compiling on native Windows with MinGW.\n```\n\nSo I don't know how to make my ds_native_windows branch available to you so you can see the edits I made to the section on building under Windows.  I'll post it here if you want, but I'd rather use it to figure out how to make stuff available through git.\n",

I still get the segfault, so I figured I should clean everything and rebuild.  if that works, it would suggest that USE_UPNP appears somewhere other than net.cpp, and I don't think that's true.\n\nNext theory is that I've compiled with different toolchains.  QT does list two MinGWs, but the only differences is that the one I've selected for this build specifies a Debugger (the other one, auto-detected, is called \"MinGW (x86 32bit)\" instead of just \"MinGW\", and has no Debugger), but the Compiler path and ABI are the same for both.  Oh, except for the case of the directory name (auto-detect gets mingw, and the one I entered is MinGW).  So I assume QT is listing the same toolchain twice.  Maybe I used something else to compile one of the libraries I'm using.  Hmm... the files in the Dependencies zip included more than just the boost libraries - crypto, db, and ssl.  I guess I need to compile all of them with my Mingw.  So that's my next step.\n\nI am using this issue as a sort of weblog, but if there's a better place for me to log my progress for others who want to see someone climb this learning curve, let me know and I'll put it there instead.\n",

Extract the contents of that folder to disk, set this path as environment-variable QTDIR and open command-prompt and cd %QTDIR%.\n  4. Ensure your PATH variable contains the path to the bin  subdirectory of your MinGW installation, and the lib and bin subdirectories of QTDIR (for example D:\\MinGW\\bin;%QTDIR%\\lib;%QTDIR%\\bin;).\n  5. For a release build (which can't be used for Debugging - If you need a debugging build, you could replace -release with -debug-and-release) I used this switch the last time:\n     configure.exe -opensource -confirm-license -release -arch windows -platform win32-g++-4.6 -no-dbus -no-dsp -no-gif -no-libtiff -no-phonon -no-phonon-backend -no-qt3support -no-vcproj -no-webkit -no-style-cde -no-style-cleanlooks -no-style-motif -no-style-plastique -no-style-s60 -no-style-windowsce -no-style-windowsmobile -nomake demos -nomake examples -qt-style-windows -qt-style-windowsxp -qt-style-windowsvista -qt-libmng -qt-libpng -qt-zlib -3dnow -mmx -sse -sse2\n  6. Now let's build Qt via mingw32-make.exe -j (which will make your PC very unresponsitive, so let it run until that process finished).\n  7. You now need to add this Qt version to Qt Creator, which is beyond the scope of this little how-to, but it is described at http://doc.qt.digia.com/qtcreator-2.4/creator-project-qmake.html.\n  - Compiling Boost:\n    Example for Boost 1.51 extracted to what we'll use as BOOST_ROOT below:\n  \n  Set the BOOST_ROOT environment variable to the location of your boost_1_51 directory or cd to that directory and stay in it.\n  \n  open BOOST_ROOT\\bootstrap.bat\n  replace set toolset=msvc with set toolset=gcc\n  \n  open BOOST_ROOT\\tools\\build\\v2\\engine\\build.bat and search for mingw\n  \n  replace existing code with:\n  \n  if EXIST \"(your MinGW directory, for example D:\\MinGW)\\bin\\gcc.exe\" (\n  set \"BOOST_JAM_TOOLSET=mingw\"\n  set \"BOOST_JAM_TOOLSET_ROOT=(your MinGW directory)\"\n  \n  open your Qt or MinGW command prompt and cd %BOOST_ROOT%\n  \n  You can also just use the Windows command-promt (cmd), if you setup all Qt stuff in the envirionment variables!\n  \n  enter bootstrap.bat gcc\n  \n  This builds b2, the Boost build engine b2!\n  \n  create the libs needed by Bitcoin:\n  \n  b2 --toolset=gcc --build-dir=%BOOST_ROOT%\\build --build-type=minimal stage link=static runtime-link=static threading=multi variant=release -a -j 4 --with-filesystem --with-program_options --with-system --with-thread\n  \n  This should create all .a files you need for Bitcoin-Qt and they can be found in *_BOOST_ROOT_\\build, just search for *.a in that dir ;).\n  \n  Add these .a files to the lib directory under your MinGW install directory.\n  Update the line in bitcoin-qt.pro to specify the correct BOOST_LIB_SUFFIX (near the comment \"platform specific defaults\")\n  - Compiling BDB\n    - Download Berkely Database version 4.8.30.NC from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/products/berkeleydb/downloads/index.html and unzip it to a path without spaces in it (Paths with spaces are not proven as of this writing, and spaceless paths are always safer anyway).\n  - Open a MinGW shell and cd to the build_unix directory.\n    Execute ../dist/configure --disable-replication --enable-mingw --enable-cxx --prefix=/usr/local\n    (This creates the build files in build_unix, which started out empty, so now you can...)\n  - Edit db.h in build_unix/\n    @ Line 113 Replace\n  \n  typedef pthread_t db_threadid_t;\n  \n  with\n  \n  typedef u_int32_t db_threadid_t;\n  - Now you can use make to compile it.\n  - Copy the files from build_unix/.libs to the lib subdirectory of your MinGW directory.\n  - Compiling Open SSL\n    - Download OpenSSL from http://www.openssl.org/source/ and unzip it to a path without spaces.\n  - cd to that path and Execute perl Configure mingw no-shared no-asm --prefix=/c/OpenSSL\n  - Execute the following:\n  \n  make depend\n  \n  make\n  \n  make install\n  - These instructions thanks to ereOn at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9379363/how-to-build-openssl-with-mingw-in-windows.\n  - Compile leveldb (and memenv):\n    - Edit bitcoin-qt\\src\\leveldb\\build_detect_platform to set the PLATFORM_EXTRALIBS (in section OS_WINDOWS_CROSSCOMPILE)match the filenames produced by compiling the Boost libraries.\n  - In your MinGW shell cd to your bitcoin/src/leveldb directory\n  - Execute TARGET_OS=OS_WINDOWS_CROSSCOMPILE make libleveldb.a libmemenv.a\n\nIf you want to skip miniupnp, you can, just remember to add USE_UPNP=- to the switches on qmake in QT Creator when you build bitcoin-qt.  If you want miniupnp, try this (not yet proven):\n- Download and extract `miniupnpc`_ into bitcoin/src/miniupnpc directory.  \n- Compile miniupnpc.  This may require that you edit the Makefile.mingw file to include a relative path to ws2_32.dll (eg ../../../../../Windows/System32/ws2_32.dll) as part of the LDLIBS variable, and also add #define _WIN32_WINNT 0x0501 above the headers in connecthostport.c.\n- Copy the resulting miniupnpc.lib file (in bitcoin/src/miniupnpc) into your MinGW lib directory.\n- Open the bitcoin-qt.pro file in Qt Creator and comment out lines 97 - 111, as these fail on native windows to build the leveldb and memenv assembler (.a) files.  Build as normal (ctrl-B)\n\n.. _`Qt Windows SDK`: http://qt-project.org/downloads/\n.. _`dependencies archive`: https://download.visucore.com/bitcoin/qtgui_deps_1.zip\n..

      "body" : "I don't understand \"so perhaps just try a release build before.\"  Do you mean that IF the release build works as expected, then I can assume the debugger needs to be compiled with the same version of QT that I used to compile bitcoin-qt?  I suppose that makes sense.  The gdb being used was last written about 2 months before I posted this issue, so clearly, I'm not using a gdb that I compiled.\n\nThe attempt to compile the release version issues a warning: \n\nC:\\Qt\\projects\\bitcoin\\src\\qt\\qtipcserver.cpp:22: warning: #warning Compiling without BOOST_INTERPROCESS_HAS_WINDOWS_KERNEL_BOOTTIME and BOOST_INTERPROCESS_HAS_KERNEL_BOOTTIME uncommented in boost/interprocess/detail/tmp_dir_helpers.hpp or using a boost version before 1.49 may have unintended results see svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5392 [-Wcpp]\n\nThey are NOT uncommented, which means they aren't in effect, and perhaps boost's interprocess does have the kernel boottime (whatever that means).  There is no commented define for these macros in the indicated file, so I'm a little lost.  I just added #defines for them and recompiled and I'm still getting the same segfault.\nAnyway, I am using QT 4.8.2 as you suggested, and I built it myself following your instructions as indicated in my previous comment = reference to the readme-qt.rst edit I made.\n\nIt compiled (mingw32-make.exe exited normally), but when I ran it, it immediately failed with 0x3FFFFECB.  How do I figure out what that exit code means?  Heh - by debugging.  Ok...\n\nI watched the registers before I made the release build and determined that A) 0x5ec21b <+0x000b> movl $0xb5ba68,(%ebx)` doesn't move the contents of 0xb5ba68, but rather the value 0xb5ba68, into the memory address stored in %ebx, which **is 15!!**.  It's a base index register, so maybe that is relative to something else, but I'm guessing that whatever memory address it's pointing to isn't accessible and thus the segmentation fault.  Please correct any boneheaded things I've said.  I'm totally guessing.\n\nGuess I try compiling my own gdb next.\n",
