That's how once I learnt about command line options in general so IMHO it makes sense to keep it (on GNU/Linux too). Even more so as copying & pasting its content works fine. Sure, you'll get questions but some people will also learn about these options.\n\n> I'm sorry for the effort you put into reporting this issue but I have to close this with \"WONTFIX\".\n\nIn fact I thought devs had forgotten to polish that window so wanted to bring it to your attention, just in case. But no problem if Qt's limitations prevent that polishing: it's already good enough and helpful as it is, so thanks for replying and keep coding for us :p\n",
