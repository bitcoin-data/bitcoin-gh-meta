I just lost 30 minutes of my life, just to write this. \n\nNO NO NO Just to be sure I have just installed the bitcoin-0.7.0-win32-setup.exe from SourceForge. Now.... There isn't any GPL.txt file (or similar file with the license) (this makes bitcoin incompatible with both GPL and LGPL), there isn't any LGPL.txt file (or similar file with the license) (this makes bitcoin incompatible with LGPL). And point 2b of the GPL license: b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, **_to be licensed**_ as a whole at no charge to all third parties **_under the terms of this License**_. The subject is YOU. I don't think it is enough that the software is relicenseable because it's MIT licensed. I think YOU (plural, not you luke-jr) would at least need to dual license it explicitly under MIT and GPL. And last, in the COPYING.txt file, the program is explicitly licensed under the MIT license. Now, morally you are perhaps fine with GPL because you are distributing the source code (it's even included in the installer, but note that it isn't complete... For example the bitcoin-qt.pro file is missing, so that you can't build the QT project. Point 3 of the GPL license: \"plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable\" so this copy of the source isn't enough. But you can download the source from this site, right? A shame that in all the installed files there isn't a link to this site or an email address of a programmer. The only link is to https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page)\n",

Since the MIT license allows anyone to relicense the work under more restrictive terms, the rest of the code _can be licensed by anyone_ under the terms of the GPL _in addition to_ the MIT license. If the bitcoin-qt.pro file is missing from the installed source code, I think that is a bug. The (L)GPL licenses further also consider publishing the source code - even if on a different server - with equivalent accessibility, to be identical to including it verbatim with the binary object: therefore we do not strictly require a link included (though it would be a good idea).\n",
