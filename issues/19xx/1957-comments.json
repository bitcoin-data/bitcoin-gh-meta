You could even generalize it to multiple files by signing a \"manifest\" (similar to how JAR files are signed). As an added bonus, you can choose any hash function you want to hash the files. This can all be implemented as client-only feature.\n\nWe have the mantra that everything that can be done outside the core, should be done outside the core. The discussion isn't about whether this feature deserves including or not!\n\n_an external tool will lead to lack of adoption_ that depends on how you market it.

Discussion is good.\n\nI'd still really like to see a \"standardized\" way of signing files with my bitcoin key, but I agree the API doesn't really need to be any bigger than it is. How about keeping \"signfile\" and \"verifyfile\" as client-side calls that generate a hash of the file that's sent to the server for re-hashing and signing. I think _something_ like this belongs in this client, as it's basically the reference implementation of bitcoin, there's not much point signing files in a different way in each different client.\n",
