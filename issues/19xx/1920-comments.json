This is a classical use-after-free:\n\n```\nconst char* pszDataDir = GetDataDir().string().c_str();\n```\n- string() creates a temporary string\n- c_str takes a pointer (which is a non-owning reference) to the buffer of that temporary string \n- the temporary string is freed after leaving this statement\n- we have a pointer pointing to unallocated memory, which gives us a fun surprise (the stringified date, even!)\n\nSubtle bugs like this are why I always (less subtly) encourage people to use proper string types and not char*. This one must have slipped by :(\n\nGoing to take a stab at fixing it.\n",
