I was a little unsure, but now think that is fine ... at least it would be a massive headache to get a check in for this, as OK is always active.\n\nThe next heavy thing is when using -tor with -proxy, where the former overwrites the second. I then need to implement the same checks used in the core for Qt, which results in duplicated and nearly identical code. But I'm only starting to think about that part, so no hurry.\n\nAre you fine with updating all missing options to your proposed default behaviour? As I said at least the language setting is missing there.\n",
