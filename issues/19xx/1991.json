In fact,\n    seeing all TXs tagged with the time at which they get included\n    in the blockchain makes more sense : in a way, it's the time the\n    TX became valid, and if we have to pick one canonically representative\n    time for a TX, first block inclusion time is better than first\n    broadcast time.\n```\n",
