HTTP Digest authentication was considered\ninitially, but that may require additional HTTP round-trips.  The standard\nHMAC-SHA256 algorithm pair was chosen instead, with some additional stirring\nfactors (random nonce, time).\n\nThe HTTP server will accept Basic or Bitcoin authentication now.\n\nThe HTTP client will attempt Bitcoin authentication, and fall back to\nBasic if that fails.\n",
