Most likely fread() will continue to work beyond even 4GB boundary, if we read linearly and accumulate the file position ourselves.\n\n2) Most of the code uses 32 bits for file position, which is highly disappointing.  At a minimum, we should make sure that external serialized storage in databases like ultraprune record 64-bit file positions.\n",
