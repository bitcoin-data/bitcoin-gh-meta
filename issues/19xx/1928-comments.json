The use cases I can think of all involve negotiation between the people who hold the keys, and I assume that the transaction id would be included in that negotiation (in which case you use getrawtransaction/signrawtransaction to spend).\n\nThe multi-device wallet will definitely require a new type of 'ismine' key, where it IS yours, but one of the private keys is on another device that you own (and when that is implemented I assume listtransactions/etc will show those payments).\n",

I was planning on having the server that watches for incoming deposits have one key and then there would be at least one other key stored elsewhere that would be needed to process withdrawals. In this type of scenario you control all the keys, but they aren't in one place. What would be the use of multisig addresses if all the keys are in one wallet?\n\nIn my scenario you could ask a customer for a transaction id, but it does make it more complicated than just asking them to make a deposit to a bitcoin address as normally is done.\n\nThanks for pointing out the batch rpc calls, I didn't think of that. I think the best thing to do would be to add a new flag to `addmultisigaddress` that will set the new `ismine` flag that you are talking about to true and then `listtransactions`, `listsince`, etc will show them\n",
