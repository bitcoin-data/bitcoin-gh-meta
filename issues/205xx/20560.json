   "body" : "Currently the linker is invoked more than 150 times when compiling with `--enable-fuzz`. This is problematic for several reasons:\r\n\r\n* It wastes disk space north of 20 GB, as all libraries and sanitizers are linked more than 150 times\r\n* It wastes CPU time, as the link step can practically not be cached (similar to ccache for object files)\r\n* It makes it a blocker to compile the fuzz tests by default for non-fuzz builds #19388, for the aforementioned reasons\r\n* The build file is several thousand lines of code, without doing anything meaningful except listing each fuzz target in a highly verbose manner\r\n* It makes writing new fuzz tests unnecessarily hard, as build system knowledge is required; Compare that to boost unit tests, which can be added by simply editing an existing cpp file\r\n* It encourages fuzz tests that re-use the `buffer` or assume the `buffer` to be concatenations of seeds, which increases complexity of seeds and complexity for the fuzz engine to explore; Thus reducing the effectiveness of the affected fuzz targets\r\n\r\nFixes #20088 ",
