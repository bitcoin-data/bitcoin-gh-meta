   "body" : "Dear Developers,\r\n\r\nDo you fine people plan on adding a GUI to Bitcoin Core so that users can create a PSBT and  also sign a PSBT for cold storage users? I would love this feature!!!!! I think you can do this with command line but it's risky and not simple. I ask because I only use Bitcoin Core as my wallet and don't have easy cold storage spending method without bringing all online.\r\n\r\nThank you and I love you all!\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nNo\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nan easy to use GUI to create a PSBT and to sign a PSBT for cold storage.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n",
