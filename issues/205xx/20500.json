For example, it seems FetchCoin uses emplace but does a piecewise_construct however it can be replaced with try_emplace:\r\n\r\n`CCoinsMap::iterator ret = cacheCoins.emplace(std::piecewise_construct, std::forward_as_tuple(outpoint), std::forward_as_tuple(std::move(tmp))).first;`\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n`\r\nCCoinsMap::iterator ret = cacheCoins.try_emplace(outpoint, std::move(tmp)).first;`\r\n\r\nI also noticed emplace was used on dir_locks which is a map to unique_ptrs which is generally discouraged. It is used [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5a6f3c5a01eaf904c42bd77dbed931b49a8fec74/src/util/system.cpp#L107) and should likely just look like this:\r\n\r\n`dir_locks[pathLockFile.string()] = std::move(lock));`",
