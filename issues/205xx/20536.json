   "body" : "Currently the `Transaction too large` is calculated on the transaction that is returned from `CreateTransaction`. This does not make sense for when `CreateTransaction` is being used for `fundrawtransaction` as no signing occurs so the final returned transaction is missing signatures. Thus users may successfully fund a transaction but fail to broadcast it after it has been fully signed.\r\n\r\nSo instead we should figure out whether the transaction we are funding will be too large after it is signed. We can do this by having `CalculateMaximumSignedTxSize` also return the transaction weight and then comparing that weight against the maximum weight.",
