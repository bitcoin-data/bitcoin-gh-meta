   "body" : "Similar to what #16373 did for `bumpfee`, this PR lets  `sendmany` and `sendtoaddress` return a PSBT for wallets without private keys:\r\n\r\n```\r\nResult:\r\n\"txid\"                  (string) The transaction id.\r\n{\r\n  \"psbt\":    \"psbt\"      (string) The base64-encoded unsigned PSBT of the new transaction. Only returned when wallet private keys are disabled.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI consolidated code between these two RPC calls, since `sendtoaddress` is essentially `sendmany` with 1 destination. Unless I overlooked something, the only behaviour change is that some `sendtoaddress` error codes changed from `-4` to `-6`. The release note mentions this.\r\n\r\nThe PSBT code is prepared for hardware wallet support (e.g. #16546). It checks if the PSBT is complete, which currently can't happen with watch-only wallets.\r\n\r\nCloses #18180. Depends on #18115.",
