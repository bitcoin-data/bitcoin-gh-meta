   "body" : "Following discussion in #18205, this PR adds a warning against re-use of the same wallet file on two different nodes, as that can cause problems due to race conditions between nodes (eg: both nodes using the same addresses at the same time for different things because they are not aware of the other node).\r\n\r\nI've also included the rationale behind the warning but I've kept it short to make it clearer to users, not sure if I should have written a longer explanation instead.\r\n\r\nAlso, while this PR may help some users avoid problems, the changes are largely inconsequential, so feel free to close it if it's not worth the effort.\r\n\r\nOn an unrelated note, I've also set up [this site](https://corollari.github.io/bitcoin-core-docs/), which periodically pulls bitcoin core and turns its docs into a webpage. Browsing the docs can also be done locally or on github, so this doesn't add much value, but I personally find that more comfortable and it makes them more searchable.",
