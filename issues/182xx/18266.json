   "body" : "It was [suggested](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18249#issuecomment-593944985) that we could have an additional argument for the [functional test_runner](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/test_runner.py) that modifies the timeouts by some factor. This would save having to randomly bump timeouts in the tests themselves, as users that require longer timeouts can opt in by `-factor=1.5` etc. \r\n\r\nFollow up to #18249.\r\n\r\n#### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this.
