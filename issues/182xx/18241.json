   "body" : "A lot of places refer to `CWallet*`'s as `CWallet * const`, which translates to *\"an immutable pointer to a mutable `CWallet` instance\"*; this is\r\n\r\n1. often not what the author meant, especially as a lot of these places do not at all modify the wallet object, and\r\n2. confusing, as it tends to suggest that this is a proper way to refer to a constant `CWallet` instance.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes references to wallets to `const CWallet* const` whenever immutability is expected. This should result in no behavioral changes at all, and improved compile-time error checking.\r\n\r\nNote from irc:\r\n\r\n> &lt;sipa&gt; sounds good to me; this is the sort of change that as long as it compiles, the behavior shouldn't change\r\n> &lt;sipa&gt; though in general it may lead to introducing automatic copying of objects sometimes (e.g. trying to std::move a const object will work, but generally result in a copy rather than an efficient move)\r\n> &lt;sipa&gt; CWallet objects aren't copied or moved though\r\n",
