New wallets can use the new version and old wallets can be upgraded by the user after educating them it might take a day.",

I'm not sure I understand.\r\n\r\nBIP 157 explains how the filters can be fetched over a P2P connection. Currently, BIP 157 uses one byte to uniquely identify the filter type. The bits in the byte are currently not interpreted separately. Also, to make it possible for wallets that depend on the BIP 158 filter type, nodes supporting it will set a service bit.\r\n\r\nSince there are already nodes running BIP 157+158, it is not trivial to just add a new filter type to the existing BIPs. It might be required to write a new BIP for the new filter type and signal it on a new service bit.\r\n\r\nHowever, introducing a bunch of new filter types (e.g. each script type for each segwit version) needs to be weighted against the downsides (cost of service bit, cost on full nodes to create the index).\r\n\r\nAgain, it would be useful to know why the existing BIP 158 filters (that work on the raw scriptPubKey, thus work for any segwit version and script type) are not sufficient for Wasabi's use case.",

In that case I'm fine with adding `p2wphk`, though I agree with @MarcoFalke that it doesn't seem very useful at first glance, especially without pruning.\r\n\r\nBitcoin DNS seeds announce which services are supported by nodes, and they allow querying for specific features, e.g. only nodes that serve block filters: https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin-seeder/pull/77/files (try `dig -t A x49.seed.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl`).\r\n\r\nIf there's plethora of different block filters out there, then either nodes have to play a trial and error game based on everything returned by `x49`, or we have to introduce additional P2P flags, that the DNS seeds can then filter. Either way doesn't really scale to more than a small number of filters. That's in additional to the privacy drawback, because which block filter(s) a wallet asks or a node offers tells something.\r\n\r\nBeing able to combine filters doesn't solve the above problems, though tailer made filters may be useful for a local wallet talking to a local node. Under the hood and at the RPC level we could have more fine grained filters like you suggest in #18221, but at the p2p level I suggest serving a very limited set.",

Back then this is how I implemented Hidden Wallet (predecessor of Wasabi) but in Wasabi I dropped the concept because others were bringing up privacy concerns. I personally don't think there are any leaks that wouldn't be just nitpicking, yet I dropped the concept in Wasabi with the thinking P2PWPKH filters from SegWit activation will just be fine to create a light wallet feeling and hopefully the filters' size will grow slower than the tech improves and if not then we implement it.  \r\nAt this point I don't feel like implementing it again as long as there is a chance for having a new filter type, but if it is rejected, that could be a way forward.\r\n\r\n@Sjors to answer for your very first question. The `P2WPKH` vs `P2WPKH+P2WSH` filter sizes are `249MB` vs `251MB`.\r\n\r\n@schildbach that'd be awesome if there'd be a mobile wallet that uses client side filters. Finally a mobile wallet I could recommend for privacy!\r\n\r\n@dangershony It seems to be there's a consensus here that `P2WPKH+P2WSH` filters is preferable over `P2WPKH` filters, would you mind updating your PR?",

      "body" : "Given that the `basic` type has a BIP ([158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki)) this one should as well. I suggest proposing a service bit for it, but see how that discussion goes. Perhaps it's overkill to have a service bit for a filter that, with increasing SegWit adoption over time, only offers a short term benefit. But if the filter is only used locally by a wallet, then it's not worth a BIP. Maybe the service bit can have a sunset block.\r\n\r\nYou should post the v0 filter BIP on the list as a separate thread from the filter combinations discussion, even though of course they are interlinked because of the service bit.\r\n\r\nIn your PR you use the same `M = 784931, P = 19` params as the basic filter. BIP158 says:\r\n\r\n> Empirical analysis also shows that was chosen as these parameters minimize the bandwidth utilized, considering both the expected number of blocks downloaded due to false positives and the size of the filters themselves\r\n\r\nBut it sadly doesn't link to said analysis. That's food some some mailinglist discussion. The right numbers might depend on SegWit adoption, but we can't predict that, so may it's not a factor. But SegWit v0 transactions also have different typical input and output sizes; I don't know if that matters.",

If e.g. 90% of txns were native SegWit, it should not matter much wether you're using the `basic` filter (which covers everything) or \"just\" the `P2WPKH` filter (which I assume would then only be ~10% smaller).\r\n\r\nIf I'm right with the above, I would suggest to consider specialized filters only as temporary and _not_ allocate any scarce resources (technical debt?) to it.",
