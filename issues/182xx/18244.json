   "body" : "When using `fundrawtransaction` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt` with `lockUnspents`, it would only lock automatically selected coins, not manually selected coins. That doesn't make much sense to me if the goal is to prevent accidentally double-spending yourself before you broadcast a transaction.\r\n\r\nNote that when  creating a transaction, manually selected coins are automatic \"unlocked\" (or more accurately: the lock is ignored). Earlier versions of this PR introduced an error when a locked coin is manually selected, but this idea was abandoned after some discussion. An application that uses this RPC should either rely on automatic coin selection (with `lockUnspents`) or handle lock concurrency itself with manual coin selection. In particular it needs to make sure to avoid/pause calls with automatic coin selection between calling `lockunspent` and the subsequent spending RPC.    \r\n\r\nSee #7518 for historical background.\r\n",
