   "body" : "Right now we're extracting this information from Bitcoin Core with a clever algorithm that considers the returned `blocks` (there's a bug there btw: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15001), converts the result to s/b and rounds up to integer and asks `estimatesmartfee` between two upper and smaller values and results in a dictionary with the\r\n- key: fee target\r\n- value: integer satoshi/vbyte\r\n\r\nThis reduces the whole spectrum of 2-1008 feetargets to only a couple of entries today:  \r\n\r\nhttps://wasabiwallet.io/api/v2/btc/Blockchain/all-fees?estimateSmartFeeMode=CONSERVATIVE\r\n\r\nhttps://wasabiwallet.io/api/v2/btc/Blockchain/all-fees?estimateSmartFeeMode=ECONOMICAL\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9156103/50340266-98103b80-051a-11e9-9632-6be79183b690.png)\r\n\r\nOf course the worst case scenario we'd have to do 1007 `estimatesmartfee` query, but today our algorithm is able to establish this dictionary with only about 12.\r\n\r\nWith this we are able to show a more accurate pre-transaction build fee estimation than other wallets, who're blindly targeting one or two RPC targets and doesn't try to explore that if the same fee can apply to less targets, thus giving back less accurate feedback to the users, like the user targets 2 weeks, but the tx still confirms within 6 hours.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, it's no biggie, but it would be nice if we could reduce our RPC queries to only one, if Core would give back the \"allfees\" with just one request. Maybe an `estimateallsmartfee CONSERVATIVE/ECONOMICAL` RPC would be a good idea. Thoughts?",
