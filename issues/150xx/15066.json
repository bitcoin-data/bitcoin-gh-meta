So far so good, bitcoind allocates ~800MB of ram which fits nicely into the pi's 1gb ram. I see the cache size grow as the node consumes blocks, but once cache is full, 2 strange things happen:\r\n\r\n1. cache size drops to zero and starts building up again. What I expect the system to do is pruning old cache entries by age or LRU or whatever, so the cache size stays roughly at max. I can see average block processing times raise from <10sec when cache is nearly full to ~20sec when cache is emptied and builds up again.\r\n\r\n2. Dropping the cache takes ~4min in which no blocks are processed. Why is that? dropping an in memory index and creating a new empty one should take milliseconds at best. Or is there more going on? However, there should be no drops at all in the first place imho.\r\n\r\nI made a pastebin of my debug.log entries (debug=1) at the time of the last 2 blocks where cache is building up to max size and the following 2 blocks after cache starts to rebuild again: https://pastebin.com/Z38MmgXj Can anyone enlighten me what and why this is happening?\r\n\r\nAdditional Info:\r\ndeamon starting command line: /usr/local/bin/bitcoind -conf=/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf -pid=/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoind.pid\r\n\r\nand bitcoin.conf:\r\ndaemon=1\r\nlogips=1\r\nmaxconnections=40\r\nmaxuploadtarget=5000\r\ntxindex=1\r\nrest=1\r\nserver=1\r\nwalletrbf=1\r\ndbcache=100",
