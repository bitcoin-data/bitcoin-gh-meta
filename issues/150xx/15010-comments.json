And that you be able to adjust the threshold for confirmed and turn the trusted-in-mempool-zeroconf on and off. And if you make the confirmed=0, it should still only count in-mempool\r\n\r\nIt seems like this PR is addressing the problem in a different way. Instead of treating not fully confirmed spends from the wallet as trusted (and therefore including change in the balance), it is treating not fully confirmed spends as actually unspent (and therefore including the whole output value in the balance)?\r\n\r\nIt's possible I'm confused, but it would help if there was an explanation of how this fix relates to previous discussion (or doesn't relate, if it is just a tangential bugfix).",

From that PR:\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, CWallet::GetBalance (the trusted-only implementation) did not support setting a min_conf parameter. This was added in #13566, but only checked min_conf for UTXO creation, not UTXO spending.\r\n\r\nI don't understand Luke's assertion that the getbalance value should be 9.99 and -10.01. Displaying negative balance doesn't make sense to me.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour should now be that when calling `getbalance` with a minconf value:\r\n- coins that have received but have fewer than minconf confirmations are excluded\r\n- coins that have been spent but have fewer than minconf confirmations are included\r\n\r\nEffectively, this gives the balance at (TIP - minconf) height.\r\n\r\nThat behaviour makes sense to me, and I think best reflects the description in the RPC help for minconf: \"Only include transactions confirmed at least this many times.\" It was what I understood commit 1ac717f8d836b16d5cb808c07f0578a309f4e9d0 in #14602 was attempting.\r\n\r\nIf people disagree that this is the desired behaviour, then I can amend or close this PR.

Any alternative definition (eg the amount of UTXOs that I can sign for less those UTXOs where I have evidence they can be spent, etc) leads to confusing inconsistencies like the example above.",

Perhaps that's a bit of a legalistic answer, but the only thing that brings us sureness in Bitcoin is confirmations. Talking about a balance outside of confirmed transactions is dangerous in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThat's fair. I didn't specify the assumptions I was making with my suggested implementation. It would give the balance assuming you only created normal transactions with the bitcoin wallet and didn't broadcast conflicting transactions, or export your keys somewhere, etc. It would be possible to do more work and come up with an implementation that made fewer assumptions (like only assuming that the wallet knows about conflicting transactions, not that they were never broadcast) to produce a more useful `minconf` balance, but this may also be too dangerous, or just not worth the effort to implement.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I don't think there is an argument for `minconf` to be interpreted the way this PR currently interprets it, which is like a request for an old balance from a point in history. So I might suggest closing this PR. Or if you think this behavior is useful, it might be better to expose it as a new RPC like `gethistoricbalance` and take a height argument rather than a depth argument.\r\n\r\nBut I guess I still would be curious if @sipa has a different answer to your questions from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15010#issuecomment-476857724.\r\n\r\nAlso, I was surprised to see the conclusion the last time this topic was discussed in IRC (http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2018-11-29.html#l-596), since it seems like it is basically just requesting the current getbalance(minconf=0) behavior:\r\n\r\n> \\<gmaxwell> Right, I think the desired behavior is that balances shows confirmed + trusted-in-mempool-0conf\r\n\r\nBut it was also interesting to read because there are other potential getbalance improvements discussed there.",
