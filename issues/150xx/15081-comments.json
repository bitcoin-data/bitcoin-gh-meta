If I do remove anything, I'll be sure that it's documented at least on the current stable branch.\r\n\r\nSomewhat related, I was wondering if it'd be useful to tag each item in the release note with the PR or PRs that went into it so that interested readers can learn more about the context.  If I do that, it ought to at least make it easier to grep whether the release notes contain any text about a backport of PRxxxxx.",
