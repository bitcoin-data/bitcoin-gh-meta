   "body" : "This PR adds new **assert_** methods to `functional/test_framework/util.py`:\r\n\r\n* *assert_not_equal*\r\n* *assert_less_than*\r\n* *assert_less_than_or_equal*\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `example_test.py` got a new method `test_asserts` to showcase them. I have searched for **test-the-test**-showcases but couldn't find any, hence the expansion of `example_test.py`\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this PR is based on my own experience with writing functional tests. From time to time I ran into situations where I wanted to test for something that **is not equal X** or **less than X**, but as only *assert_equal* respective *assert_greater_than* were available, I had to *negate expressions* first, before testing them with available asserts:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert_equal(negated_expression, False)\r\nassert_equal(greater_than_expression, False)\r\n```\r\n",
