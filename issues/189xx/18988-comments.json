Reducing state is less error-prone.\r\n\r\n@icota Do you have in mind a different ipv4/ipv6 flow that the one implemented by main net ? Path-aware routing could be cool and definitely something belonging there. ",

I will need some more time to have implementation comments, but will try to think about this in the context of the alt net I'm most familiar with (stateless unlicensed UHF Mesh / goTenna). Some preliminary big picture thoughts:\r\n\r\n 1) should the Watchdog functionality eventually be broken out as its own RFC? even without an altnet transport wouldn't a core wallet also want notification of unusual p2p events?\r\n\r\n 2) Right now core is aware of [ASN buckets](https://bitcoincore.reviews/16702.html), do think different altnet connections could be treated as diverse ASNs?\r\n 2a) Should altnet peers be treated as one ASN, or is there a way to ensure diversity to protect against sybil altnet peers.\r\n\r\n 3) Do you envision a plugin-driver model so that core would support the high level CDriver/Watchdog, but people could plug-in their own low-level implementations? \r\n 3a) In the case of goTenna, we have a low-level C driver that is not open source so would not be appropriate to include in core. Would something like the HWI system make sense for different vender specfic CDriver instances?\r\n\r\n 4) A deeper integration to make altnet peers 1st class peers would be difficult, but if a CNetAddr worked more like a URI then peers could be stored as ip:\\\\ipaddress:port and altnet nodes would look like clightning:\\\\peeraddr and use an altnet CDriver named `clightning`.\r\n 4a) A less invasive approach to 1st class would be that any altnet peer just uses 127.0.0.1:cdriver_port, but all peers can include user configurable transport capabilities.\r\n\r\nGreat work, I'm really excited to try this out.\r\n",

Obviously stuff that can be done with no additional requirements (additional requirements could be a proxy, another daemon or even new hardware like an antenna) and that is a clear benefit to Bitcoin Core can live inside of Bitcoin Core. For example something like the existing `TipMayBeStale` logic.\r\n\r\nHowever, for transports that would pull in additional dependencies, a more flexible approach would be to define a common interface. The drivers could then ask Bitcoin Core for raw validation data and statistics, then reply with new headers or blocks. For example, this could be done over the RPC interface. I haven't thought about all the trade-offs, but it seems beneficial if addons can be attached and removed during run-time as well as being developed independently of the Bitcoin Core development process?",

I can foresee `bitcoin-cli ioctl bluetooth --label=tx,headers`, you're envisioning something like this ?\r\n\r\n> In the case that your node might have a metered main connection e.g. 3G along with a secondary transport mechanism, the same prioritisation might be able to help split bandwidth required between multiple transports simultaneously.\r\n\r\nAh thanks didn't think about this, effectively when bandwidth has been consumed on one device you may want to fallback on another one. I do think bandwidth tracking should be done drivers-side.\r\n\r\n> For the low bandwidth/metered scenario, I feel this would be an excellent match for the compressed block headers scheme I picked up on in my email here.\r\n\r\nYes IIRC compressed block headers in the linked issue (#18989). Clearly that would be easier to innovate on message protocol, like also transaction compression.",

Would something like the HWI system make sense for different vender specfic CDriver instances?as its own RFC? even without an altnet transport wouldn't a core wallet also want notification of unusual p2p events?\r\n\r\nYes Watchdog has its own PR (#18987), with a `CWatchdogInterface`. It could be used by any kind of application, including the wallet.\r\n\r\n> Right now core is aware of ASN buckets, do think different altnet connections could be treated as diverse ASNs?\r\n2a) Should altnet peers be treated as one ASN, or is there a way to ensure diversity to protect against sybil altnet peers.\r\n\r\nI would like to avoid dealing with ASN/IP address at all. If you assume wireless communications there is no ASN to deal with, peer discovery and policy should be inside the driver. With regards to peer, you may only need a general way to authenticate them, so maybe some driver method enumerating its hosted peers ?\r\n\r\n> Do you envision a plugin-driver model so that core would support the high level CDriver/Watchdog, but people could plug-in their own low-level implementations?\r\n3a) In the case of goTenna, we have a low-level C driver that is not open source so would not be appropriate to include in core. Would something like the HWI system make sense for different vender specfic CDriver instances?\r\n\r\nI clearly envision a plugin-driver model and exactly core would support the high-level `CDriver/`CWatchdog`/`AtLogicValidation`. I lean to something like HWI and drivers implementations being hosted outside of core, under bitcoin-core/ for the open-sources ones. With regards to proprietary, I don't have opinion, if they bind to the interface that's better for you I guess.\r\n\r\n> A deeper integration to make altnet peers 1st class peers would be difficult, but if a CNetAddr worked more like a URI then peers could be stored as ip:\\ipaddress:port and altnet nodes would look like clightning:\\peeraddr and use an altnet CDriver named clightning.\r\n4a) A less invasive approach to 1st class would be that any altnet peer just uses 127.0.0.1:cdriver_port, but all peers can include user configurable transport capabilities.\r\n\r\nI don't want to interfere with the actual p2p stack. But if what you want to address is user configurable transport capabilities that can be done at the rpc-level and yes something like `bitcoin-cli ioctl Wifi:XXX --label=tx,addr` ?\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback!",

I don't think drivers should ask for raw validation data on their own, i.e you may receive your block from actual p2p but want to broadcast it over WiFi. Drivers acting on their own means you poll a lot for nothing due to block variance, and that's what RPC doesn't fit IMO. Haven't thought that much about run-time addition but I completely agree to not encumber Bitcoin Core development process more. You provide a generic framework and drivers devs can work on their own in another repo.",

But one thing that's missing and would be nice would be a plan for how this might be rolled out. I'm assuming we wouldn't add a new framework before anything was using it, and I know Matt has already implemented a lot of things that could use this framework. So it'd be great if there was a writeup (or outline like the [assumeutxo plan](https://github.com/jamesob/assumeutxo-docs/tree/2019-04-proposal/proposal#plan)) saying what the steps could be for rolling this out, and linking to Matt's implementations, and saying how things could be integrated. The [dev wiki](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki) could be a good place to put this, since it would be speculative and subject to change.\r\n\r\nOn the PR itself, I know it is exploratory and you don't expect it to be merged, but was hard not to notice it was copying and pasting a lot of existing code from net/net_processing/validationinteface code and also introducing new code following older conventions (`CPrefixedClassNames` `bHungarianVariables`), so I just want to quickly encourage using the current [style](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#coding-style-c) in new code and trying to avoid duplicate implementations of things like [`WatchSignalsInstance`](https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/blob/3667d18a76f72acf0741a886715b6c9fee40001d/src/watchdoginterface.cpp#L14) / [`MainSignalsInstance`](https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/blob/3667d18a76f72acf0741a886715b6c9fee40001d/src/validationinterface.cpp#L26) in the real version of this.",

Let alone something like DNS which doesn't even have a file descriptor, only a libc call to poll.\r\n\r\nI think message translation from a wire format suiting communication channel should be done by the driver, it doesn't make sense at all to make it in the framework. So we may pass `NetMsgType` to the driver interface without caring further.\r\n\r\nWith regards to threading right, but isn't the case in main stack we have a separation between `ThreadSocketHandler` and `ThreadMessageHandler` for performance reasons ?

But one reason the implementation avoids stdin/stdout is that it makes printf debugging awkward, and one stray printf or `-printtoconsole` anywhere in the codebase messes up the IPC connection.\r\n\r\nAlso as mentioned https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18988#issuecomment-642731876, with [01c31f9](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/01c31f9dcd15c1009c4b69e820fc0c01b73cd3c9) from branch [ryanofsky@`ipc-export`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/ipc-export), you can connect to an already running `bitcoin-node` through a `<datadir>/sockets/node.sock` socket, which is probably what you would want to do as an external application, rather than starting a bitcoin process.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you're trying to do though, since I'm not really sure what information's relevant here.",

No need to mess with #19160 (multiprocess pr) if the altnet driver is written in c++ or can be part of bitcoin core, but you might use #19160 if you want to write the altnet driver in a different language or more independently of the bitcoin core codebase.\r\n3. Maybe switch from socks5/torcontrol to a custom protocol for bitcoind <--> node-Tor communication. If socks5/torcontrol don't fit well into the altnet framework, maybe do this at the same time as writing the altnet driver.",

Maybe it would be good to create a specific issue to discuss this here or in the node-Tor github repo.\r\n\r\nThanks, probably @ariard can tell us if this discussion should be moved to other places, I don't find it uninteresting to compare the different approaches\r\n\r\nnode-Tor does support the socks interface since the very beginning but I don't see the point of using a potentially vulnerable localhost and weak socks protocol for processes that are running on the same machine, we saw not a long time ago that it could lead to security breaches for bitcoin\r\n\r\nThe Tor project (which is designed for browsing) does not really have the choice today (also for Snowflake), for node-Tor I just don't want to use it, and just don't need it, because browsers for example are not browsing anything but acting as Tor protocol relays/nodes (paradoxically they can't browse anything via WebRTC/WS/xhr interfaces)\r\n\r\nSo I think that a better approach is pluggable layers with altnet that can be chained including unix sockets and including browser interfaces\r\n\r\nWhat I am proposing can look \"ambitious/disruptive or whatever\" but I am not far from it and those ideas are not just from yesterday, it's just a matter of time to do it and that's just a part of the Convergence project, 3 with unix sockets looks to be the right option for a universal nodejs driver (not talking about a specific driver for node-Tor, it should work for other nodejs programs), writing it myself... most likely no, I could do it but I can't pretend to be a C/C++ expert for whom it should probably be a piece of cake to do it\r\n",
