You record a failure once, then debug the recording, deterministically, as many times as you want. The same execution is replayed every time. -- https://rr-project.org/\r\n\r\n> Chaos mode to make intermittent bugs more reproducible. -- https://robert.ocallahan.org/2016/02/introducing-rr-chaos-mode.html\r\n\r\nPersonally I think `rr` is a **fantastic** piece of software which is right up there with projects such as `libFuzzer` and the sanitizers (ASan, MSan, TSan, UBSan) when it comes to its potential to help us produce robust and secure software. Highly recommended!",
