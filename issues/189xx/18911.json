   "body" : "#16003 has been closed, and I've pulled out the unrelated p2p change. However I think it's worth someone following up and taking a look at our startup file descriptor accounting. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned in #16003, if `bitcoind` is started somewhere that the maximum number of open file descriptors is limited, we can run into some nonsensical behaviour. Such as a \"negative\" number of maximum connections:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# using bash\r\nulimit -n 150\r\nsrc/bitcoind\r\n[init] Using at most -8 automatic connections (150 file descriptors available)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's also impossible to shutdown `bitcoind` from this state as the `opencon` thread will never exit.\r\n\r\nIt would be good for someone to look through this code, document assumptions, and fix issues like the above.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this. You are encouraged to comment on the issue if you are planning to work on it. This will help other contributors monitor which issues are actively being addressed and is also an effective way to request assistance if and when you need it.\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",
