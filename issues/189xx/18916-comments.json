Description of current code was surprisingly fun to read, and in your plans I see you're focusing on the blob storage layer so #18608 is orthogonal. Only feedback on the gist is I'm not sure what you get out of combining the Database & Batch classes (obviously the Environment class is a Berkeley specific detail and should go away or be hidden in the bdb implementation). But I guess having just Database objects without Batch objects is not a problem, as nothing in the wallet really relies on atomic writes.",

      "body" : "> It is? Why?\r\n\r\nI think there are three primary reasons to move off of BDB.\r\n\r\n1. It does not fit our use case and there are still some issues with potential corruption and data loss.\r\n\r\nBDB seems to be more designed for large, multithreaded and multiprocess applications with multiple things trying to access the database at once. It isn't designed to be a single portable application file format like we are trying to do with the wallet file. It isn't designed for the idea of having a single file. This means that for us to achieve this goal, we are constantly flushing and have to have workarounds to achieve this goal. It would be better if we could use something that is designed to be a single portable application file format.\r\n\r\nEven with all of the workarounds that we do, there are still some issues with flushing (albeit in very edge cases). An example of this came up in #18844 which tried to bump BDB to 5.3. There, the `feature_backwards_compatibility.py` test was copying a wallet.dat file to be opened in a previous release, but without unloading the wallet file. What happened was that even though we have aggressive flushing, not all the changes were actually being flushed to the wallet.dat file. So the wallet.dat file that was copied didn't actually have the correct data written to it before being loaded into the previous release. Because the log files were not compatible, the logs which contained what had actually been written were being removed so none of the data ended up being persisted and readable by the previous release. This is, of course, data loss and also resulted in the test failing. While this is an edge case that we can't see in a release, it just shows how BDB doesn't fit our usage.\r\n\r\n2. Because we are trying to use it in a way it perhaps wasn't intended to be used, we have tons of workarounds and magic that makes the code developer unfriendly and scary to touch\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the way that we use BDB is very fragile. Changing the implementation would probably result in a regression. This makes it difficult to improve and change things. It's just workarounds on workarounds on workarounds which makes it a scary thing to even consider touching. I don't think we should have stuff like that in the codebase. We shouldn't be have something that a refactor could accidentally introduce a regression that is both hard to test and debug. The complexity of our implementation seems to be largely due to the workarounds that we have in place to try to make BDB do what we want it to do.\r\n\r\nFor example, in trying to refactor the storage code so that we can support other storage backends, I've somehow [caused travis to fail](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18971#issuecomment-632235166) even though the refactor shouldn't be changing behavior and is largely a bunch of moves.\r\n\r\n3. It's old, unsupported, and unmaintained.\r\n\r\nSome people argue that this is a good thing because it's a stable API and that moving to something that is maintained would mean we risk having changing APIs and behavior changing unexpectedly. But we can simply pin to a specific version of whatever library and get the same thing. But I think that being able to use up to date and maintained versions of a library is a good thing. The fact that BDB 4.8 is now over 10 years old should itself be something to consider. Additionally, we have to apply patches to BDB just to make it compile in the depends system with C++11. I can only imagine that this will get worse as C++ and compilers change. I would rather we use a library that has the requisite changes to work with modern libraries and has had testing to ensure that the behavior is still the same.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAs for why SQLite specifically, it is designed for our use case (application file format is an advertised use case of SQLite) and makes the workarounds that we have had with BDB unnecessary. I've already done most of the implementation of a SQLite storage backend and it's much simpler and easier to follow than the BDB stuff. Because SQLite does not require the use of a database environment like BDB does, and it does not use a shared cache by default, we don't need the workarounds of separate directories and unique fileids that we currently use for BDB. This itself would reduce a lot of complexity.\r\n\r\nBecause SQLite doesn't use a persistent log file, we don't have the issue of users forgetting log files when copying their wallets. The log files that SQLite generates are cleaned up after each transaction. This means that once everything is flushed, it all ends up in the database file, not just in the log file as BDB does. There is additionally no need for force flushing or periodic flushing. This would let us remove a scheduler thread for periodic flushes when we remove BDB. The edge case I mentioned above would no longer be an issue as once SQLite says the data is written, it is actually written to the database file, not the log file. So copying a wallet file while it is still in use, while still not recommended, wouldn't result in data loss.\r\n\r\nAnd of course SQLite is still maintained with the code released in the public domain so Licensing shouldn't be an issue for us as it was with BDB.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWhile we would still need to keep BDB around for a while after introducing and switching to a new database system, we can still allow for migration without needing to have BDB. I've done some digging into the database file format and it's actually fairly simple. We could implement our own BDB file deserializer and just pull the key/value pairs from the file directly and then import them into whatever new database we use. I've even implemented such a deserializer in python for tests in #18836. So we can still do migrations without needing BDB. BDB would only be necessary if we want to continue allowing people to keep using old wallet files without migrating.",

I don't think anyone actually took the time to confirm if those are false positives are actual issues. However, the general workflow when running bitcoin core with sanitizers enabled is to disable the wallet. In light of the database corruptions we see in wallets, I wouldn't be surprised if this was caused by bdb itself and not necessarily bad hardware. Just three recent issues from the last two weeks for reference: #19034, #19036 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18944#issuecomment-628693778. Someone should probably go back further than two weeks to see if there are more wallet related issues that hint to file corruption.\r\n* Then there is the known issue that salvagewallet will throw away privkeys when it shouldn't. #7379 #7463  #10991 ...\r\n* Then the disk grinding issue, writing the whole wallet file every 2 seconds to disk. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7475#issuecomment-181188121 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2511#issuecomment-16251455 #10236  ...\r\n\r\nI am happy to dig out more bug reports, but as an illustration those should suffice.\r\n",

My feelings are mixed, but I support a move away from BerkeleyDB as Oracle's stewardship seems to be at odds with the goals for this software (read: AGPLv3 ain't going to work and no one is maintaining the last 5.x release or any previous release for that matter AFAIK).\r\n\r\nHistorically, as is the case here, most issues with BDB are due more to misunderstanding the API in one way or another.  Those are real bugs in that they are repeated by many developers (read: the API is complex, so hard to get right).  BerkeleyDB's locking subsystem is fantastic, but built when single core CPUs were the norm and cache lines we're not something one had to worry about.  WiredTiger, authored by primary engineers from Sleepycat after leaving post-acquisition, sorted this out using a different approach to coordination, but that library is also AGPLv3, so not an option.\r\n\r\nLMDB is about as close to a solid drop-in replacement for BDB as you can find today, Howard Chu will certainly back that up (he's vocal, but a super solid person/engineer).  Howard has spent time replicating the BDB API and includes features for transactions.  He's also used a locking approach that fundamentally works better (read: scales) on today's CPUs.  As he's using it in OpenLDAP, an 99/1 read/write workload, it should be very optimized for storage of the chain data which is also a very read-skewed workload.  I think it's used in Monero today for such things.\r\n\r\nSqlite is certainly an amazing piece of software, Dr Hipp and team are wonderful and talented people and their work has more than achieved critical mass and quality to be considered a solid replacement. I had the pleasure of working with him while at Oracle as we tried to port his SQL layer onto BerkeleyDB's BTREE and create a \"DBSQL\" product.\r\n\r\nThe use of LevelDB for other parts of this project makes me shudder a bit due to my time at Basho working on our fork of that codebase and my knowledge of its shortcomings when compared to LMDB, BerkeleyDB or its more mature fork: RocksDB.\r\n\r\nIf I were the decision maker in this regard I'd migrate this code away from LevelDB and BerkeleyDB to either:\r\na) LMDB for all the storage if SQL queries and relational storage isn't required, but only a \"nice to have\"\r\nb) LMDB or RocksDB where LevelDB is used today and Sqlite for the wallet if SQL is somehow a requirement\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me personally to chat or ignore me entirely, just thought I'd drop in and leave some friendly unsolicited advice. :)",

There has already been significant work put into implementing sqlite storage and the potential for incompatible data files with LMDB presents a significant challenge in convincing other contributors that it is suitable for use in the wallet (there was a long discussion about this on IRC several months ago when I first proposed switching off of BDB). Additionally, the wallet barely uses the database so performance isn't really a concern to us right now (everything is read into memory at loading time so there are basically no reads during normal operation. Writes happen fairly infrequently too).\r\n\r\nAt the very least, the way that we have restructured the database storage code in the wallet will let us introduce further database systems if we want to. So it shouldn't be that hard to add/switch to LMDB if we find that the performance is needed.",

      "body" : "@gburd @hyc Thank you both for chiming in!\r\n\r\nI feel perhaps this discussion is confusing the requirements for the wallet file vs. our other database uses (chainstate, indexes).\r\n\r\nFor the wallet:\r\n* Don't need performance. Right now, the entire wallet is effectively loaded in memory, and writes are rare. The everything-in-memory loading may change at some point, but even if that happens, it won't be for frequently-read things.\r\n* Backward compatibility. Wallet files often live years, can be restored from long-forgotten backups, ... which ideally Just Work(tm). For BDB this is effectively solved by fixing the library version used. Before that happened, the db_dump + db_load that was sometimes necessary actually caused problems.\r\n* Forward compatibility. To a lesser extent, people do sometimes downgrade software when some incompatibility with their setup was used.\r\n* Portability/convenience. Moving wallet files between systems does happen, even across architectures. The current hack we need where BDB's log files are erased on shutdown, and that it effectively means wallets are directories rather than single files is somewhat annoying.\r\n* Features. Currently the wallet is a dumb key/value store, but I believe @achow101 likes keeping the possibility open to use more advanced queries at some point.\r\n* Stability. Files are ideally resilient against hardware failures etc.\r\n\r\nI believe sqlite is a pretty good choice for all of this.\r\n\r\nThings are different for the chainstate and other application data, where performance is very important, and with the assumeutxo work we'll get the ability to serialize/deserialize chainstate data in a neutral dump format, reducing the need for cross-platform compatibility.\r\n\r\nI think LMDB and RocksDb are reasonable candidates to consider for this at some point.",

We have an open issue to port it to LMDB as well, because rewriting the entire file is proving to be unwieldy for users with large/busy wallets (e.g. exchanges). One key factor to consider here is that BDB supports page-level encryption, and there's an unreleased patch for LMDB that does also. The LMDB-based Monero wallet will be using this feature.\r\n\r\nNot to be too prejudicial, but I think you'll find that RocksDB is unworkable. Its memory/cache/tuning requirements are ridiculous, and its need for huge numbers of open file descriptors (same as LevelDB) is ludicrous for a process that already needs a large number of descriptors for network sockets.
