      "body" : "Practically, how should someone interested in this as a good first issue test the \"hypothesis is that the _right_ way to invoke `clang`\" is to invoke it directly? Just drop xcrun calls and verify the depends and bitcoin builds don't fail?\r\n\r\nOther thoughts:\r\n\r\n- This doesn't seem to be distinguishing between the `build_darwin_CC` etc variables used to build build dependencies and the `darwin_CC` etc variables used to build runtime dependencies. Previously I figured you could get away with not using the SDK for the build dependencies, but would have to use it for the runtime dependencies, especially qt.\r\n\r\n- For more background, Cory (@theuni) first suggested dropping xcrun  in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16367#issuecomment-595393546, and I think it got a little bit of testing with https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commit/04bec8d2844e0cd2e09a62b21b006292f33f8093 from that PR and the saga described https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18677#discussion_r410451676 ending in #18743\r\n\r\n- While it seems silly to keep xcrun calls if they aren't needed, it's also not obvious what advantages would be gained from dropping them if they are working now. (Could be worth expanding issue description if there are advantages this is looking for.)\r\n\r\n- There are other possibilities besides:\r\n\r\n  ```make\r\n  build_darwin_CC:=clang\r\n  build_darwin_CXX:=clang++\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  and\r\n\r\n  ```make\r\n  build_darwin_CC:=$(shell xcrun -f clang)\r\n  build_darwin_CXX:=$(shell xcrun -f clang++)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Another option would be to use the default system compiler, whether or not is clang:\r\n\r\n  ```make\r\n  build_darwin_CC:=cc\r\n  build_darwin_CXX:=c++\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Or just delete these lines, in which case I think they will default automatically to `cc` `c++` `ar` `nm` etc.",
