For example if something is out-of-scope for a pull request, but still should be done in the long term, a TODO seems appropriate. Especially when the TODO is clearly motivated and clearly explains how to fix it.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n* `boost::thread a; // TODO switch to C++11 std::thread, when possible`\r\n* `GetCounter(); // TODO add lock annotation when class has been updated to our annotated mutex` (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17443#discussion_r425656746)\r\n* ...\r\n\r\nThe advantage of inline TODO is that when the code gets removed or the TODO gets fixed, it will go away in the same commit. If it was filed as an issue, we'd have to walk the issue list and keep it in sync.\r\n\r\nHowever, for general, non actionable TODOs, an issue makes sense. For example \"increase encapsulation\" or \"increase performance with cache\".\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

One of the worst thing about our code is that that is is filled with thousands of nonsensical and nonideal things that everybody agrees are nonsensical and nonideal but nobody explains out of laziness or fear of expressing a \"[developer's opinion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18965#issuecomment-629078426)\". We need comments that talk about opinions and intentions and limitations of code. Code that is intended to be understood by humans should look like code that is written by humans, not drunk mute space aliens. It's great to file issues. But a developer guideline discouraging developers from describing their intentions in code is a WTF to me.\r\n\r\nIf the main concern here is causal contributors submitting PRs to \"fix\" todos in ways that aren't useful (which doesn't seem like it's been a problem, but could be a theoretical problem if there are more comments), this just seems like something that could be noted in the contributing guidelines. But I would point out that todo comments can and have lead to useful contributions in the past. Like the ongoing and evolving [TODO in interfaces/chain.h](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e2f6866cca3e0c3c74f94f2df50ed3243158ea32/src/interfaces/chain.h#L59) in has prompted [numerous useful wallet improvements from ariard](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=author%3Aariard+sort%3Acreated-asc)",

I can claim that Signet should be merged by May all I want, but that's not gonna change anything, and Signet isn't gonna go anywhere unless a bunch of people I have no control over decides to work towards that goal.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you still feel like this is WTF, I'm going to close this, but I honestly think you're on the wrong track.",
