      "body" : "Honestly, I've not been that far in the design of a specific hook interface servicing watchdog/statistical tools.\r\n\r\nThis PoC was relying on a `CWatchdogInterface` inspired from the current `CValidationInterface`. Though one of the prevailing feedback I received with this proposal was that it would be far better to have the module separated in another runtime, and even external to Bitcoin Core internals or build system. Thus letting _any_ module to be plugged in.\r\n\r\nOne solution I'm working on is pursuing on the work done by multiprocess with the newly introduced abstract interfaces (`src/interfaces`), where your potential external modules could be written in Rust to talk directly to core C++ code through Cap'n Proto or in the future another protocol (fyi, see https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/56).\r\n\r\nOf course, w.r.t to event collection, the USDT approach you're proposing sounds the right tool. One could imagine a watchdog module where the low-level event collection is gathered through tracing and the high-level corrective logic relying on a `*.capnp` interface, all bundled in the same runtime.\r\n\r\n> This could be done with the net tracepoints for inbound / outbound P2P messages. See this example https://bitcoind.observer/p2p-network-traffic and code https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoind-observer.\r\n\r\nI need to think more, but I think tracepoints could cover the whole range of proposed heuristics: local clock, packets RTT, peer rotation frequency, mempool feerate groups, ... ?\r\n\r\n> Let if you think this might be an alternative to a module in Bitcoin Core. Happy to chat.\r\n\r\nFirst impression, I think this tracepoint approach is far better than yet-another-non-critical-module in core for sure. Yeah happy to chat, on this PR, a new issue or irc :)",
