   "body" : "The data storage layer of the wallet is fairly complicated and not well encapsulated or modularized. This makes it difficult for us to introduce new data storage methods. So this PR refactors it such that there is a clear way to introduce other storage options. This is also intended to clean up the logic of the database layer so that it is easier to follow and reason about.\r\n\r\nIn the database, there are 3 classes: `BerkeleyBatch`, `BerkeleyDatabase`, and `BerkeleyEnvironment`. `BerkeleyDatabase` is typenamed to `WalletDatabase`. The goal is to introduce two abstract classes: `WalletDatabase` and `DatabaseBatch`. These will be implemented by `BerkeleyDatabase` and `BerkeleyBatch`. This abstract classes can be inherited by other storage methods. All of the database specific things should be hidden in those classes.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we move the database handling things in `BerkeleyBatch` and turn it purely into a data accessor for the `BerkeleyDatabase`. Particularly, various static functions that operated on a `BerkeleyDatabase` are changed to be member functions of `BerkeleyDatabase`. `Read`, `Write`, `Erase`, and `Exists` are refactored to have separate functions that can be overridden by other classes. Instead of `GetCursor` returning a BDB specific `Dbc` object, new `CreateCursor` and `CloseCursor` functions are added and the cursor is handled internally within the `BerkeleyBatch`. We are then able to introduce the `DatabaseBatch` abstract class.\r\n\r\nFunctionality is further moved out of `BerkeleyBatch` into `BerkeleyDatabase`. Notably the `Db` handle creation is moved from `BerkeleyBatch`'s constructor and to a new `Open` function in `BerkeleyDatabase`. `BerkeleyDatabase` will also handle closing with a new `Close` function instead of having this be part of `Flush`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the existence of `BerkeleyEnvironment` is hidden inside of `BerkeleyDatabase`. `mapFileUseCount` is removed. Instead `WalletDatabase` will track it's use count with `m_refcount`. This is incremented by newly introduced `AddRef` and `RemoveRef` functions. `m_refcount` is used to ensure that the database and environment are not closed while the database may still be in use.\r\n\r\nInstead of each `BerkeleyEnvironment` tracking the fileids of the databases in that environment, a global map `g_fileids` is used. Since we were already going through every open fileid for the uniqeness check, it doesn't matter what `BerkeleyEnvironment` has a database with a particular fileid. All we care about is that there is a database in any of the environments that has the same fileid of the database that is currently being opened.\r\n\r\nLastly, `BerkeleyBatch, `BerkeleyDatabase`, and `BerkeleyEnvironment` are moved into new files `wallet/bdb.{cpp/h}`. `WalletDatabase` and `DatabaseBatch` are in `wallet/db.{cpp/h}`. This just gives better organization of the code so they aren't all mixed together.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI've started breaking this down into separate PRs. Some of the simpler stuff is moved up to the front so they can be merged first.\r\n\r\n* [x] Mostly simple moveonly things: #19290\r\n  * walletdb: Make SpliWalletFilePath non-static\r\n  * walletdb: Add IsBDBWalletLoaded to look for BDB wallets specifically\r\n  * walletdb: move IsWalletLoaded to walletdb.cpp\r\n  * walletdb: moveonly: Move BerkeleyBatch Cursor and Txn funcs to cpp\r\n  * walletdb: Move BDB specific things into bdb.{cpp/h}\r\n\r\nThese PRs are independent of each other and can be merged out of order after #19290 is merged\r\n* [x] Refactor Read, Write, Erase, Exists: #19292\r\n  * walletdb: refactor Read, Write, Erase, and Exists into non-template func\r\n* [ ] Handle cursor internally: #19308\r\n  * walletdb: Handle cursor internally\r\n* [x] Make Create, CreateMock, and CreateDummy standalone: #19310\r\n  * Add Create*WalletDatabase functions\r\n  * scripted-diff: Replace WalletDatabase::Create* with CreateWalletDatabase\r\n  * Remove WalletDatabase::Create, CreateMock, and CreateDummy\r\n* [ ] Move BerkeleyBatch static functions: #19324\r\n  * walletdb: Combine VerifyDatabaseFile and VerifyEnvironment\r\n  * walletdb: Move PeriodicFlush into WalletDatabase\r\n  * walletdb: Move Rewrite into BerkeleyDatabase\r\n\r\nThese PRs require the previous listed to be merged first and need to be merged in order\r\n* [ ] Introduce `DatabaseBatch`: #19325\r\n  * walletdb: Refactor DatabaseBatch abstract class from BerkeleyBatch\r\n  * walletdb: Add MakeBatch function to BerkeleyDatabase and use it\r\n* [ ] Introduce `WalletDatabase`: #19334\r\n  * walletdb: Move BerkeleyDatabase::Flush(true) to Close()\r\n  * walletdb: Introduce AddRef and RemoveRef functions\r\n  * walletdb: Add BerkeleyDatabase::Open dummy function\r\n  * walletdb: Introduce WalletDatabase abstract class\r\n* [ ] Cleanup the separation: #19335\r\n  * walletdb: track database file use as m_refcount within BerkeleyDatabase\r\n  * walletdb: Move Db->open to BerkeleyDatabase::Open\r\n  * walletdb: Use a global g_fileids instead of m_fileids for each env\r\n  * walletdb: Remove BerkeleyBatch friend class from BerkeleyDatabase\r\n\r\nI will continue to break this down as things get merged.",
