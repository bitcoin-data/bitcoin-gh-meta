   "body" : "sync_blocks has been made a member of the test framework in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15773, but the global helper has been left intact for now.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested to move the implementation to the member function as well https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15773#pullrequestreview-224235071\r\n\r\nImplementing the functionality in a single place in the test framework allows the method to take account of contextual information, such as global timeout modifications. Also, having a global that does almost-but-not-quite the same thing is confusing for test writers and reviewers.\r\n\r\nSo the implementation should be moved, along with removing the global helper.\r\n\r\n#### Useful skills:\r\n\r\nPython3, basic understanding of the test framework\r\n\r\n#### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this. You are encouraged to comment on the issue if you are planning to work on it. This will help other contributors monitor which issues are actively being addressed and is also an effective way to request assistance if and when you need it.\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",
