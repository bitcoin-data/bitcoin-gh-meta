Also, I don't see how I can help by **not reacting** to issues. \r\n\r\nA mediocre coder, like I am, can help best by solving minor, unimportant issues, in my opinion. Or by reviewing other people's PR, that I also do. Or by writing some smaller scripts for automating things, like with Bitcoin Signet.\r\n\r\nSo, all in all, little unimportant things that I do in my ~quarantine~ spare time. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't dare interacting with complex PRs, because such behavior would only cost valuable time of others. \r\n\r\nBut if this is an issue, no problem, there are other open source projects. \r\n\r\nCheers.",

      "body" : "hi @brakmic\n\nIâm really sorry Iâve made you feel unwelcome. That was not at all my intent. Iâve found the bitcoin core project to be a welcoming place, and I strive to further that culture. It makes me sad that my words here have landed in an incendiary way.\n\nOpen source development is hard for a number of reasons. One is that we are all working on partial information. Recently, I had multiple individuals approach me looking for a way to onboard onto the project. My general advice is to them is to 1. familiarize with the tests,Â  2. start reviewing PRs & 3. look for good first issues. Iâve gotten the feedback that the good first issues are usually taken quickly after being posted, but I only have this perspective because of the direct communication, and donât expect that others would necessarily know that people are searching.\n\nThe intent of my comment was to share a perspective. Not to impose upon you what you should or shouldnât do, and definitely not to discourage you. As I originally said, I appreciate your enthusiasm to contribute to the project.\n\n@MarcoFalke thanks for your offer to help anyone interested find work to do. Thatâs awesome.\n\nTo all the contributors who have worked hard to make this project a welcoming environment, not just here, but in many other places - a heartfelt thank you. I wouldnât be here if it werenât for all of you.\n\nTo anybody reading this who might be considering working on Bitcoin- I hope itâs very clear that you are welcome here & there are many people interested in supporting your journey.",
