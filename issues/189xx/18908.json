   "body" : "This PR deliberately raises a *deadly signal* in system.cpp fuzzer while testing ArgsManager::ParseParameters. The motivation for this change is based on experiences from this PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18901\r\n\r\nAs the fuzzer provoked UB, I implemented a way to catch this error. However, after consultation with **elichai** and **sipa** I came to the conclusion that there was no proper solution in user-related code. The problem was to be fixed in the fuzzer itself. So, a simple `assert` got introduced to provoke a deadly signal when fuzzer walks over it.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please, check the discussion below.\r\n",
