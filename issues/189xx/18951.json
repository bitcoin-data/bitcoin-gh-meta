It reported that the receiving address also sent the coins.\r\n\r\nI can see in the testnet block explorer that transaction did in fact happen correctly. https://live.blockcypher.com/btc-testnet/tx/37e37cb8add45cc234f0d8f530ddd1346404be5da14a4ce125748dd13094aaea/\r\n\r\nI sent from\r\ntb1qutv5a8vxthm6rqgfjexzvz3p49fyls74hj4zzu -> tb1q0yempvk7fwqz2k9j6utkkkuyt7fqznqjwplkhu\r\n\r\nbut the  gettransaction() function is reporting this: https://i.imgur.com/TwiYPiC.png\r\ntb1q0yempvk7fwqz2k9j6utkkkuyt7fqznqjwplkhu -> tb1q0yempvk7fwqz2k9j6utkkkuyt7fqznqjwplkhu\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\nMake an internal transaction and put the txid into this:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/Nex4rius/47f4c2959d1d29cf51bac6bd4054d323\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nBitcoin Core Version v0.19.0.1 (64-Bit)\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\nWindow 10\r\n\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue? What is your operating system and its version? If Linux, what is your desktop environment and graphical shell? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
