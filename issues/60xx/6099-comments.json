I wanted to submit this first to get initial feedback before spending more time, though.  But yes, I realise that it is probably a matter of taste.\r\n\r\nNote that at least some of the added lines of code are probably due to more prevalent line breaks in my coding style than in some of the replaced code.  Also more savings will come when removing some `setup_network` functions becomes possible.",

Currently we specify the exact arguments that are fed into bitcoind in every test. This would bury it in more Python syntactic sugar.\r\n",
