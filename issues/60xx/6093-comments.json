On POSIX systems, messed up environment settings can cause a failure ([Python test](https://gist.github.com/dexX7/ab3f7411a9040e96d55c)).\r\n2. During the deinitialization, an internal facet pointer of `boost::path` is deleted, and if `boost::path` was not initialized by the main thread, it causes failures such as #3136 (and related).\r\n\r\nThe current situation:\r\n\r\n1. As default, the \"C\" locale is used.\r\n2. On POSIX systems, the environment locale is used (via `std::locale(\"\")`).\r\n3. On POSIX systems, to detect bad environment settings, an exception thrown by `std::locale(\"\")` is caught.\r\n4. On POSIX systems, and if there are bad environment settings, the \"C\" locale is used as fallback.\r\n5. As workaround, to explicitly force the initialization of the internal facet pointer by the main thread, `boost::filesystem::path::imbue()` is called.\r\n6. Bad initialization of `boost::filesystem::boost::path` can result in exceptions, which are currently not caught.\r\n7. On Windows systems, the \"C\" locale appearingly does not cover the whole character set, which can result in (6), as shown by #6078.\r\n\r\nIn practise, the current 0.10.1 can result in a failure on Russian (and other) Windows, and earlier versions are affected by the deinitialization issue, resulting in faulty Boost test executions, as well as other failures during the shutdown, such as the crash reported in the context of rebuilding the block database.",

Otherwise, you could just replace the first call with std::locale().\r\n\r\nThe below is greatly simplified and I think it does what we want. Note that std::locale::global(\"\") does not work as intended on windows, presumably because we're statically linking libstdc++. The basic C setlocale() does though.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid SetupEnvironment()\r\n{\r\n    if (!setlocale(LC_ALL, \"\"))\r\n    {\r\n        setenv(\"LC_ALL\", \"C\", 1);\r\n        setlocale(LC_ALL, \"C\");\r\n    }\r\n    boost::filesystem::path::imbue(std::locale());\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAll we're really trying to accomplish here is to teach boost how to handle locale-specific char conversions for paths, right? Afaik we don't mess with c++ locales elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe above accomplishes that, won't throw exceptions, and I believe it's portable. Tested and verified with a Chinese profile/username/locale on win7, and on Linux with a busted locale via ```LC_LANG=bad ./bitcoind```",

Looks like that's what influences the default locale at runtime rather than the system locale.\r\n\r\nSome testing using ```printf(\"locale %s:\"setlocale(LC_ALL,NULL))```:\r\nWith a Chinese format selected:```locale: Chinese (Simplified)_People's Republic of China.936```\r\nWith English selected: ```English_United States.1252```\r\n\r\nSo.. makes sense.

In your simpler solution I can trigger a runtime error, if I use the path `\"E:\\LocaleTests\\ÃÂÃÂ·ÃÂ·ÃÂ°\"` (which is a legit path) on a German localized Windows, while 0.9.3 and my patch results in `\"Error: Specified data directory \"E:\\LocaleTests\\????\" does not exist.\"`.

It looks like it took me a little while to figure out exactly what you already had, I just had to work through it myself for it to make sense. Nice detective work!\r\n\r\n@laanwj Agreed on making it windows only for 0.10, and on adding comments.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we're depending on internal boost workings here that may change in the future, I wonder if it'd be worthwhile to add a quick test to use './bitcoind.exe -datadir=c:\\something\\non-latin'. Sadly, I don't think we could trust wine to faithfully reproduce the issue, but at least we'd have a set of tests that could be run manually.\r\n\r\nIf that's possible, we'd probably want to bake it into the test_bitcoin.exe binary to rule out python/shell middle-man issues.\r\n\r\nEdit: thinking on it a little more, using -datadir for a test is overkill. We could just add a quick unit-test to add a subdir inside the current profile and touch a file in there.",

      "body" : "> @laanwj: Question: at least for the 0.10 branch, can you code this so that it doesn't affect behavior on non-Windows? \r\n\r\nIs this the case? [Travis is happy](https://travis-ci.org/dexX7/bitcoin/builds/60885645) with the change applied on top of 0.10.1, and the bad-environment test passes as well. It does not bring back #3136, and at least to my understanding, it should restore the behavior of pre-0.10, but without the multithreading-deinitialization issue. *But please don't give my understanding much weight here.* \r\n\r\nAll this is based on the assumption that [path::codecvt()](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/blob/boost-1.55.0/src/path.cpp#L884-L914) is called via `boost::filesystem::path` at some point, which then undergoes a [similar path](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/blob/boost-1.55.0/src/path.cpp#L792-L873) as `path::imbue()` does, to return the original locale.\r\n\r\n> @theuni: Thanks for sticking with this and explaining the issue well.\r\n\r\nIt's the least I can do, given that my fix for #3136 (deinitialization issue), and the follow up #5950 (bad environment handling), ultimately led in this situation.\r\n\r\n> We could just add a quick unit-test to add a subdir inside the current profile and touch a file in there.\r\n\r\nHaving more tests for this would be incredibly useful.\r\n\r\nThere might be a twist though: the unit tests (via [TestingSetup](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.10/src/test/test_bitcoin.cpp#L41-L43)) appear to use `pathTemp = GetTempPath() / ...` for the temporary test datadir, and this probably throws, even before any tests are executed, if `path` can't handle paths inside the current profile, because `GetTempPath()` returns `\\Users\\{username}\\AppData\\Local\\Temp` as per default on Windows Vista+.\r\n\r\nJust brainstorming on this: what I [tested manually](https://gist.github.com/dexX7/7394a947b29c7d84c710#file-results_bitcoind-log) might be wrapped into a Python test, which starts and stops nodes, using a bunch of datadirs with \"exotic\" characters. Unfortunally I'm not sure, which test data could be used for it, given that, appearingly, the system's localization plays a significant role here (e.g. `ÃÂÃ¢ÂÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¬ÃÂ®` passes on my system, while `ÃÂÃÂ·ÃÂ·ÃÂ°`, which seems to work fine for the original poster of #6078, doesn't).\r\n\r\nTackling this from another perspective: ideally there would also be some form of mitigation in the context of `GetDataDir()` ([create datadir] and related), to a) catch potential exceptions, and b) provide some form of guidance for the user, or more telling messages, if it actually happens.\r\n\r\nEdit: where I'm getting: there are probably other related issues in the context of the filesystem, which are not related to localization. For example, using a datadir without permission, results in a segfault.",
