In phase one request the block hashes with `getblockhash`. Then in phase two request the block data. An example can be found in linearize.py (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/contrib/linearize).\r\n\r\nAlso: mind that, in contrast to block hashes, block heights are not stable identifiers for a block.
