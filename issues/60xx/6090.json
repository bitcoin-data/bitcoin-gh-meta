   "body" : "I can see different value of my last transaction in the wallet Bitcoin Core 0.10.1 and in the Blockchain.\nLook at the screenshot from the wallet (the attachment) and compare it to:\nhttps://blockchain.info/tx/923edf4f1e0a5da5e0995f0dcca04152c06af094e67d5d49571ba7984bbe0e15\n\nThe difference is strange and I can't understand why (over 1.5 year in Bitcoin network and I can see first time something similar). I didn't ask yet our technicians, firstly I would like to have your opinion about it. I turned off the wallet immediately (after first confirmation) when i saw that in Blockchain.org the value is completely different. I'm more a Bitcoin investor than a Bitcoin programmer, but I take care seriously about security on my computers.  \n\nDoes have anyone an idea what is it (an error in Blockchain or a theft) and what to do with it? \n![transaction-on-the-wallet-clear](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10259280/7425228/4602cdf2-efad-11e4-81fb-d88a14eb9b21.png)\n",
