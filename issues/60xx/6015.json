On the other hand, if that problem is solved, it would allow testnet to behave _exactly_ like main net (it would be possible to remove the weird \"if no block has been mined for 20 minutes, accept blocks at diff 1\").\n\nThat would make seeding peers impossible unless you specify them, but it would make testing so much easier in a lot of cases.\n",
