The function no longer crashes my laptop. In my impression, it would indeed make sense only to run `walletnotify` on the newly added address when rescanning. Indeed, I do not think that anybody expects `walletnotify` to notify transactions totally unrelated to the address being imported by the `importaddress` function. ",
