And if want to use your own string type, at the very least you'd need to implement a custom text field to make use of it. There's no saying what QLineEdit, or at a lower level, X/Win32/OSX, does internally. It may scatter buffers with (part of) the passphrase everywhere in the heap.\n\nA possible suggestion (I think by @gmaxwell) was for a \"secure entry\" sandbox, e.g. launching a new process that runs fully memory-locked that captures the passphrase and does the private key handling and signing so that nothing sensitive has to leave the process. This would also allow utilizing special OS support for process isolation.\n",
