   "body" : "I've brought this previous pull request up to date and defined a new use case for it https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4687 .\n\n```\nThis option is useful for mining pools that want faster block propagation.\nOutbound connections will statistically have better overall network connectivity\nthan incoming connections. This is due to most nodes that accept these\noutbound connections supporting a maximum of 125 connections.\nInbound connections are often NAT restricted and will then only support 8\nconnections. These NAT restricted connections are less desirable for pools.\nThis can be demonstrated using the following example of a pool with 125 connections.\nThis example makes the assumption that inbound connections are NAT restricted and \nlimited to 8 connections while outbound connections connect to nodes with the\ndefault connection limit of 125.\nConnection capacity within one hop of pool with default settings:\n(8 outbound connections * 125 connections per node) +\n(117 incoming connections * 8 connections per node) =\n1936 Connections within one hop of the pool server\n(125 outbound connections * 125 connections per node) =\n15625 Connections within one hop of the pool server\nBased off of these calculations a pool server can have about 8 times the\noverall network connections within one hop while establishing\nthe same amount of connections itself. In reality it will likely be even more\ndue to the bitcoin network having far more available connections slots on nodes\nthan there are nodes trying to connect to those slots.\nThis setting should only be used by pool operators.\n```\n",
