      "body" : "The disk space required for Bitcoin Core (about 48 GB) costs about $2 today, and the initial download only needs to be done once. If the node sync makes your computer unusable, this is a problem with your operating system managing resources poorly - you may wish to try upgrading it.\r\n\r\nIt is not our problem if you don't want to use Bitcoin: other \"clients\" are *not* Bitcoin; they only remotely access Bitcoin Core nodes, and compromise your security and privacy to varying degrees by trusting those other nodes.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the huge conceptual to-do list does include at least making the wallet work as a remote/trusting node while it does the sync in the background - but it isn't a high priority item for anyone AFAIK. If that is important to you, you may wish to create a bounty to fund its development.",

One of\nthem is running a full node, like Bitcoin Core implements. This gives you\nthe highest level of protection and security against fraudulent\ntransactions. In addition, it helps other clients get their data. The\ndownside is that this requires verifying and storing all transactions\n(though a reduced mode where they are still downloaded and verified, but\nnot stored forever, is in the works).\n\nAs said, if you're trade in some security for convenience, other software\nis likely a better choice for you. See the bitcoin.org website.\n",
