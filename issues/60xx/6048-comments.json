And if the includes in #5696 (not so many now that the policy stuff is left out) trigger a rebase (like they have done many times before), this could still not need rebase and have an older commit ID the replacement of https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/691161d419fe3d82d7a49b511ef80e2b24332aac.\r\nI also wanted to show additional motivation for  #5975 (or maybe merge both together, it's not that big of a change), for example, to support the argument for merging #5975 before #6055.\r\n\r\nAbout the building error, I don't know why forgetting .h files in the makefile doesn't fail in my computer, but fixed.\r\n\r\nAnyway, even if it's independent from #5696, merging one would trigger a trivial rebase on the other, so closing until #5696 and #5975.",
