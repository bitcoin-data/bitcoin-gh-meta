   "body" : "This is a suggestion(s) for improvement.\n\nIt would be nice to be able to have a single blockchain collector daemon (bitcoind) running on an always-on server, and to be able to connect to it with various clients (bitcoin-qt, bitcoin-cli, new clients yet to be developed) on various machines on my home network. Then I can have the advantages of the GUI, without having to worry about running it all the time, just to catch up with the blockchain.\n\nOn Windows, you could still have the unified Bitcoin Core installer, but you'd be able to point it to a remote instance of the daemon. Ideally, you'd be able to run the daemon as a service on Windows, or headless on Linux. (I think the latter is already happening with bitcoind, but IDK which clients can connect to it.)\n\nSorry I'm not totally clear yet on which aspects of this are already implemented, but it isn't all yet.\n",
