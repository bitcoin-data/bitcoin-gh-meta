Heck the code's a lot cleaner than what's currently inside bitcoin itself.\n\nFurthermore a _good_ reference implementation would IMO contain only the bare essentials to illustrate the algorithm, and those expressed as simply as possible. Which would be something like a Python script containing only the \"getwork\" call to get work, a loop over all nonces to search for the correct one, followed by a \"getwork\" call when the target's matched.\n\nSuch an implementation however, would perform so poorly that no one would use it, and as a result it wouldn't be tested, making it likely to have bugs. Which is roughly the same for the builtin miner; i.e. only people who don't know or care what they're doing still use it.\n",
