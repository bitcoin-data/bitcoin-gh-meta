The io_service object manages these actions, waits for any of them to complete then dispatches the appropriate event handler.\n\nAll of that happens _only_ within the threads from which you call io_service.run(), io_service.run_one(), io_service.poll() or io_service.poll_one(). As a result this allows future expansion into multiple threads by simple invoking io_service.run() in a new thread, but _doesn't_ inherently add more threads (just allows for it).\n",

I however have a day job which doesn't leave me much time during the week to reply _immediately_. So being patient enough to wait till the next weekend following your comment might be nice.\n\nThen as for the actual content of your comment:\n\n> Your last commit is likely to break sth\n\nPlease elaborate, because I've carefully checked _how_ my change would affect existing code. As far as I could see there should be no difference except the _location_ from where the shutdown thread gets started.\n\n> or at least change the current behaviour once more\n\nAs explained above: shutdown behaviour should not be changed for existing/untouched code. It should only affect the termination of the RPC handling's shutdown sequence.\n\nI.e. the RPC code _needs_ to be interrupted by a signal in order to terminate it. Setting a variable that can be polled (fShutdown) isn't enough because we're blocking until some kind of event (network I/O or internal operation on io_service or one of the sockets) occurs.\n",
