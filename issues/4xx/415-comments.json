Its a cool feature for those who wish to make their bitcoin usage anonymous, but by itself it does not even get close to providing anonymity.  It also pushes the wrong message about bitcoin: it was designed to be, and is anonymous; and that it is great for use in illegal activity.  That message should be highly avoided as it is highly detrimental to the adoption of bitcoin.  This as a separate branch is cool, but it should not be in the mainline IMO.  Additionally, does this work as expected if you are using a OP_EVAL address or a compressed pubkey address?\n",

My idea is that the UI bits (dialogs, widgets, screens) are independent of a specific bitcoin implementation. The UI bits communicate with the models through method calls and Qt signals. The models communicate with the core in whatever way they need to; that includes changing globals if you really need to, though I'd personally prefer it as parameter to minimize the factor of surprise.\n\nThanks\n",

Every other pull request (including ones which many would argue are much more important than this one) is subject to the same requirements.

AFAIK no one has even tested this with either, so it should wait.  That isn't bikesheding, thats just wait until it is known to work.\nAlso, the +1s are completely worthless, if this pull request is well-tested and known to work, I would think no one would have objections to it being merged, so +1s arent worth anything.\n",

In the coin control tab I'm seeing all the new addresses separated from each other and the change by blank lines, suggesting there's no way of tying the together, but they're all outputs of the same transaction.  Is that a bug?  I would expect all the new outputs as well as the change to be lumped in with the big group that the input was part of before this transaction.\n",

Now it takes about half a second on my wallet instead of 7 seconds and makes the code simpler to read too.  It's odd - after changing the return type of ExpandGroupings to be void, the time it took dropped from 72 to 2.5 seconds, but then the next day it went back up to 7 seconds.  I made a few new big transactions, but I was surprised it added such a delay.\n\nI committed my change here:\n\nhttps://github.com/dooglus/bitcoin/commit/87168d9a8ecd270306f7d1deb7a14f2d773d2fec\n\nI'm not sure what to do with the IsDisjoint() function - it's only used in wallet.cpp, and isn't really anything to do with wallets, so I made it a file local (static) function, then didn't need to declare it in the header.\n",

True if the two input sets are disjoint (have no members in common).\nSets are sorted, so you can iterate through them in order rather than having to compare every member of the first with every member of the second.\n\nBut first give me a chance to rewrite the GetAddressGroupings function to no longer need IsDisjoint().\n",
