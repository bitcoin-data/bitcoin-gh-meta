      "body" : "I have some suggestions to this pull request:\n- Do not allow to erase confirmed transactions:\n  They would be recovered through rescan, so why delete them?\n  (Some wallet pruning funtionality, to clean up large wallets,\n  and erase old spent transactions could make sense, but thats a different story.)\n- Forget about the rescan:\n  If we dont allow erasing confirmed transaction there is no reason to do a rescan as\n  the wallet vfSpent flags have been removed.\n- Rename \"zapwallettx\" to \"erasewallettx\":\n  I think the term \"erase\" is preferred to be used in software over \"zap\" for deleting something permanently.\n- Do not make any changes in walletdb.cpp at all:\n  Currently we pass a wallet pointer to walletdb.cpp and then loop mapWallet there.\n  Instead simply loop mapWallet in wallet.cpp and fill vErasedTxes. Then loop\n  vErasedTxes and call CWallet::EraseFromWallet for every tx to erase. This function deletes both, database and mapWallet. No code additions to walletdb.cpp needed.\n- Add special case parameter \"all\":\n  If the passed txid is \"all\" => erase all unconfirmed transactions.\n  The loop could be done in the rpc method and fill the queue with all unconfirmed transactions already.\n  Then simply pass the queue directly to CWallet::EraseWalletTxes.\n  So EraseWalletTxes takes a queue as parameter, which is either all or only 1 unconformed tx.\n- Remove zapwallettxes completely:\n  The reason for zapwallettxes to run on startup and do a rescan was to avoid messing up the wallet\n  vfSpent flags. Now that they are gone and if we had a \"erasewallettx all/txid\", I vote for removing\n  zapwallettxes completely. Zapwallettxes doesnt really solve anything other than removing unconfirmed transactions.\n  If your wallet is that corrupt then you are better off using either berkeley db repair tools or start a new clean wallet by using salvagewallet/pywallet/importwallet.\n- Remove from mapTxSpends:\n  Every erased transaction needs to be removed from CWallet::mapTxSpends.\n  The code could be added to CWallet::EraseFromWallet.\n- Remove from setLockedCoins:\n  To have a clean state of CWallet::setLockedCoins the transaction should be removed there (if its in there).\n  The code could be added to CWallet::EraseFromWallet.\n- (Remove from coin control selection):\n  You could trigger a temporary minor bug, if you select a transaction in coin control and then erase it.\n  But this would require to pass a signal to walletmodel. Its no critical bug, even if it happens, and very unlikely scenario, so I would be fine just forgetting about this.\n- Mention metadata in rpc help text:\n  Transaction metadata like strFromAccount gets lost, if someone erases an unconfirmed transaction, which then gets confirmed because it had already been broadcasted.\n  I think we shouldnt bother much, but at least mention this in the rpc help text:\n  \"Notice: An erased transaction which still gets confirmed by miners, will be readded to the wallet without transaction meta data e.g. account owner and payment request information.\"\n- About the workqueue: \n  - This loop can be removed: for (unsigned int nVoutIndex = 0; nVoutIndex &lt; wtx.vout.size(); nVoutIndex++).\n    It is enough to check the hash only.\n    if (txin.prevout.hash == wtx.GetHash()) => Found child\n  - it is possible transactions get added multiple times to the queue, so to have a clean algorithm, I suggest adding txs into a set&lt;uint256&gt;\n    to ensure every transaction only gets processed once. If a transaction is already in the set, skip it, because\n    it is or was already in the queue.\n  - nit: use vector instead of &lt;queue&gt;, just because we dont use queue anywhere else. (not important)\n- Return bool instead of DBErrors:\n  DBErrors is for when loading the wallet.\n- Remove DB_NEED_REWRITE and cr+:\n  Those 2 dont make sense either. The \"c\" is for DB_CREATE if the wallet file does not exist\n  and rewrite gets checked on wallet load. But they should remove anyway if we refactor\n  the code from walletdb.cpp to wallet.cpp as I suggested above.\n- Notify GUI: \n  For every erased transaction we need to update the GUI. This can be done when looping vErasedTxes.\n  NotifyTransactionChanged(this, hash, CT_DELETED);\n",
