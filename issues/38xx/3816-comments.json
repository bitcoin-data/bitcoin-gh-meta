Most of the guys that are doing any of this stuff commercially SHOULD be building out their own transaction \"management\" mechanisms since its their money and they should have appropriate architecture, code and processes in place to mitigate losses for themselves and their customers. IF they don't have the skills to do it .. too bad, no money for Timmy. \n\nFundamentally: The bullshit we saw recently with our dear friend mark can not be repeated again - giving \"people\" all the OPEN code, the fruit of YOUR loins, so they can take it out there and make Bitcoin look bad is really not cool.

Some of the biggest sites - coinbase and mtgox - have both tried the best to re-implement transactions and network behavior, but both seem to have had extraordinary trouble managing to keep up with smaller nuances. Coinbase seems to have some strange issues with their software keeping up with the blockchain and sending proper transactions, mtgox has had issues sending transactions (invalid DER encoding) and managing to automatically resend unconfirmed transactions without double spending the inputs. \n\nIf some incredibly well funded ventures have trouble scaling bitcoin transactions, what chance does the self-funded startup or small company have? `bitcoind` is inadequate for almost any situation larger than a couple of issues, which leaves users reaching for blockchain.info, who have been dispensing completely incorrect (missing transactions, bad spent/unspent information, invalid balancea)  information for at least a week now. \n\nIf we want to avoid centralization the available solutions need to be improved, removing the awful `accounts` feature is hopefully a catalyst. \n",

Open source doesn't work by \"this should exist\" but by \"scratch your own itch\". The open source community is not a free resource to fix your company's issues.\n\nThe reality is that the few developers of Bitcoin Core are struggling to maintain what exists now. This means that the scope needs to be narrowed, not widened.\n\nIf the current broken solution is dropped from bitcoind that leaves the way open for independent, new systems that can be built _on top_ of bitcoind. No need to implement transaction handling yourself, you can still use bitcoind for that.\n",

The open source community is not a free resource to fix your company's issues.\n\nAgain, I agree. It's unfortunately something that not a lot of people want to get involved with. To contribute such a codebase anonymously would insight trust issues, to do it with a real name would make the person a target should a programming mistake result in the loss of Bitcoin for a third party. I don't think it's a risk anybody reasonably wants to put themselves at risk of, given how the community has treated actors like this in the past and today.\n",

It would be good if the accounts feature would be indeed flagged as deprecated (see laanjw's proposal to change to labels [1]). I know of plenty merchants, exchanges, etc. who (mis-) use the account system. It will be very helpful to have a much better documented RPC, so that people who implement account features can build together in the open, instead of closed source. Quite a few people use bitcoind only through the RPC without knowing internals. I'm implementing an account system which is layered over bitcoind, not using the internal account system. As I understand that's what most larger operations do.\n\n[1] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3664#issuecomment-35386000\n",

I believe the scope of bitcoind should be stated in the readme and docs, and the API and docs improved. What would be the best way to build say a merchant/exchange/etc. solution in an opensource way? I think this matter is very important and does not get enough attention. I don't have the resources or knowledge to re-write bitcoin from scratch, and it's not a reasonable expectation.

Making it a fork of bitcoind will just make it harder to maintain over time.\n\nThe scope of Bitcoin Core is narrowing toward maintenance of the node infrastructure and consensus. Wallet innovations happen somewhere else, and so should accounting, as well as smart integration of deterministic key generation and such. See for example https://github.com/ciphrex/CoinVault that @CodeShark has been working on.\n\nI'm all for flagging the account system as deprecated, by the way. This could be added to the RPC help.

Bitcoin core plays the opensource card when it suits them, and the scam accusation is getting more and more out of date as time goes on.

Unfortunately what \"bitcoin wizards\" chose instead to do is invent something called side-chains, and start a for-profit enterprise around it.

I heard some people are going to work on a new wallet on a separate branch, so if the design is done right this time, it will include the appropriate hooks for building an account system on top.\n\nLots of aspects are confused in one project right now, this should unravel or it is going to cause problems for certain. You cannot have a few overworked devs maintain the entire ecosystem. It is important for us to be able to focus on the core infrastructure as there are many challenges ahead there. First and foremost the network should keep running and scaling.\n\nPeople _should_ be able to say, fork the wallet code and account code without forking the consensus code as well. Right now that is kind of unwieldy with everything in one project. For the steps toward splitting things up, some migration is going to be necessary, and sometimes that's going to come with the pain of APIs being deprecated.\n\nThat said, yes the deprecation needs to be better documented.

      "body" : "<question/diatribe directed to @jgarzikf> \n\nJeff, with all due respect, this is/has been the position that has been held for as long as I have been involved, which by now, is not an insubstantial amount of time. ( thanks mainly to our friends at BFL ;) ) \n\nHow can this be a brainstorming session if everyone that matters (the devs) are defending the status quo? and frankly, in my opinion directly attacking any position that attempts to move it in any meaningful direction. Despite the length and time I took to write this, this thread is not my whole being, but it does represent something I dearly love and care about, perhaps too much. I am sincerely extremely saddened by the ABSOLUTE immovability of this general situation. (The wallet falls into the same category). This brainstorming session just sounds like an extremely small loud echo chamber to me. i.e.. the seats are reserved, doors locked and guarded and the invitations into the discussion are actively censored and filtered,or simply dismissed by discrediting the voices of descent. Reminds me of the Free Masons. Lol. \n</question/diatribe directed to @jgarzikf> \n\n<my bitcoin philosophy>\nA project that at one point had well over USD 1 Billion  invested. I know it had moments of far greater  glory, but lets stick to a reasonably conservative number for shits and giggle - what the REAL value is, can be left for another debate, but the bottomline: it can not continue to be run like this considering the amount of loot involved. \n\nIf Satoshi was still around, he could fill the vacuum of \"the voice of reason\" .. very much like what Linus does. We do not have this luxury, unfortunately. The keys to the kingdom, and ultimately the responsibility for that ~$1B were handed over to \"you guys\" .. the devs... the guys that allow or do not allow the consensus to be accepted and rolled into the cake, using what seems to be with a very simple and open ticket/merge process. \n\nRegardless of who is writing what, the perception from at least my point of view, is that this project is being stifled by the this confusion and most importantly: makes the people that have their $1B (whatever) invested very vulnerable to any deliberate/unintentional manipulation of the project. Notice I said perception, i.e. this is not an accusation .. it is simply my opinion on what I see as the result of all the decisions being made, which come out as the binary that is Bitcoin. The changelog is testament to your hard work, in all it's awesomeness. (with a few warts here and there) ;) \n\nHowever the status quo just can not continue. The accounting system is one example of the fragmentation of what SHOULD and WAS INTENDED to be a project for the people by the people, IF I understand Satoshi's philosophy correctly. \n\nWe get fucked over everyday by things we can not control. The banks, the government, your boss, your wife, your parents, the weather, viruses, bears, lions, hyenas etc etc etc ..  Why should we allow the one thing we DO have the control over to be, frankly, this, screwed up? Seriously guys ... please, for the love of god .. understand, this is NOT a community project, it is not a hobby, it is not behaving like an open source consensus driven entity, and most certainly should not be allowed to be a ego/self interest based entity(as noted by some above). If you want to get all crystal ballish - it CAN and SHOULD  be the future of all mankind, if taken to the the ultimate iteration of being the thing that controls all things. SkyNet is alive ... initiate T1000 lock on Satoshi .... scene opens with with Arnie naked in parking lot ;) \n\nUntil we can agree on these fundamental principles, this discussion (and ultimately the entire project )  will continue to be a mobius strrip.\n\nThe perception is that I am a troll that contributes nothing to Bitcoin. That may/or may not be true. I accept both positions. Like me or hate me, I don't think I am wrong. I feel that I have done more than my fair share for this project.. some of it you will never know about. Some of it may be viewed as counter productive,  I don't agree and frankly don't give 2 shits of what anyone thinks about me. Whatever.. Who I am and what I do is not really the point here. Play the ball and not the player. I only say this, because people have the tendency to discredit other peoples opinions based on, as someone above put it, their \"merit\" or their \"expectations\" or \"identifying obligations\" or \"being a troll\" or \"not understanding the OP's question \" or \"understanding the implications to other parties\" or any number of excuses for not doing what NEEDS to be done. As I pointed out, this is not and should not be a merit based project. Consensus can not be merit based. See feudalism, slavery, right to vote, etc etc etc.. as examples of this behaviour. Merit does not automatically mean liberty/freedom/democracy/altruism therefore it can not be the yardstick by which things are measured. \n\nSimply :\nI do not see any mechanism for consensus, and in fact I see the complete opposite. The code that is released is the \"baby\" that is the product of a very small elite groups decisions. Merging or not merging code is the way that this control is accomplished, and that is the reason for this unbelievably long comment. ( Holy shit I can talk a lot of shit sometimes when I am worked up - take solace in the fact that my wife and child have to deal with me everyday - pity them! ) ;) \n\nThe simple fact is that people do not understand the nuance of the code involved and thus have little capacity to overcome the MASSIVE learning curve required to participate/contribute in any meaningful way,I tried, I failed, I am to old for this, if I was 20 I would rewrite all of this in ASM. I have learnt and forgotten enough programming languages to fill a small dump truck, I have no interest in learning another, especially if it is only for one, very complex project, regardless of my passion for it. My job is in enterprise architecture.. something I have done plenty of at all different levels, so I speak from a perspective that comprehends this all at a view that is above the nitty gritty of the individual code merges, although I do watch all of them with great interest. Kano and Lukes little war is another that amused me endlessly, less so now that I can't afford to spend 50K on any kind of meaningful gear to mine on especially with the price being/doing what it is. \n\nAnway .. the lack of participation should not be used as an excuse for what is being allowed to perpetuate. i.e. All attempts/opportunities for simplification, THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE NEW BLOOD TO JOIN, seem to be blocked automatically and then defended vehemently, when someone asks: WTF?! Why can't we just make it easier for people to implement/develop/contribute to the code? Why can't there  \"just\" be an API or exposed RPC?etc etc the kinds of questions get torpedoed so fast they must be based on some auto-reply non-heuristic email rules. \n\nFinally,my dear friends, this is intended as a plea not a admonishment. Can we please, please, please stop playing politics and take ownership of what this project ultimately means for the future, regardless of the influence of what the fiscal positions that people hold or their reliance on obsolete code which should be obliterated not perpetuated ad-infinitum (or so it seems to me). These positions are very obviously skewing the most important strategic decisions (or more often than not the lack of) from being made. Please, take a step back, and do what's right for the project, not what is right from your own personal financial perspective. The major stakeholders with tons of cash invested, can afford more programmers in Bangalor. Don't worry about them. They will be fine. Worry about us. The ones that use it. The ones that vote with their Satoshi's every time a block is generated. Worry about the ones that don't and more importantly WON'T anymore because of some (more than one) very unpleasant events in the past, and I am not talking about SR or BMR  \n </my bitcoin philosophy>\n\nI promise I will no longer pollute this thread with my thoughts. I think I have said it all.. Dunno .. we will see. Depends on who is going to give me a cookie. \n\nThank you for all your efforts everyone.

      "body" : "Although I agree that a new rpc interface for a separated wallet is the way to go long term, I'm not convinced that a smaller redesign (maybe just moving to int satoshis and getting rid of accounts) it's a waste of time.\nThere's at least 3 things that will require significant refactoring work that I believe go before separating the wallet: moving transaction consensus validation (to be used by libconsensus), moving the p2p protocol messages and as much policy-related code as possible out of main.\nFrom those 3 things, it seems to me that something like #4646 (moving p2p messages out of main) is specially important for separating the wallet.\nMaybe the first step is separating it in different binaries.\nSay, instead of having --disable-wallet, that could be the default for bitcoind, and then have a bitcoind-wallet and bitcoin-client-wallet. Maybe always build bitcoin-qt with wallet.\nThen at some point separate the repos (maybe bitcoin core becomes a subrepository of bitcoin-wallet ?). I don't know, maybe this belongs to another issue...\nMy point is, without having a roadmap for the wallet separation, postponing any changes to the rpc interface seems like an unnecessary burden. Simplifying or deleting some rpc calls can actually be good for the separation even if bigger changes are going to happen after the separation.\n\nI would be in favor of declaring accounts deprecated for 0.10 and removing them for 0.11, for example, even if the wallet only gets fully separated by 0.12 or 0.13. \n",

Usually that involves some trust or custodian relationship, between account holder and custodian. The custodian holds money for the account holder. In Bitcoin usually there is no such relationship. Trusted third parties are avoided altogether. The account system as it existed is merely a labelling system. Just attaching some string to a key is trivial - that's not the problem of accounting. So what used to be \"accounts\" has nothing to do with accounts in the sense of somebody holding money for another person. That's what a bank account is, and one can debate whether Bitcoin web-wallets are like banks or not.\n\nBitcoin has some very limited facilities to manage trust - a combination of multi-sig and escrow e.g. But for many applications it is very complicated, so that in the last 3 years almost no progress has been made for advanced applications. It is related to the underlying economic model. \n\nThere is a deeper reason nobody has implemented a proper layer to do accounting on top of Bitcoin - nobody in the Bitcoin (-core) project believes its necessary or interesting. I'd expect this to be the case in the future. \n",

      "body" : "@benjyz Thanks for your reply.\n\nYou're absolutely right. Bitcoin Core's wallet isn't a good accounting system, nor should it attempt to be one. I fully agree. Anyone who needs a good accounting system as you describe _must_ implement their own solution. There's no sense in thinking Core's developers should develop an interest in formal accounting :)\n\nHowever, the functionality provided by accounts today, while broken from a perspective of \"is it a good accounting system or not\", has been in Core for a very long time. I've depended on it since 2011, when it was still labels instead of accounts, and, the way I'm using it, it's never let me down.\n\nCheck this out:\n\n```\n$ ls -l cron.php\n-rw-r--r-- 1 mike mike 2154 Aug  5  2013 cron.php\n$ grep 'c->' cron.php\n    $arr = $c->listreceivedbyaddress(10, false);\n      $c->sendtoaddress($destaddr, $residue);\n      $c->setaccount($rcvd[\"address\"], \"\");\n      //$c->setlabel($rcvd[\"address\"], \"\");\n```\n\nThat's code from a service I've been running for five years, and that I haven't had to change in the past 2.5 years. And as you can see, it originally used labels, until they were replaced by \"accounts\".\n\nThe specific methods I need are:\n- getnewaddress(label)\n- setlabel(address)\n- listreceivedbyaddress, with label information\n- listlabels\n- move(...)\n\nIf I can't have those, my I'll be forced into either staying with an old version of Core (never good, because CVEs) or expending a lot of effort implementing a database application that talks to the wallet in order to retain the functionality I've gotten from Core since time immemorial (ok, not that long, but still! :) ).\n\nIs it too much to ask to retain remove these (renamed) wallet methods?\n",

      "body" : "@mikegogulski if C is holding money for A, say 42 BTC, in terms of Bitcoin, that is equivalent with C owning 42 BTC. The fact that C labels an address \"I hold BTC for A\" doesn't change this fact. Accounts was introduced after the 2009 release and was a mere afterthought to Bitcoin's operation. The word accounts and accounting is completely misleading. Accounts is a concept that comes from banking, and Bitcoin doesn't allow for banking. Bitcoin removed all trust entirely, and its very hard or impossible to build trust-relationships on top. If you hold money for others, in terms of Bitcoin's model you're doing it wrong. In particular matching human ID to money has another problem - traditional law and nation states see themselves as the watchdog of financial transactions. In terms of traditional law its not even clear that holding Bitcoin as money is \"legal\". Because if it were legal the question is why I can't pay my taxes in Bitcoin or send it to a bank.\n\nThere are better ways to do this with multi-sig, escrow, HD wallets, green-addresses, time-lock contracts, ColoredCoins, etc. I've been working on related problems for years, but I don't expect \"core\" cater to users. I guess everyone can choose whether they want to work on, such as Zero-knowledge-Sidechain magic or whatever the case may be. It is noteworthy that millions of people are using Bitcoin in the \"wrong\" way via web-wallets and exchanges (which have to implement AML/KYC). I doubt that \"accounting\" as an API is a fruitful approach. It would be better to expose multi-sig and escrow in some way that makes custodian relationships safer. If you really need these kinds of features, you're more likely better off with an alternative which aims to implement them.\n\nFurther info:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting\n",

I rely on:\n- `getaddressesbyaccount` and `getaccountaddress` to provide deposit addresses for users\n- `listaccounts` and `move` to detect new deposits (using `move` to move processed deposits to a non-user account, so they don't show up again next time I run `listaccounts`)\n- `getbalance` to check whether the user has any deposits with less than 6 confirmations\n\nThese methods appear to work very well for me. I'm aware that the accounting system is confusing and badly named, but it provides functionality which is hard to find elsewhere.\n\nI wouldn't care if the word 'account' was replaced by 'label' in all the RPC calls. I would mind if the RPC calls were removed.\n",

I don't want to know about a deposit at all until it has 6 confirmations. Until then it's possible for the number of confirmations to go up and down as reorgs happen. I like how I don't have to care about that if I use `listaccounts` - it hides all that complexity from me. I thought it handled maleability too, but @jgarzik's cryptic comment in the [OP of this thread](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3816#issue-28982757) suggests it might not. I [asked for further details](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3816#issuecomment-167766437) but got no response so I'm not sure if there's really an outstanding issue or not.\n",

I've noticed that all of the accounting features have been marked as deprecated and marked for removal; Personally I'm fine with many of them disappearing such as SendFrom, GetBalance etc as I can implement these myself when they're eventually removed.\r\n\r\nThe thing which concerns me is that, short of storing _every single generated address_ in my own database and mapping it against an account ID, I won't be able to determine when a payment has been sent to one of the generated addresses. I've read that the label feature (I assume the same one that's present in the Receive tab of BitcoinQt) could be the replacement; is there any update on this?
