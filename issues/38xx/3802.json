   "body" : "I have seen in lots of guys on forums needing a second node at home and complaining about the massive download time it will take to add that node.  Now, if they thought that far, most of them could manually add an existing LAN node to their conf, but the truth is not many people dig under the hood enough.  Plus the ip changes etc etc.\n\nI'm not sure what the security implications would be of a node broadcasting it's availability on the LAN and hooking up with other nodes automatically.  I'd be happy as long as the node also has a connection with other nodes on the greater internet to make sure it's not being sent a bunch of lies locally.  \n\nSurely this will have savings for the network in general as some of the bandwidth usage gets moved to the LAN rather than the greater internet.  This should also save individual users' bandwidth.\n\nPerhaps using something like Simple Service Discovery Protocol.  \n\nIf I were a coder I'd submit some more details but my skills are limited.\n",
