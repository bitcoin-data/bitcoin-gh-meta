Also help review/test #3753 to expire unconfirming transactions from the memory pool.\n",

I clicked on blockchain.info ( my hotwallet ) frugal option because I was consolidating funds and doing some purchases and now I have a bunch of transactions stacked up all with 0 fees. Oddly with Armory (which I can't get working on Linux ) my transactions would confirm faster even with smaller fees, so this behavior is sorta unexpected. \n\nMy proposal would be to have the ability to bump a transaction somehow by ADDING just the fee. This would lead to positive behavior since it would give ANYONE ( buyer/seller/3rd party ) the opportunity to throw some more coin into the pot to pay for better service. \n\nHow feasible this would be, no clue. Just throwing it out there. I would GLADLY pay to fix the issue if I could now. \n\nMy 3.4cents worth. \n",

One would imagine that there would be some expectation of \"guaranteed\" deliverly based on what one picks when one creates the transaction ? i.e. Very High = next block = 10 minutes . or so .. etc .. down to 0 fees = SOL 2 days please wait.  \n\nTo say .. well dude.. you picked blockchain.info and you decided to go with 0 fees, make a ticket with them, not our problem seems a little uncaring. Which is fine, but it still remains a big mystery .. WHEN WILL THE SHIT CONFIRM ... WHO KNOWS ? Today ? Tomorrow ? Fuck knows !?!  is not a way to run things, \n",
