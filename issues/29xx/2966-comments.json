After some digging, we found out this was likely because of the original pay-to-IP protocol, so that unconfirmed dependencies get sent out to receivers automatically (mental note: the payment protocol could use this too). In its current state it is both useless and inefficient (there is a degree of duplication, if you have wallets with many unconfirmed transactions). The solution was to remove it altogether now, and perhaps later re-introduce it when it's useful, in a saner way (without duplication, for starters).\n",

AcceptWalletTransaction is no longer in main, for example.\n- It would make things more efficient and shorter, if ListUnconfirmedSupportingTransactions would:\n  - Return itself as well, in addition to the dependencies (only if it isn't confirmed already).\n  - Would reverse the result already.\n  - Would return CWalletTx\\* objects (as it's called within a cs_wallet, the pointers should remain valid) directly.\n\nThere are basically three cases (relay, accept, isconfirmed) where you want to do some operation on the dependencies, and then on the object itself. If the list returned by ListUnconfirmed... already contains the object itself, no code duplicate is necessary for those.\n\nI'm not convinced about the pfCompleteSet semantics yet.\n",
