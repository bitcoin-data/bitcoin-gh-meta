It is otherwiese a normal payment-request, which can contain multiple send-to-addresses, right?\n\nCurrently GUI code differentiates between secure and insecure payment-requests, the insecure ones generate one sendcoinsentry for each send-to-address (displayed in the GUI), while secure ones don't do this (one entry and no addresses displayed in the sendcoins dialog).\n\nNow consider an insecure payment-request with 3 send-to-addresses (A, B and C). Current code attaches the payment-request to the first displayed entry (only showing address A), while still adding 2 entries for the other addresses (B and C).\n\nWhat does this result in? Payments to address A, B and C via the payment-request embedded in GUI entry 1 and payments to B and C via the separate GUI entries!\n\nSeems like a heavy bug IMHO?\n",

This keeps sending in one place, which is safe and recognizable.\n\nBut IMO it should always be one sendcoins entry per payment request, even for non-signed/secure one, so that they can be removed in one go. That entry should show the total amount sent so that there is no confusion in how much is sent. The background color could be used to distinguish signed and non-signed ones. It should not be editable in either case.\n\nIt usually doesn't really matter for the user to which address(es) which amount is sent, although it'd be useful to be able to expand it and/or show details for those curious.\n",

But if you are already working on that area too, I'm waiting for your input. Can you take a look at the other related pulls and merge the small ones, so I have an up-to-date branch I can start working with :)?\n",

And we should really get rid of the address book as it is and change it to \"historical addresses\". But that's a different topic (#2429).\n\nAlso we need to introduce per-transaction messages somehow (I think this is already supported in the core?). This would allow showing what the payment request was about in the \"Transactions\" tab instead of abusing the label for that.\n",
