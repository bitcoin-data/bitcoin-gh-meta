As the decision is not just made per-received-block, you could have a valid chain A-B-C, and another chain A-B-C'-D, where D is invalid, in which case C' is reported as best chain instead of C (assuming they have the same amount of work, so the choice should be just as good). Reverting to the old behaviour here would require a hack like reducing the scoring of blocks that have invalid successors for example, but that seems pointless to me, and there are likely other differences as well.\n\nI suppose that during reorganizations, pulltester should just accept any not-invalid block chain with maximum PoW as correct?\n",
