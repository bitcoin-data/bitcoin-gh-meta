Summary of the changes:\n- Use `getheaders` instead of `getblocks` based synchronization, so that the best block in the chain is always known before actually downloading it. No more orphan blocks, ever.\n- Use a moving-window based block downloading mechanism (the heuristics are simple and behave badly for very small blocks, but except for the very beginning of the chain, it works very well).\n- Allow blocks to be stored out-of-order in the block database files.\n- Reorganize the block connection logic significantly.\n- Add a `getblockheader` RPC command.\n",
