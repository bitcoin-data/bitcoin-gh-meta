   "body" : "This removes the code introduced in [#4399](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4399) that attempts to add additional entroy to the OpenSSL PRNG using `RAND_event()`. This is specific to bitcoin-qt running on Windows.\r\n\r\n```\r\nRAND_event() collects the entropy from Windows events such as mouse movements and other user interaction.\r\nIt should be called with the iMsg, wParam and lParam arguments of all messages sent to the window procedure.\r\nIt will estimate the entropy contained in the event message (if any), and add it to the PRNG.\r\nThe program can then process the messages as usual.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBesides BIP70, this is the last place we are directly using OpenSSL in the GUI code. All other OpenSSL usage is in [random.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/random.cpp).\r\n\r\nNote that we are still also still doing other Windows specific gathering using [RandAddSeedPerfmon](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/random.cpp#L268) and [RAND_screen()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/random.cpp#L600) on top of the other generation we do.\r\n\r\nAlso note that if RAND_event returns `0` here (PRNG has **NOT** been seeded with enough data), we're just logging a single message and continuing, which also seems less than ideal.",
