You can layer caches arbitrarily and a fresh flag in a child doesn't tell you about the state of the coin in every ancestor cache. It only directly tells you the state of the coin in the immediate parent cache. In this case, we only indirectly know the state of the grandparent coin due to this happening under the `itUs == cacheCoins.end()` branch.\r\n\r\nWould write this comment more like: \"We can mark parent cache entry FRESH here if child cache entry was FRESH.
