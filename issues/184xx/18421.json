   "body" : "Every time a fresh Bitcoin Core node starts, it makes a DNS query to learn about nodes in the network. This process leaks the privacy of those new nodes: every required DNS server and the corresponding infrastructure would be aware that a new node was spinned up in a particular internet segment.\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to reduce the number of those actors learning about a new node.\r\nThe way to achieve it is to keep DNS server caches updated, so that new nodes rarely hit anything past the early servers.\r\n\r\nTo keep them updated, every reachable node would periodically make all widely used DNS queries, thus, triggering DNS cache updates on the resolvers appearing on their path to the end DNS servers.\r\nThis, obviously, would leak more information about the existence of these reachable nodes. We think this is no big deal, because those nodes are already easy to find, since they are reachable.\r\n\r\nNote that this helps only to those private nodes, which share a subnet with some reachable node running this code.\r\n\r\nIn future, it would be great to analyze the results of those queries against a local AddrMan to check for anomalies.\r\n\r\nThe idea was originally proposed by Greg Maxwell.",
