There are 3 options:\r\n   - Don't ever allow v1 and v2 txs below minrelaytxfee (#26933)\r\n   - Mine everything that makes it into in the mempool (default blockmintxfee to 0). Trim descendant packages <=0 fees, even when the mempool is not full (#27018)\r\n   - Other long-term improvements that address this problem\r\n- [ ] When loading mempool, keep transactions that are below minimum feerate(s) but are CPFP'd. (#26711)\r\n- [ ] Properly assess incentive compatibility, submit transactions with their in-package ancestor sets (#26711)\r\n- [ ] Handle any arbitrary package, even if unsorted (#26711)\r\n- [ ] Relax from child-with-parents to tx-with-ancestors (#26711)\r\n- (safe to expose on P2P)\r\n- [ ] Add v3 rules that make transactions/packages easier to work with (#25038)\r\n- [ ] Introduce a Miner Incentive Compatibility Score rule to RBF (#25038)\r\n- [ ] Enable Package RBF for v3 transactions (#25038)\r\n- [ ] Add Ephemeral Anchors rules for v3 transactions (#26403)\r\n\r\n**P2P, Net Processing**\r\n(Rough outline. Will fill in when PR is open.)\r\n- [ ] BIP 331 (bitcoin/bips/pull/1382)\r\n- [ ] Distinguish between tx failures that {can, cannot} be different in a package. Add a separate rejections cache.\r\n- [ ] Enable more reliable usage of orphanage for ancestor package relay.\r\n- [ ] Negotiate package relay support with peers, gated by config flag (`sendpackages`)\r\n- [ ] Upon receiving an orphan, request a list of its ancestors (`ancpkginfo`) instead of parents by txid. Use that to download missing ancestors.\r\n- [ ] Using package info, download (`getpkgtxns`) and submit packages together.\r\n- [ ] Avoid telling legacy peers about transactions that need package relay to be accepted, to save bandwidth.\r\n- [ ] Default the config flag to true.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
