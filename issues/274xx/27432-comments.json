SQLite can store byte values as BLOBs.\r\n\r\nFair question. There was already some discussion in #24952 about whether to store txids/scriptPubKeys as TEXT or BLOB, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#pullrequestreview-952102140, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1108758629 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1108794823. The two main points were:\r\n\r\n- conversion from this database to json/csv etc should be as simple as possible, and ideally \"select * from utxos\" should already lead to human-readable output. Converting would then be as trivial as a short one-liner `sqlite3 -json utxo.db \"SELECT * FROM utxos\" > utxo.json`, without even having to specify the columns\r\n- more annoying: if using BLOB for the txid, we would have to decide if we store the txid in little or big endian byte order. Big endian would be more natural, as that's how we internally store the txid and also serialize it on the wire, but we _show_ everything in little endian byte order in Bitcoin Core, so a simple \"select hex(txid) from utxos\" would just show the txid in the wrong order, and something like \"reverse(...)\" doesn't exist in SQLite (though some hacky workarounds have been proposed: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1164733346 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1165804095). There remains the possibility to just store the txid in little endian order, but that's the opposite of what we do in leveldb or in the serialization of outpoints, so it could lead to huge confusion for users if not clearly documented. For TEXT the order is clear, it's just stored what is shown everywhere in Bitcoin Core and all wallets, block explorers etc.\r\n\r\nConsidering the scriptPubKey column individually, there is no good reason to use TEXT rather than BLOB, but I went for TEXT mostly for consistency reasons, to not mix TEXT and BLOB in different columns when it's both binary data.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm also very open also for using BLOB instead, it's just a matter of trade-offs.",
