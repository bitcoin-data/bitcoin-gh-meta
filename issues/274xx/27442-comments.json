Assume valid in particular is *optional* because it skips validation on most blocks in the chain \"even though\" that carries a security compromise with it.",

      "body" : "There are already two types of parallel processing involved in the initial block download mechanism:\n* Blocks are downloaded from multiple peers in parallel, fetching one up to a few blocks per peer at a time, from a moving window of the next 1024 blocks.\n* Script validation of blocks is performed in parallel on multiple CPU cores (splitting the work for any one single block). This only has an effect during the final blocks in the chain after the assumevalid point, because before, no script validation takes place at all.\n\nGoing beyond these would require very invasive changes to the protocol, as it's not possible to validate the inputs of block N+1 without having the outputs of block N, as validation depends on the outputs being spent.\n\nIn practice, initial download speed is primarily limited by the cost of maintaining the UTXO set database, not downloading and validation itself. To speed things up, your best bet is increasing the database cache size.\n\nAs @pinheadmz says, for more information on how things work, https://bitcoin.stackexchabge.com is a better resource than the bug tracker.",
