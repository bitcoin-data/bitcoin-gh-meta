It has the property that *every* 64-byte array is a valid encoding for some public key, and every key has approximately $2^{256}$ encodings. Furthermore, it is possible to efficiently generate a uniformly random encoding for a given public key or private key. This is used for the key exchange phase in BIP324, to achieve a byte stream that is entirely pseudorandom, even before the shared encryption key is established.",
