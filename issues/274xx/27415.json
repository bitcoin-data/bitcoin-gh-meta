However, this does not apply to `estimatesmartfee`, which still returns the error.\r\n\r\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is because it's difficult to test client applications on regtest, that would use `estimatesmartfee` on mainnet, but because it requires a lot of transactions before `estimatesmartfee` to work, it's difficult. This related stack exchange question has had a bit of interest:\r\nhttps://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/89607/how-can-i-force-estimatesmartfee-to-return-estimates-on-regtest\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n- A separate flag would also work, like `fallbackestimatefee`\r\n\r\n### Please leave any additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
