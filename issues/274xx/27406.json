   "body" : "Add an option that when passed, will disable hardening options, and pass `--disable-hardening` through to configure. Due to the way we link `libssp` for Windows builds, they now fail (after #27118), if building with depends, and configuring with `--disable-hardening` (Windows is the odd build out here). See: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27118#issuecomment-1492606272.\r\n\r\nThis change would add a depends option such that, if someone wants to build with depends, for Windows, without hardening, they can do so. This may also be useful when building for debugging.",
