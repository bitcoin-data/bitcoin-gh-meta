Not sure if it's worth enabling them at the moment for FreeBSD. It would be awesome to have them on more OS's (e.g. macOS see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541), but AFAIK no one has looked into using them on FreeBSD.\r\n\r\n@kouloumos suggested to use dtrace to generate the tracepoint macros in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26593#pullrequestreview-1376804705 which would unify the process for macOS and Linux. I just saw that there's a dtrace port for FreeBSD too. It would be nice if we could get FreeBSD, macOS and Linux with one unified approach. Until then, maybe leave them disabled?\r\n",
