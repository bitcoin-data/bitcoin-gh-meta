It is also a follow up to #26177.\r\n\r\nIt replaces pull request https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27294, which just moved the constants to a new file, but did not re-declare them as enums.\r\n\r\nThe code move of the chain name constants out of the `chainparamsbase` to their own separate header allows the kernel `chainparams` to no longer include `chainparamsbase`. The `chainparamsbase` contain references to the `ArgsManager` and networking related options that should not belong to the kernel library. Besides this move, the constants are re-declared as enums with helper functions facilitating string conversions.",
