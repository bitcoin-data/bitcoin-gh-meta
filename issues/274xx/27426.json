   "body" : "The [BIP35](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0035.mediawiki) `mempool` P2P message can be used to share the txids in a node's mempool (motivation in BIP35). However it is no longer used (?), is bad for privacy, and we can simplify our P2P code by removing it.\r\n\r\nIt was originally introduced with a protocol version bump from 60001 to 60002 and identification of a node willing to provide this service was based on this new protocol version and the advertisment of `NODE_BLOOM`.\r\n\r\nSubsequently the service was gated behind the `NetPermissionFlags::Mempool` flag, meaning that the original BIP identitifcation method is no longer sufficient to determine that a node will offer this service to you (the node operator must whitelist or otherwise elevate your net permissions before they will respond to it). Therefore I think that it is safe to remove *without* any change in protocol version.\r\n\r\nAt this stage looking for concept ACKs or anybody still actively using this message to find out more about their use-cases.
