   "body" : "Context: I'm [currently experimenting with building our depends with CMake when possible](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commits/depends-cmake) as part of our future transition to CMake. Specifically zmq, libevent, libnatpmp, and miniupnpc all have existing CMake buildsystems. Building them with CMake will allow us to drop several deps that we currently have (autoconf, automake, pkg-config, etc) which would be unfortunate to carry over after the switch-over.\r\n\r\nBut that's not relevant for this PR. This is just a very simple change that makes the above work easier to experiment with as it [adds a needed feature for CMake packages](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/5733dc200004004dcce70eaa105d36ba2e75ce7b#diff-e6ed342a25092e0a6d0308e0bfd826044578847132cc6726ac4afa2ca767b61aR20). It's a no-op for the current builds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFrom commit description:\r\n\r\nThis will allow us to use the existing machinery for filtering by arch, os, debug/release, etc.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following becomes possible for libevent when building with CMake:\r\n\r\n`$(package)_config_opts_release=-DEVENT__DISABLE_DEBUG_MODE`\r\n\r\nNow the define is only set when not building depends with DEBUG=1\r\n\r\n",
