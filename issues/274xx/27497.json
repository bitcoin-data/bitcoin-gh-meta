The organization of in-person events can be itself a source of contention, and I'm speaking here as a former\r\norganizer. While it's voluntary like all other tasks in Bitcoin open-source, there is a lot of subjectivity in the choice of schedule, place and the selection of attendees. Documenting such process will bring more transparency and ensure there is basic accountability of the organisers.\r\n\r\nBeyond, this should minimise CoreDev becoming a tool to discriminate some contributors without legitimate or legal ground, or being used as part of a corporate or cultural capture agenda of the project.",
