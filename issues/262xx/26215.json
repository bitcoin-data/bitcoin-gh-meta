   "body" : "Since commit f08c9fb0c6a799e3cb75ca5f763a746471625beb from PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21726, index  `BlockUntilSyncedToCurrentChain` behavior has been less reliable, and there has also been a race condition in the `coinstatsindex_initial_sync` unit test.\r\n\r\nIt seems better for `BlockUntilSyncedToCurrentChain` to actually wait for the last connected block to be fully processed, than to be able to return before prune locks are set, so this switches the order of `m_best_block_index = block;` and `UpdatePruneLock` statements in `SetBestBlockIndex` to make it more reliable.\r\n\r\nAlso since commit f08c9fb0c6a799e3cb75ca5f763a746471625beb, there has been a race condition in the `coinstatsindex_initial_sync` test. Before that commit, the atomic index best block pointer `m_best_block_index` was updated as the last step of `BaseIndex::BlockConnected`, so `BlockUntilSyncedToCurrentChain` could safely be used in tests to wait for the last `BlockConnected` notification to be finished before stopping and destroying the index.  But after that commit, calling `BlockUntilSyncedToCurrentChain` is no longer sufficient, and there is a race between the test shutdown code which destroys the index object and the new code introduced in that commit calling `AllowPrune()` and `GetName()` on the index object. Reproducibility instructions for this are in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25365#issuecomment-1259744133\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the `coinstatsindex_initial_sync` race condition, even though it will require an additional change to silence TSAN false positives, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26188, after it is fixed. So this partially addresses but does not resolve the bug reporting TSAN errors https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25365.\r\n\r\nThere is no known race condition outside of test code currently, because the bitcoind `Shutdown` function calls `FlushBackgroundCallbacks` not `BlockUntilSyncedToCurrentChain` to safely shut down.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: vasild\r\nCo-authored-by: MarcoFalke",
