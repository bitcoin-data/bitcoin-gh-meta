It would not allow an \"empty\" OP_RETURN but would reduce the required padding from 22 bytes to 5.\r\n\r\nThe functional test is also modified to test the actual case\r\nwe care about: 64 bytes\r\n\r\nRelated mailing list discussions here:\r\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/020995.html\r\nAnd a couple years earlier:\r\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-May/017883.html",
