   "body" : "The `MANDATORY_SCRIPT_VERIFY_FLAGS` constant was introduced in #3843 to distinguish between block consensus rules and relay standardness rules. However it was not actually used in the consensus code path: instead it only means that we consider txs that violated a mandatory rule worth banning (or marking as misbehaving), rather than just rejecting the tx and continuing on.\r\n\r\nSince it's not used for consensus, this PR moves it to `policy/policy.h` next to the related `STANDARD_SCRIPT_VERIFY_FLAGS` and `STANDARD_NOT_MANDATORY_VERIFY_FLAGS` constants.\r\n\r\nIt also updates the list of mandatory flags to include the post-p2sh soft forks that are enforced as consensus rules via `GetBlockScriptFlags()`. The effect of this change is that validation.cpp will report `TxValidationResult::TX_CONSENSUS` for txs that fail dersig/csv/cltv/nulldummy/witness/taproot checks, instead of `TX_NOT_STANDARD`, which in turn adds `Misbehaving(100)` via `MaybePunishNodeForTx` in `net_processing`.",
