   "body" : "When fuzzing on my macOS Mojave laptop, I was unable to instrument the binaries with the command mentioned in the docs:\r\n`\r\n./configure --disable-ccache --disable-shared --enable-tests --enable-fuzz CC=${AFLPATH}/afl-gcc CXX=${AFLPATH}/afl-gcc++\r\n`\r\nThis resulted in the following failure:\r\n```\r\n[-] On Apple systems, 'gcc' is usually just a wrapper for clang. Please use the\r\n    'afl-clang' utility instead of 'afl-gcc'. If you really have GCC installed,\r\n    set AFL_CC or AFL_CXX to specify the correct path to that compiler.\r\n\r\n[-] PROGRAM ABORT : AFL_CC or AFL_CXX required on MacOS X\r\n         Location : edit_params(), afl-gcc.c:159\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I replaced afl-gcc with afl-clang and afl-g++ with afl-clang++, the binaries were properly instrumented.  I made an issue instead of a PR as I wasn't sure whether others had run into this problem or if this was specific to my machine.  If this is reproducible on other Macs, then this should be documented in `fuzzing.md`.",
