   "body" : "```\r\nOur reachability logic was overly complicated, and most likely\r\nincorrect. In particular, we would prefer advertising our IPv4 services\r\nfor peers on Toredo, which would most likely just result in us sending\r\npackets to their Toredo provider.\r\n\r\nThe new logic is a bit simpler:\r\n\r\n- Assume all peers can reach us through IPv4 (same as before)\r\n- If peer is unknown or unroutable, assume they can reach through every\r\n  network (same as before)\r\n- IPv6 peers can reach through IPv6\r\n- Onion peers can reach through Onion\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhat I need help on:\r\n1. Is the \"If peer is unknown or unroutable, assume they can reach through every network\" rule reasonable? I suspect I'm misunderstanding the original intention.\r\n2. Since the unknown and unroutable cases seem to follow the same logic, can we just make them one thing and eliminate the awkward re-purposing of `NET_MAX`?",
