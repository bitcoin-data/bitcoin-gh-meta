   "body" : "This removes the code that supposedly handled the forced relay of txs from a permissioned peer that were rejected from our mempool. The removal should be fine, because it is dead code for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* While `RelayTransaction` enqueues the inv for all peers, the inv is never processed because it can not be found in the mempool. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4a072330763b3ff2d1b5c5b8d30a9517873ac6de/src/net_processing.cpp#L3862-L3866\r\n\r\n* Even if the peers we intended to send the inv to can somehow reply with a getdata to the never-received inv, they won't receive the tx as a reply because it was never added to the \"relay memory\" (`mapRelay`)\r\n\r\nThe dead code is (obviously) untested: https://marcofalke.github.io/btc_cov/total.coverage/src/net_processing.cpp.gcov.html#2574\r\n\r\nThis feature was (intentionally or accidentally) removed in 4d8993b3469915d8c9ba4cd3b918f16782edf0de, which was released in Bitcoin Core 0.13.0. So all currently supported versions of Bitcoin Core ship without this feature. I am not aware of any complaints about this feature or actual documented use-cases. So instead of reviving an unneeded feature, just remove the dead code.",
