   "body" : "UpdateTransactionsFromBlock is called during a re-org. When a re-org occurs, all of the transactions in the mempool may be descendants from a transaction which is in the pre-reorg block. This can cause us to propagate updates, worst case, to every transaction in the mempool.\r\n\r\nBecause we construct a `setEntries setChildren`, which is backed by a `std::set`, it is possible that this algorithm is `O(N log N)`.\r\n\r\nBy using an Epoch visitor pattern, we can limit this to `O(N)` worst case behavior.\r\n\r\nEpochs are also less resource intensive than almost any set option (e.g., hash set) because they are allocation free.\r\n\r\nThis PR is related to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17268, it is a small subset of the changes which have been refactored slightly to ease review. If this PR gets review & merge, I will follow up with more PRs (similar to #17268) to improve the mempool ",
