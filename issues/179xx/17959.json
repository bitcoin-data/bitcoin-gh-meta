   "body" : "This is kind of a prequel to #17921: increases the general quality of the functional test `feature_csv_activation.py` by checking for the specific reject reasons whenever the sending of a block fails. To get the reason, we have to limit the script threads to 1 via the parameter `-par=1`, like it is also done in `feature_cltv.py`:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a654626f076a72416a3d354218d7107571d6caaf/test/functional/feature_cltv.py#L57-L61\r\n\r\nThe commit also fixes a bug that was uncovered with this checks: for the BIP112 version 1 tx tests, txs from `bip112txs_vary_OP_CSV_v1` have been add twice to the list `failed_txs`:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a654626f076a72416a3d354218d7107571d6caaf/test/functional/feature_csv_activation.py#L396-L397\r\n\r\nleading also to a block rejection as expected but for the wrong reason. It seems one of those two tx lists was meant to be `bip112txs_vary_OP_CSV_v1` (without the `_9`) and it was a typo.",
