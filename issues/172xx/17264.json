Person A gives their address to person B, their wallet wallet creates a PSBT, but doesn't sign it. Wallet A then calls `walletprocesspsbt` which signs it and _spontaneously adds the master_fingerprint and bip32 path_. Same issue with `walletcreatefundedpsbt`.\r\n> \r\n> Adding `bip32_derivs` should probably be opt-in.\r\n\r\nIn practice I find this default quite annoying because I forget it and end up with a confused hardware wallet.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, in the multisig example I provided, it's actually essential for the other side to know the derivation details (in addition to an xpub). This allows them to check that change is going to an address you can still co-sign for (because the spending policy is unchanged except for an index).",
