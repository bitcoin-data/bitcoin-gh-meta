   "body" : "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am on Ubuntu 16.04, with the latest version of Bitcoin Core, synced and working.\r\n\r\nI would like to know why is there a little delay of approximately 1 sec, sometimes more, before a received transaction appear on the console when we run for instance `bitcoind -printoconsole`, if I check the tx on blockchain.com for instance, I can see that the transaction were received 1 or 2 sec before I even see it on my node, why is there a delay ? I have try on another ubuntu server with a super fast connection and it's the same thing. By the way, it's the same thing when I send a Tx, it's submitted and appear on the network 1-2 secs after.\r\n\r\nSo my question is why is there such a delay even on a node ? Is it possible to reduce it ? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance !\r\n",
