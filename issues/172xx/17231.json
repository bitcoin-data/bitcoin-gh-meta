   "body" : "The ancient \"darwin-4.9.1\" profile has long been used to match against clang, which prior to version 9, reported 4.9.1 as its version when invoking \"clang++ -dumpversion\". Presumably this was a historical compatibility quirk related to Apple's switch from gcc to clang.\r\n\r\nThis was \"fixed\" in clang 9.0, so that -dumpversion reports the real version. Unfortunately that had the side-effect of breaking the (brittle) boost compiler detection.\r\n\r\nMove to the seemingly more-correct \"clang-darwin\" profile, which passes the checks and builds correctly.\r\n\r\nAlso switch to using ar rather than libtool for archiving, as it's what the clang-darwin profile expects to be using.\r\n\r\nNote that because this is using a different profile, some of the final command-line arguments end up changing. Those changes look sane at a glance.",
