On really low-end ARM server (I'm using [this](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-n2-with-2gbyte-ram/) for example) the first times you try to auto-complete via ssh it takes a few seconds and that's just annoying.

I just meant it was a latency issue. Yes, auto-completing via RPC requests would work, it just would be slower on low-end hardware.\r\n",
