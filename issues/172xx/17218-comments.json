Add your new macro with a name like `LOG_CATEGORY`, to be clear that it is a macro and not something that evaluated like a normal function.\r\n2. Leave `LogPrint` alone, mark it deprecated and add a note like \"LOG_CATEGORY is preferred over LogPrint in new code as a more performant alternative\"\r\n\r\nSeparately after that, I do not think it would take a lot of work to replace instances of `LogPrint` and remove it. We could start with a simple [scripted-diff](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#scripted-diffs) to replace simple variable references that obviously don't have side effects.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit grep -l LogPrint | xargs sed -i 's/LogPrint\\((BCLog::[A-Z]\\+, \"[^\"]\\+\"\\(, [A-Za-z_]\\+\\)*)\\)/LOG_CATEGORY\\1/g'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for organizing these changes, I might consider closing this PR, and instead adding the new macro directly where you intend to use it in #16688.",
