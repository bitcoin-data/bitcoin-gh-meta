Always nice to get rid of dead code that is unlikely to be used in the future.\r\n\r\nIf you want to find more dead code you might want to look at coverage after running the unit tests, the functional tests, the benchmarks and say a full IBD with coverage . Code paths not covered by such a run could then be investigated manually to see if it is genuinely dead code or just hard-to-reach code.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can find a subset of all unused functions in #16967 (see \"Functions that are both unused and untested\" and \"Functions that are unused outside of the testing code\").",
