In modern times of WSL, multi-arch, and qemu-user, being able to execute binaries doesn't mean it's not a cross build. Build systems should not try to execute anything they produce for the target.\r\n- Removes this specific test-case (but would need to investigate where the result is used, depending on what monotonic time is used for; if it's only for benchmarking/tests, we don't care, just hardwire it to false)\r\n- Replace this specific test case with a check that doesn't trigger the problem. E.g. do a static link of libc so that the conftest doesn't need an extra dll.\r\n",
