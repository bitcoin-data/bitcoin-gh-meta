   "body" : "We should have a unit test which covers the case that an ancestor is represented more than once.\r\n\r\nCurrently, suppose that you have a transaction set like:\r\n\r\nTxn B: A3 -> {B0, B1}\r\nTxn C: B1 -> {C0, C1, C2}\r\nTxn D: {C0, B0} -> {D0}\r\n\r\n\r\nThen D's ancestor count should be 2, but it's possible to make an error and over count A (and maybe B) as an ancestor twice (once via A3->B1->C0, once by A3->B0).\r\n\r\nThis is distinct from a transaction such as:\r\n\r\nTxn E: {B0, B1} -> {E0, E1, E2, E3}\r\n\r\nBecause it'd be easy to implement a set of hashes from the inputs rather than properly from all the ancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current code is of course correct, but this came up in testing a change that it wasn't covered.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, wallet_labels.py is the only test which, probabilistically, checks this.
