   "body" : "This introduces a new `randomenv` module that queries varies non-cryptographic (and non-RNG) sources of entropy available on the system; things like user IDs, system configuration, time, statistics, CPUID data.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that these provide a fallback in scenarios where system entropy is somehow broken (note that if system entropy *fails* we will abort regardless; this is only meant to function as a last resort against undetected failure). It includes some data sources OpenSSL currently uses, and more.\r\n\r\nThe separation between random and randomenv is a bit arbitrary, but I felt that all this \"non-essential\" functionality deserved to be separated from the core random module.",
