The columns include some basics such as: date, category, amount, tx_fee, block_height, block_hash, etc.\r\n\r\nIf `listsinceblock` resumes from an older state, many `getblock` transactions are done just to get the height where it's unknown (I do cache it, but when the wallet interface starts up and scans for any new tx's since the last block, there can be a couple of those). I think it's relevant to store as a basic attribute to any incoming transactions.\r\n\r\nIt would really be nice not have to do so many lookups unnecessarily. That's all.\r\n",
