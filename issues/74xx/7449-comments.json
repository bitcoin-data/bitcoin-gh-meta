Gavin said that nodes which does not accept incoming connections are not solution but a problem but I just partialy agree, on countless occassions my node connected to some other nodes and those other nodes started syncing with it. So node that can accept incoming connections synced from my node which can't accept incoming connections, which one was more useful? If I could specify maxoutgoingconnections=64 or 256 that means my node would have a higher chance to sync up other nodes, detect forks and not fall victim to Sybil attack.\n",
