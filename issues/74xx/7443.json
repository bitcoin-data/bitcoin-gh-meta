   "body" : "Satoshi's white paper is currently available on bitcoin.org, but without any clear licensing information, which makes it difficult for publishers to re-publish.\n\nSome research shows however that the white paper is licensed under MIT. Satoshi posted the paper in the original repository on SourceForge, as part of bitcoin-0.15. That release had an MIT license attached which covers \"associated documentation files\". This clearly establishes an MIT license for the white paper. See https://web.archive.org/web/20091127010808/http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/\n\nI request that we add the white paper back into the bitcoin repository, under the same MIT license that Satoshi had chosen. This will clarify licensing for anyone wanting to include the white paper in any publication and help spread the white paper more broadly. The white paper belongs in this repository, just as Satoshi intended. It is the clearest documentation of the philosophy and origins of this project and it should be part of \"doc\". \n\nThe paper is 184 KB, adding only 0.2% to the repository size.\n",
