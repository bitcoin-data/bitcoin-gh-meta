   "body" : "I was calling the `getnetworkhashps` and `getmininginfo` RPCs via some Java code the other day and realized that the hashrate is getting pretty close to overflowing a signed 64-bit integer. Hence, I decided to check how `bitcoind` handles things (with some help from Luke Jr) and it turns out that a signed 64-bit integer (`int64_t`) is used indeed (at least in `mining.cpp` (see [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rpc/mining.cpp))) -- potentially elsewhere as well?\n\nAs you all know, the max value for a 64-bit signed integer is `2^63-1`, or about `9223372036854775807`. With the sharp increase in hashrate these past few weeks, we seem to be up to about 12.5% of the datatype's full capacity at this point. To illustrate this:\n\n`9 223 372 036 854 775 807 (maximum value of a 64-bit signed integer)`\n`1 126 516 160 438 311 092 (current network hashrate -- as of 2016-02-07 12:20:07 UTC)`\n\nAccording to historical data, the value could wrap in maybe 1 - 1.5 years (or however long it'll take for a 1-order-of-magnitude increase in hashrate).\n\nLuke Jr advised me to create a PR on this in the `#bitcoin-dev` IRC channel the other day. However, as I don't know the codebase that well and am not very well-versed in C++ specifics & caveats, I decided to create this issue instead. \n\nMaybe someone smarter can take a quick look at this and prove me wrong if that's the case :).\n",
