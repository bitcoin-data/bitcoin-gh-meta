If you tried different storage, then it is possibly a problem with the CPU overheating or memory corrupting.\n\nThat doesn't mean there is no software issue, but if it is it is something obscure like interaction between a specific file system and leveldb. These are very hard to diagnose at the least. No one was ever able to, and the pattern of occurences doesn't reveal much either (see issues tagged with \"Data corruption\").\n\nBut reindexing is actually easy: to reindex pass `-reindex` on the command line.\n",
