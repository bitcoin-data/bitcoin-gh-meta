I just think it's a waste, something that should ideally have been addressed as part of the review process for #6088 (which already superceeded PRs implementing similar commands, this didn't come out of the blue).\n\nNow, if we would merge this, we would have to carry two RPC calls that largely overlap in functionality for a while, which is a maintenance burden.\n\n**Edit:**\n\n> For me stating that fundrawtransaction has part the of functionality so it should be extended does not apply. This is a more concise, obvious and library friend way to create transactions in a single RPC call.\n\nDevil's advocate: absolutely, but isn't the \"long way around\" more flexible? Does combining the intermediate steps, all having a limited but well-defined tasks, allow doing combined operations that could never all be part of a single monolithic command?\n",
