This has the added advantage of keeping the dependencies separate from any other vcpkg dependencies you might install in the future (something which does become a problem if you use vcpkg a lot).\r\n\r\nAnd in fact you don't need to call vcpkg at all since it will add tasks to `msbuild` to look for a manifest file and call the install command as part of the build. \r\n\r\nIf you can confirm whether or not this is your problem I can fix the instructions to note the required vcpkg version.",
