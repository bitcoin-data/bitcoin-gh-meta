I am not exactly sure how to check the version number, neither on git nor ok vcpkg. I dont know yet exactly how to use vcpkg. I tried some install and some, it did seem to hang bash a little bit, so I am not even sure if it installed properly. I may have to get some kind of libevent library working later.\r\n\r\nThe change log for libevent seems out of date. The version mentioned in there is 2.1.8-stable (22 January 2017)\r\n\r\nCould you advise me how to figure out the exact version of libevent ?\r\n\r\nWhich version of libevent would be needed to compile and link for bitcoin ?",
