The goal of this change is to allow to override policy reject reasons while also giving the user more flexibility than an \"on-off\" `-acceptnonstdtxn` setting. The reason that `-acceptnonstdtxn` is disabled is that it wouldn't be safe to turn on in normal operation for the default user. So I think the flexibility to have a per-tx override without restarting the node is useful. Maybe even outside the primary use case of one-off manual sends.\r\n\r\nSimply having broader categories (or even a single category) doesn't solve the problem that policy changes between versions.",

Then, wrt maintainability, it still seems simpler to just set policy on/off entirely?\r\n\r\n> Another option would be for `testmempoolaccept` to continue and collect all policy-failures on the way and return all of them instead of only the first? This would make an on/off switch safe again, I believe.\r\n\r\nThat sounds nice. Although I'd say it's tricky to implement - what we might consider individual policies aren't really mutually exclusive and we usually stop after the first violation because later checks would break / say the same thing but be more expensive.

Also, this doesn't change performance of mempool acceptance logic if not enabled. Yes, it might run checks that aren't mutually exclusive, but what is the problem with that if the user explicitly asks to do that.
