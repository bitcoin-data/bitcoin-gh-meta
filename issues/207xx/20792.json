Should they be manually installed? If so, let's amend the build instructions accordingly.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the compile error. Boost has not been installed at this point.\r\n\r\n> 1>------ Build started: Project: libbitcoin_wallet, Configuration: Release x64 ------\r\n> 1>wallet.cpp\r\n> 1>D:\\dev\\bitcoin\\src\\optional.h(10,10): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'boost/optional.hpp': No such file or directory\r\n> 1>Done building project \"libbitcoin_wallet.vcxproj\" -- FAILED.\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\nCloned from github today. \r\n\r\n`git checkout v0.21.0rc3`\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\nWindows 10 x64\r\nVisual Studio 2019 v 16.7.7\r\n\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue? What is your operating system and its version? If Linux, what is your desktop environment and graphical shell? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n\r\nProbably just needs an update to the Windows build documentation? \r\n\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n",
