Maybe you can provide some information in to how you were using the GUI, what network you were syncing to, etc..\r\n\r\nCannot replicate on a macOS Mojave 10.14.6 fresh install VM. Downloaded the `bitcoin-0.20.1-osx.dmg` from `bitcoincore.org` was able to start syncing on `mainnet` and `testnet` with no crashes.\r\n\r\nNote for those who want to run a 10.14.6 machine on a modern macOS machine: this version of macOS is no longer available from the App Store and the `.dmg` that can be found on the internet will not open with the `.pkg` contents on macOS Big Sur 11. Instead, it can be grabbed with the following tool: http://dosdude1.com/mojave/#downloads\r\n\r\n",

I don't know what happened at that block, but every time I use that snapshot, it will crash.  \r\nUnfortunately, I cannot upload that snapshot (it's over 200GB).  \r\nSo I give up, use an earlier backup instead, and everything works.  \r\nFortunately I made a backup, otherwise I have to sync the data from the beginning, which will take quite a few days...  \r\nMy conclusion about this issue: it's hard to replicate it, so I close it. However, when it occurs, maybe the only solution is to sync the data from the beginning if you do not have a backup.  ",
