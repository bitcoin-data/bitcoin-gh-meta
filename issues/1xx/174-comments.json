Once he controls all connections...\nPossibilities for the attacker are :\n- make the user believe he has been paid by sending a transaction from already spent coins on the real nodes\n- generate fake blocks for confirmations and fake transactions\n  So, you can't really trust 100% what is displayed by your bitcoin client ?\n\nBy fetching addresses in http, it adds an additional risk :\n- a user can send coins directly to the attacker\n  I admit it is a big risk, but it should not block the possibility to fetch an address even if the connection is not secured. However, the user should be warn in this case and decide what to do with a manual action (you won't send 500BTC that way do you ?).\n\nA way to do it securely would be to send the fetch request to connected first level nodes and compare results (or shasum to shorten the message). But, bitcoin network is not ready/designed for trusted nodes.\n\nAnother solution is to have a centralized site for address fetching. If a think a centralized solution was good i would already have linked my patch with my domain :p. Maybe, I could fetch both from a direct request to the website and make a second request to one of the trusted ip (declared like bitseed ips) ?\n",
