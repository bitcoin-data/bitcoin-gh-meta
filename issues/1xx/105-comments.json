The problem rests with the ability of people to more easily run multiple nodes on the network.  This should be discouraged as it increases load on IRC, etc.  Anyone who has enough ability to want an alternate port for whatever reason can easily do this with firewall rules or with a compilation with the above commits.  \n",
