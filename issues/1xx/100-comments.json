I'm not exactly sure how this thing works, seeing as I haven't cloned it yet, but I'd assume that there's a way to check which language they are compiling/using. (I'm thinking #ifdef GERMAN blabla #endif, or something of the sort.) Seeing as Microsoft Excel doesn't prompt the user which to use and guesses based on language (unlike OpenOffice <3) this would have to be implanted. And as a final note, some language versions of Excel don't play nice with Unicode.\n",

It's rather unfriendly to tell all non-English users to just go into a text editor and go do it themselves. If you want to have a currency, especially one spanning across multiple countries, user friendliness and making it work in as many places as possible is a must.\n\n> sneak:\n> CSV is not necessarily intended to be human readable.\n\nThat's the problem, it is. If the specification was just \"use . for a decimal separator,\" there'd be no problem. The problem is some people said \"hey, we want , for the decimal separator,\" so they did. \n\n> sneak:\n> Europeans writing floats in source code use the period as a decimal, because that's the spec.\n\nBut why not the other way around? Wouldn't _you_ be confused if you had to code in a language that used , as the decimal separator and period as the argument separator? Eventually, you'd probably be able to understand it, correct? The real problem is that although _humans_ would understand it, programs that load CSV may not.\n\nOverall, I really have to say that it matters little, but I'd be really annoyed if I had to do more than my fair share just because a couple of people were too lazy to allow me to select what I want.
