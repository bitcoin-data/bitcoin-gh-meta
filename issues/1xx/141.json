   "body" : "While there is no hard consensus on what to do with CPU mining inside bitcoin, in general, I think most people will agree that 4way can go.\n\nThis implementation (with performance enhancements) lives on in cpuminer.  bitcoin's 4way was only available on *nix, while cpuminer's 4way works on Windows and Linux.\n\nI conclude that, if you are really serious about CPU mining, you are more likely to use ufasoft's CPU miner, or mine, and so we don't need multiple implementations inside bitcoin.\n",
