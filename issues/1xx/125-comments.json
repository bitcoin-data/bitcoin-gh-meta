      "body" : "I forgot to write my motivation for the patch. I wrote it because I got tired of having to sift through hundreds of \"IRC got xxx\" messages while I was trying to debug some other changes I was making. Plus I was concerned about the size of the debug.log file - after running for only 12 hours, the file was hundreds of megabytes. The file only gets truncated on startup, and then only if you specify the -debug flag - which increases the log activity.\n\nI haven't looked at boost::log, but how easy is it to incorporate into the existing code? One of the big advantages (IMO) of this patch is the fact that it fits into the existing code, which makes it less of a pain to migrate to the new logging system.\n",

The sheer number of messages in a complex system begs for something like what jhyslop has submitted.\n\nBIND uses logging channels, giving you the ability to mask-in and mask-out certain types of messages.  syslog has LOG_{ERR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG}.  Linux kernel network drivers have a facility (NETIF_MSG_xxx) which permits enabling or disabling of high volume per-packet messages, enabling or disabling of PHY-related messages (\"link up!\", \"link down!\"), enabling or disabling of driver probe detail messages, etc.\n\nI think it would be useful to selectively enable or disable (a) bitcoin's per-packet logging, (b) P2P logging in general, (c) RPC logging in general.\n",
