I'm **not** accusing you of this, just speaking generally.\n\nSo, this commit should really be two, either (a) convert to autotools then (b) move files around, or (a) move files around under old build system, verify that it builds and works under old build system, then (b) convert to autotools.  That enables the reviewers to easily review the \"move files around\" commit and verify that it truly includes -zero- code changes.\n\nAlso, in terms of marketing, I think it is a bit misleading to call it the \"GNUification of bitcoin\"  It might make people think bitcoin is changing its license from MIT to GPL, at first glance.\n\nThe more technically accurate description is \"convert bitcoin build system to autotools\" or similar.  If we imported your git commit as-is into bitcoin.git, the one-line summary of your commit is \"The aim of this commit is mostly that of GNUification for bitcoin\" which does not tell the reader anything.\n",
