   "body" : "Hi,\n\nMy build broke saying:\n\n```\nnet.cpp:8: fatal error: miniupnpc/miniwget.h: No such file or directory\n```\n\nSo I fixed it and made a patch. The patch was made and tested against `v0.3.21` on a GNU/Linux, but it should be good to apply on `master` as well. Also, it was not tested with USE_UPNP=1, but I don't see why it should fail.\n\nYours,\nAmir\n",
