So in terms of the time that the blocks were created, you can infer that from the time the transaction happened.  If all you care about is which blocks came before which blocks, then you don't even have to look at the transaction times, just their order.\n",

This will ensure that the next time you run the command with the new lastblock value you won't miss any transactions that have now reached N confirmations.  But it will allow applications that want to specially handle transactions with <N confirmations to do so as well.  So this command neatly hits both use-cases.\n\n**Edit:** I've also rebased against master.\n",
