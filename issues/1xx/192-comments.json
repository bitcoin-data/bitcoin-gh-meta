You want a \"CAddress factory\", that will create one or more CAddress's from a DNS lookup.  Supporting a multiple-address lookup from _inside_ a singleton address object is awkward, because DNS lookups have a one-to-many relationship between DNS names and addresses.\n\nThe \"create higher nIndex, until address returned is invalid\" is unusual for this reason, and the code should be refactored.\n\nYou want a helper (CAddressFactory?) that returns one or more CAddress objects, from a DNS lookup.  Because a DNS lookup may produce multiple addresses, this cannot be inside the CAddress implementation itself.\n",

Satoshi reserved space for it in the P2P protocol address storage area, and it will be needed in years to come, to connect some clients.\n\nAs such, please separate hostname and port into two distinct function parameters / variables, and do not combine them into a single string \"host:port\", only to be parsed and separated in NameLookup()\n\nRationale:\n1) It is recommended due to IPv6 that this convention be avoided.  IPv6 addresses contain a colon, implying that proper parsing requires users to specify a bracketed string, if you are specifying a port:  [0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7]:8333.  For this reason, all new APIs -- most notably, libc function getaddrinfo(3) -- always keep hostname and port separate.\n\n2) gethostbyname(3) is deprecated, and we need to switch to getaddrinfo(3).  The commit is fine as-is, and relies on a well-tested API, so I did not request revision.  But long term, again due to IPv6, it is recommended that all applications use getaddrinfo(3).  This function is supported in winsock, freebsd (macos) and linux, all our supported platforms.\n\nSo, separate hostname and port, and you're golden with this commit.\n\nThanks.\n",
