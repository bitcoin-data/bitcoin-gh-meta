All these are the sorts of changes we -do- want, but in general you're wrapping way too many major changes into a single pull request.  The right way to do this is with small, incremental changes, in separate pull requests that can be evaluated on their own merits, after being discussed on the forums.\n\nFor example, everyone has their own opinion on source file placement, and these changes tend to have low payback, and are low priority.  See discussion in thread http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=5813.0\n\nOn libbitcoin:  everybody wants it, but any libbitcoin API should be informed by some applications actively using the library, i.e. real needs demonstrated in the field.  So, we're all for a libbitcoin, but we tend to be collectively wary of Grand API Designs unless you already have a lot of experience with the existing codebase and concepts :)  Nothing personal.\n\nSpeaking incrementally, the first rev of autotools should just get the existing stuff working on all platforms.  That means no libtool, which just adds complexity for no reason (because libbitcoin does not yet exist).\n\nBaby steps!  The first reaction of -every- programmer upon meeting bitcoin is \"I want to rewrite it!\"  But the dev team must be conservative and keep everything running and debuggable and backwards compatible.  Big pulls and major reorgs offer little payback for a large potential for breakage.\n",
