   "body" : "I think RPC access is important enough that it should be enabled by default. This would allow greater integration with other applications.\n\nFor instance, we could support Bitcoin URIs (issue #14) by having a `bitcoin openuri` command that would open the \"Send Coins\" dialog box with the address and amount pre-populated.\n\nI therefore propose the a small changes:\n- The `-server` flag is deprecated and the server config option is considered on (1) by default.\n- A `-noserver` flag added to explicitly turn off the RPC server at the command line.\n- If there is an `rpcpassword` field in the `bitcoin.conf` file, that password is used.\n- Otherwise, a random password is generated on startup, and placed in a file called `bitcoin.password` (user readable only).\n\nIf people think this is a good idea, I can put together a patch for this.\n",
