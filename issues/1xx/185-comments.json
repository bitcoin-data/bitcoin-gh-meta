This write operation then blocks, presumably waiting for the atomic operation to be completed.\n\nI'm not sure what a good solution would be. I tried a workaround here: https://github.com/javgh/bitcoin/commit/1049dc625f7b1d695092de72ad0c5bb7d329edfa\nThat contains a method to top up the key pool separately and does though before starting the atomic db operation.\n",
