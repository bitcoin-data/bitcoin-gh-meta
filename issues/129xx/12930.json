   "body" : "In playing with some of the large transaction / full block functional tests, I found some of the construction logic for large transactions to be a bit confusing. In particular, you could make a 'large transaction', but the actual size was not  exact in any way, making more advanced testing harder to reason about. This change allows customization in number of outputs / size of output to add to transactions (via `gen_return_txouts`) and allows creating a tx with a particular target size simply with\r\n```\r\ndef create_tx_with_size(node, target_vsize)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows much more flexible testing of certain scenarios, for example, easily filling the mempool to an exact size, with various size txs and fees (tx radius is size). \r\n![mempool2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14220652/38543965-29a69a12-3cb7-11e8-9fe8-e2b0e5695347.png)\r\n\r\nAnd from there, evaluating something like `getblocktemplate` selection:\r\n![mempoolwithgbt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14220652/38544016-4766b0f0-3cb7-11e8-8b71-16f7504a1c58.png)\r\n\r\nThere is a tests of this functionality [in this commit](https://github.com/conscott/bitcoin/commit/fb4a98fe0e410d7747fd53bb0c646c84c7a65e79) but I was thinking to not include this in the PR because it's just testing what was added to `test_framework`. This tests was also used to generate the mempools above, and graphed with a [draw mempool](https://github.com/conscott/draw_mempool) tool I have been working on. \r\n\r\nI wanted to get feedback before possibly updating / adding more functional tests to use this kind of construction. @jnewbery @MarcoFalke ?\r\n\r\n",
