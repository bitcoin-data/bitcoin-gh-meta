If an empty string \\\"\\\" is passed in, only unlabeled addresses are selected. I do not see a clear reason to not allow \\\"\\*\\\" as a wildcard argument, to select from all addresses - labeled and unlabeled. Is there a good reason to keep this legacy restriction?",

I guess we will just have to exclude BTC from our platform as waiting for lengthy times (some times hours) will not work when using the sendtoaddress plus the high fees for every transaction.

What used to be called an account is now just called a label, and you can still apply labels to addresses.\r\n\r\nWhat was removed was runtime code for \"sending from\" labels, and code for filtering balances with labels, because it's error prone to refer to transaction outputs (coins) in the wallet by address or label. Addresses don't uniquely identify outputs, and not all outputs have addresses, so accounting based on addresses can't really be sound and is likely to lead to mistakes.\r\n\r\nBut since the wallet is storing exactly the same information as before, it's still possible for software using the wallet API to use indirectly use labels ~for coin selection when creating transactions or~ computing balances. Instead of referring to transaction outputs indirectly by label it will have to look them up with an api like `listtransactions` and refer to them precisely.\r\n\r\nEDIT (correction above): accounts/labels were never actually used for coin selection when creating transactions. Accounts were just passively stored as part of address and transaction metadata and only used for computing balances.",

It actually did not affect coin selection at all, but just added a [`mapValue[\"fromaccount\"]`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/794e55be104ccbfbf92569fa7572d2d4b0b4ad7c/src/wallet/wallet.h#L317) string field to outgoing transaction metadata stored in the wallet. Then it would treat transactions with this field as debits when computing account balances.\r\n\r\nThis means that replicating previous account functionality by just calling different RPC now should actually be simpler than what I suggested https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12952#issuecomment-552523337, because it wouldn't require doing any coin selection when spending, or having to determine whether specific outputs had been spent while computing balances. It would just require associating label names with outgoing transactions, which could be done for example by putting label names in one of the transaction [comment fields](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/794e55be104ccbfbf92569fa7572d2d4b0b4ad7c/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp#L522-L526).\r\n",

I will look into lables and see if there is a way we can migrate our current RPC accounts interface to labels.\r\n\r\n@cryppty you probably should be careful about trying to replicate old account functionality too closely, because the balances it computed could be misleading. But for reference, if you wanted to port previous RPC client code using accounts without changing functionality, I think you'd basically:\r\n\r\n1. Change previous rpc client code using `setaccount` or similar RPC methods tagging addresses with account names to instead tag them with _label_ names\r\n1. Change previous rpc client code sending from an account with `sentfrom` or `sendmany` to instead store the \"from account\" in the transaction _comment_ field\r\n1. Change previous rpc client code that was calling `move` to instead store credits and debit adjustments to the two accounts externally\r\n1. Change previous rpc client code requesting account balances to instead list transactions, count transaction output amounts with matching _label_ names as credits, and count transaction payment amounts with matching _comment_ fields as debits, and compute the sum adding any `move` amounts as adjustments.\r\n1. Change previous rpc client code that was calling `getaccountaddress` to instead look up the most recently generated address with a matching label and use that address if it hasn't received a payment, otherwise generate a fresh address with the label",
