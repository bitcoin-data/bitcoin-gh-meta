Whether that policy should be automatically enforced by a linter.\r\n\r\nMy impression is that this PR seems to have been created out of a displeasure with (3), and overreacting by changing (1) and (2) as well.\r\n\r\nAs for the guideline itself, I think there was no need for change. The don't-reinclude-in-cpp-what-h-already-includes approach has been in use since #2767 and was made explicit in #10575 with many ACKs. I think that is a very reasonable approach: the .h and .cpp file together are one module, with the .cpp containing the non-public part. The only reason I see for changing that policy is if we want to encourage occasional use of `iwyu`, which AFAIK does not support that policy. However, for now it does not seem very straightforward to use.\r\n\r\n",
