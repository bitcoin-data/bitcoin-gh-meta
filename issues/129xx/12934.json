In the meantime - the net layer may continue servicing other nodes that do not have pending asynchronous validation requests.\r\n\r\nThe ProducerConsumerQueue() was left sufficiently generic so that it may be interposed  in other places where separation of components via asynchronous message passing might make sense from a design perspective.",
