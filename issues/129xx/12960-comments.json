See [WhyIWYU](https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use/blob/master/docs/WhyIWYU.md) for various considerations and rationale, and consider running the [IWYU](https://include-what-you-use.org/) tool to automatically remove unneeded includes and add/remove forward declarations.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, it is a little awkward right now to use iwyu with bitcoin, though I regularly do, and I previously posted instructions at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11878#issuecomment-351610027. It might be possible to add some build system support that would make iwyu easier to run, but I'd have to look into that.",
