A few high-level comments:\r\n\r\n- `create_tx_with_size()` is defined, but doesn't seem to be used anywhere.\r\n- you're doing a lot of manual transaction construction and byte wrangling. Is it possible to use the `CTransaction` class in messages.py to achieve this more easily\r\n- I much prefer docstrings (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for commenting functions than a block comment above (it makes the function stand out more, and the comment is available in interactive sessions).\r\n- I think the new code can be moved around a bit. Pure util functions should live in util.py in the `Utility Functions` section. Transaction and block building functions should live in blocktools.py",
