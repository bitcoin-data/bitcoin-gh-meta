Instead it sorts the mempool by ancestor count first (so all transactions with no ancestors appear before their descendants), and by feerate of the transaction second (not feerate including ancestors).  The mining sort order is based on sorting transactions by their feerate with ancestors (which is done in one of the mempool.mapTx indices), and then updating that feerate-with-ancestors calculation as transactions are selected for inclusion.\r\n\r\nSo a simple approximation of the mining calculation would to walk the mempool in the ancestor-feerate-order, and tally up the weight of transactions as you go.  In order to get it precise, though, you'd probably just want to invoke `CreateNewBlock()` directly.\r\n\r\n",

Instead it sorts the mempool by ancestor count first (so all transactions with no ancestors appear before their descendants), and by feerate of the transaction second (not feerate including ancestors). \r\n\r\nI wanted to ask about that. Thanks for clarifying -- I would like to avoid the block creation code, as I think it results in side effects that are not desirable (I believe early prototypes of `testrawtransaction` had issues due to trying to reuse that functionality). I could be mistaken. Anyway, that's a pity. I was hoping there was a clean way to get the transactions in order. I also found out that the ancestor stuff actually plays a big role in blocks, so I may need to take that into account after all.\r\n\r\nAfter making this PR, I realized I was a bit hasty. I need to do proper profiling before making a serious proposal. I'm considering closing, but I think it's fine since it has `[WIP]` tag...?",
