This github issue tracker is for reporting bugs or issues with the Bitcoin Core software, rather than for asking questions about the Bitcoin protocol. I suggest you try the Freenode #bitcoin IRC channel or https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/ - there are lots of very knowledgeable people on both who would be happy to help answer your question.",
