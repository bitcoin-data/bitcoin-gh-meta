   "body" : "This PR makes two main changes:\r\n1) Adds a new RPC `newkeypool` which will entirely flush and refill the keypool.\r\n2) When upgradewallet is called on old, non-HD wallets upgrading them to HD, we now always flush the keypool and generate a new one, to immediately start using the HD generated keys.\r\n\r\nThis PR is motivated by a number of users with old, pre-compressed-key wallets upgrading them and being confused about why they still can't generate p2sh-segwit or bech32 addresses -- this is due to uncompressed keys remaining in the keypool post-upgrade and being illegal in these newer address formats. There is currently no easy way to flush the keypool other than to call `getnewaddress` a hundred/thousand times or an ugly hack of using a `sethdseed` call.",
