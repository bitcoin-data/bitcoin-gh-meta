   "body" : "Fuzz test coverage was added around the ExtractDestination(s) functions in\r\na29f522ba4aa71582b54025c5682b4c1687ae9f3. This commit contained an incorrect\r\nassertion that the number of required signatures in a multisig script was equal\r\nto the number of addresses. This is incorrect, as for an m-of-n multisig, m <= n.\r\n\r\na29f522ba4aa71582b54025c5682b4c1687ae9f3 also had an incorrect assertion on\r\nthe maximum number of public keys per multisig. It checked that the number of\r\nkeys was less than or equal to 16. This is incorrect, as it should be <= 20\r\n(see MAX_PUBKEYS_PER_MULTISIG).\r\n\r\nBoth of these incorrect assertions are fixed in this commit accordingly.\r\n\r\nNote: this is sort of moot because this behavior is deprecated and these\r\nfuzz tests are slated for removal in v23 when the deprecation period for\r\n-deprecatedrpc=addresses ends. However, for correctness and just in case,\r\nit's fixed here.\r\n\r\nNoticed here: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=39152\r\nMoot because this PR #22650 gets rid of all this code anyways\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",
