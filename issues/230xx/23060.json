   "body" : "This increases the minimum required compiler versions to Clang 7 and GCC 8.1. This has been split out of #20744 (migration to `std::filesystem`), as it's also a requirement for some other changes, such as #20452 or #20457 which want to make use of `std::from_chars`. As well as #20435, which is also `std::filesystem` related. Given that the `std::filesystem` changes are moving ahead, splitting out this change to let other PRs take advantage of the new requirements seems worthwhile.\r\n\r\nClang 7 has been available in Debian since [Stretch (oldoldstable)](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/clang-7) and in Ubuntu since [Bionic (18.04)](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic-updates/clang-7). GCC 8 has been available in Debian since [Buster (oldstable)](https://packages.debian.org/buster/gcc) and in Ubuntu since [Bionic (18.04)](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/gcc-8). CentOS 8 also packages GCC 8.\r\n\r\nThe CI changes here give us one build with GCC 8, and another using Clang 7 on top of libc++.\r\n\r\nNote that the minimum required libc++ in dependencies.md is unchanged as, at least for `<filesystem>`, and the `*_chars` use cases, libc++ 7 [should be sufficient](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support/17).\r\n\r\nI've tested that building `<filesystem>` code using Clang 7 & libc++ works. i.e `clang++-7 -std=c++17 fs.cpp -stdlib=libc++ -lc++fs`. Also that building `<filesystem>` code with Clang 7 and libstdc++ 8 works. i.e `clang++-7 -std=c++17  fs.cpp -lstdc++fs`.",
