I was unable to reproduce locally on current master with `(for i in {1..1200}; do test/functional/feature_asmap.py --pdbonfailure ; done)` or `test/functional/feature_asmap.py --valgrind`.  However, asserting on the debug log isn't essential to this regression test. Proposed asserting on the result instead in #23084.",
