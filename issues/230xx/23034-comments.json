No C++ standard to date includes such a function.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it's an *optional* part of C11 which most compilers haven't implemented even; specifically, none of the compilers used for Bitcoin Core's release builds support it.\r\n\r\nLastly, Bitcoin Core has its own (best effort) solution to clearing sensitive memory: an ad-hoc implemented `memory_cleanse` function which uses a technique to avoid being optimized away. We certainly wouldn't want *all* `memset` calls to be replaced with such a security-hardened version; most uses of memory setting are not used for clearing sensitive data.",
