In effect, your transaction chain is bottle necked by any preceding transaction used as an input that is not favored for inclusion in a block. \n\nIn the two examples cited in the above thread, downstream transactions included a fee but were not confirmed in a timely manner because they filed a dependency on an 0 fee ancestor that was ignored by miners until its priority mandated its inclusion. By providing a minconf parameter, you avoid the situation where unconfirmed outputs are spent, and therefore ensure that the addition of a fee is actually meaningful in the context of the current transaction.\n",

Meaning that the software would refuse to make a transaction until some of its unconfirmed change confirmed. It only attempts to use its own unconfirmed change if it was _unable_ to construct a transaction that didn't do so.\n\nSome miners already consider the transactions as a group, fees on the subsequent transactions will pay for their parents. I'd rather see that expanded than change the behavior with change.\n\n(There are reasons unrelated to this why spending unconfirmed anything isn't greatâ the transaction malleability problem, but thats a separate issue)\n",
