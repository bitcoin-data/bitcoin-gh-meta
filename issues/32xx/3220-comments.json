It works for transactions that are either in the mempool or not entirely spent (=in the UTXO set). This may overlap with wallet transactions of course, but is not guaranteed. I think that funtionality doesn't maatch many use cases, and is inefficient. I'd rather have it work under very clear conditions.\n\n@laanwj I'm in favor of both improving the error message and a `getwallettransaction` command (though `gettransaction` is also a wallet RPC, but one that fetches ledger-level information, not transaction-level information).\n",
