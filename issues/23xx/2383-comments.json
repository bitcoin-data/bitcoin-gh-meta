Ultimately wallets will need to deal with that, but they don't currently.\n\nI'd prefer to see a pull request that depriortizes all address reuse, as that will allow reusers with standing relationships to opt into lower priority handling and it encourages blacklisting resistant behavior in our ecosystem.\n",
