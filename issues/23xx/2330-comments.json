Then we can al submit icons, and take a vote on what the community's favourite is.  There may surface something we can all agree to, and maybe even a bounty can be put together (i'll contribute a few bitcents...hey, I'm a poor struggling artist LOL!)...\nWith regards your point about the icon needing to be platform neutral, I agree...and disagree.\nI'll explain. \nA Mac style icon can (and should) be a restyling of one that is drawn to suit a windows app, likewise a linux one; they can all be the same design, but slightly restyled.  For instance, the apple Safari icon; on Mac it is as it should be, but on Windows it _should_ (apple haven't done this, they won't change their icons!) be drawn in a more illustrated style; more pastels, less photoreal etc.  And on Linux, if it were drawn for that platform, it would be perhaps more cartoonish, and vivid, a la the \"Crystal/Krystal\" icon set.\n\nSince the designer has already designed the icon (which is the bulk of the work), and what not, designing a few variants is not a major issue.\nThe icon should be immediately recognisable as Bitcoin, but should look good at high detail (for reference, on Mac, icons now are expected to be 1024x1024...we;re a long way from 32x32, eh?), and should be re-deployable across other platforms in a slightly different style (yet still the same design etc).\nI would suggest we don't veer far from the \"coin\" motif, but again, if we make a forum post about this, and make it a polled \"competition\" or whatever, people are free to do what they like, and the whole community can have a say and input then...obviously this would be an icon only - we're not talking about rebranding Bitcoin itself...just making a better icon for the client app....\n",

I think we should require the same from any replacement icons.\n\nAlthough vector doesn't completely make the scaling issue go away, especially at the very small sizes (such as 16x16/24x24/32x32 for the notification icon) we still need a bitmap.\n\n@schildbach The problem with the launcher icon is separate; to have a high-resolution launcher icon you need to install a .desktop file in the right place, and an icon somewhere in the shared system directories. I'm not sure if the ppa does this, but the problem is not unavailability of the current icon in different sizes.\n",
