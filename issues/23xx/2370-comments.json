After leaving Bitcoin up and connected for several hours, long enough that pending transactions would be retransmitted, does the transaction appear on the unconfirmed list at http://bitcoincharts.com/bitcoin/txlist/\n3. Did the recreated payment use different coin inputs? If so, you probably want to immediately remove the unconfirmed transaction from your wallet using pywallet so the recipient isn't paid twice.\n\nI always wait for some connections before issuing a transaction, as it makes sense to have some relay nodes to send the transaction to. Some testing would be required to see if this can be replicated, and determine if it is related to having no connections and the **tx not being immediately advertised to new connections** (this appears to be the case based on ThePiachu's reply), or is due to issues with the unsynchronized blockchain and uninformed input selection because of this.\n",
