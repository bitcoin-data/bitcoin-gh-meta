I've done a bit of grepping of the source and found the related function, it's BitcoinGUI::setNumBlocks(int count, int nTotalBlocks) on line 500 @ src/qt/bitcoingui.cpp. The problem is that it sets the tooltip just when the block is received and the time is (QDateTime::currentDateTime - lastBlockDate). Obviously, it's the time between block generation and receiving by your node thereby it's pretty useless. I propose calling this function on several events from labelBlocksIcon, progressBarLabel and progressBar. Maybe onMouseMove or onTooltip. I'm not into Qt at all and I don't know which events can be processed and how they're called. I'll try to implement this myself, should be pretty straightforward but I don't promise anything.\n",

This is a qt limitation. I suppose to really fix this the tooltip should be drawn manually.\n\nEdit: issue #2233 was about the same problem\n",

I can understand if people wanted it to say \"3 minutes ago\" instead of showing a time that is 3 minutes earlier than the current time, but I doubt anyone wants the current system which is to show \"3 minutes ago\" and keep it showing \"3 minutes ago\" until the next block is received, which could be days later if I go offline.\n\nI would prefer \"x ago\" instead of a timestamp if the x was true, but \"x ago\" where x is calculated once and never updated is truly useless, and reminds me of an old bug from 1957: http://youtu.be/-tjHlFPTwVk\n",
