However, a decade or so ago (but also a few times since) there were various bugs in the browser origin policy that made it possible to retrieve a file if you had the _exact_ name. This is what led Mozilla, for example, to add a randomized string to the profile directories.\n\nToday's threats are different, with the common attack vector  to exploit bugs in flash, java plugins or the javascript compiler itself. Thus the attacker gains full control over the browser process and playing hide and seek with files won't help you for long.\nSo I think the security gained by this is at most marginal...\n\nAnyway, multi-wallet support is going to allow exactly what you propose.\n",
