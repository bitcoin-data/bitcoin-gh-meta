My entire purpose is to create a new public address for each transaction the same way mt gox appears to do each time I deposit btc into my account.  If the key system is any type of modulus system is it not true that a single private key could have many public solutions?  If that is the case... how to I create a batch new public keys from the \"original\" private key within or outside my wallet?  I would like to create:\n\n1publicaddress12345\n1sumutherpublicaddress12345\n1sumutherpublicaddress12346\n1sumutherpublicaddress12347\n\nI expected these to show up under \"Receive\" so I'm now thinking that I wanted to create new public addresses from the existing key instead of new keys which _seem to be called_ addresses.  Is this right?\n\nMy solution _was_ to use vanitygen + import the newly pressed keys.  But I don't think I want/need all the private keys.  Thoughts? Better place to ask?
