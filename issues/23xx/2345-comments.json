Is there anything in this \"self-regulating system\" to stop someone from hacking the top mining pools and injecting code to take over the network?\n\nThat said, tying things to IP is most certainly a useless effort.  I might suggest alternatively some trust metric.  eg. The more hashing power you contribute (the greater your ability to do damage proportional to the capacity of the network) the less you're trusted in relative terms, sort of a check and balance against majority rule.  Another valuable trust metric might also be to trust individuals who have been generating reliable results the longest over individuals who have just joined the network.  Still not a perfect solution, but might at least avoid the scenarios where a) an entity takes over a few of the leading mining pools, and b) the scenario where someone introduces more 10x improvements in mining ability, c) it may also stop cases like we've recently seen, where a bug was introduced into the newest version of the miner that created a conflicting block-chain.\n",
