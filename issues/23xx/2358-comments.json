      "body" : "No, you are doing everything right. There is a problem with the network at\nthe moment. Basically, the old, 0.7 client that was recently replaced had a\nbug, and it meant that the new 0.8 clients and the old 0.7 clients and\nminers were creating separate chains. This has to be sorted out, and the\nchosen method is for everyone to switch to the chain created by the 0.7\nclients and miners, as all of us can use that one.\nBut this means that, at the moment, transactions that only get included in\none chain could end up being orphaned, and there is a chance that someone\ncould use this confusion to execute a double spend attack.\n\nBasically, what this means is that you should hold off using bitcoin for\nwhile (few hours?), and everything should be fine.\n\nOn 12 March 2013 12:39, lawrence97431 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> First, I acknowledge being technologically illiterate, so I hope I'll be\n> able to adequately explain my problem.
