This was really just an ugly hack, having found mini-node it seems using that would be a much easier and safer way to achieve what I wanted.\n\n@gavinandresen it isn't really a good idea to implement this, but the same can be said for -blocknotify and -walletnotify, if they only create further code to review. \n\n@gmaxwell you're right this would be easier by polling, but i've found using pynode is even easier.\n",
