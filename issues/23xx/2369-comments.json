This is no help for TX processing (if not related to a code bug or the client itself), it's all about problems with our reference client bitcoind and bitcoin-qt!\n\nNo offence here, but the amount of non-code related issues is growing lately, which IMHO is bad, because real bugs are lost in between.\n\nEdit: Perhaps try to restart your client to make new connections at first. Start the client with -debug and take a look in the transaction details, perhaps there is something to observe.\n",
