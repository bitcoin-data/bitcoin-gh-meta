   "body" : "Message types `INV`, `GETDATA`, and `NOTFOUND` are similar in that they all have a payload consisting of a vector of CInv data structure. But while sent INV and GETDATA messages are constructed by aggregating them, and then sending them out in batch during SendMessages, NOTFOUND is sent immediately.\r\n\r\nThis means that separate `GETDATA`s (which do seem sent by some network clients) always result in separate `NOTFOUND`s, a potential waste of outbound bandwidth. Improve upon this by introducing Peer state `m_notfounds_to_send`, aggregating them there during `GETDATA` processing, and sending the result out when it either overflows or during SendMessages.",
