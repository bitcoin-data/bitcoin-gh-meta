Thoughts on this?\r\n\r\nI always assumed that this may also happen when the CNode is spun up. Good to know it only happens on disconnect. However, I don't think this will help us, as the `relaytxes` change was done on purpose, because you don't know when the peer is going to send you their version message and what it contains.
