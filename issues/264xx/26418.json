   "body" : "A user reported on [stackexchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/q/115742/48884) that they were unable to sign for a `multi_a` script using a wallet that only had the corresponding keys (i.e. it did not have the `multi_a()` descriptor). This PR fixes this issue.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `wallet_taproot.py` is modified to test for this scenario by having another wallet in `do_test_psbt` which contains descriptors that only have the keys involved in the descriptor being tested. `wallet_taproot.py` was also modified to create new wallets for each test case rather than sharing wallets throughout as the sharing could result in the signing wallet having the keys in a different descriptor and accidentally result in failing to detect a test failure.\r\n\r\nThe changes to the test also revealed a similar issue with `rawtr()` descriptors, which has also been fixed by checking if a descriptor can produce a `SigningProvider` for the Taproot output pubkey.",
