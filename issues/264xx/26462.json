   "body" : "Loading a descriptor wallet currently leads to a segfault if a legacy key type entry is present that can be deserialized successfully and needs SPKman-interaction. To reproduce with a \"cscript\" entry (see second commit for details):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli createwallet crashme\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli unloadwallet crashme\r\n$ sqlite3 ~/.bitcoin/wallets/crashme/wallet.dat\r\nSQLite version 3.38.2 2022-03-26 13:51:10\r\nEnter \".help\" for usage hints.\r\nsqlite> INSERT INTO main VALUES(x'07637363726970740000000000000000000000000000000000000000', x'00');\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli loadwallet crashme\r\n\r\n--- bitcoind output: ---\r\n2022-11-06T13:51:01Z Using SQLite Version 3.38.2\r\n2022-11-06T13:51:01Z Using wallet /home/honey/.bitcoin/wallets/crashme\r\n2022-11-06T13:51:01Z init message: Loading walletâ¦\r\n2022-11-06T13:51:01Z [crashme] Wallet file version = 10500, last client version = 249900\r\n\r\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBackground: In the wallet key-value-loading routine, most legacy type entries require a `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` instance after successful deserialization. On a descriptor wallet, creating that (via method `GetOrCreateLegacyScriptPubKeyMan`) fails and then leads to a null-pointer dereference crash. E.g. for CSCRIPT: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/50422b770a40f5fa964201d1e99fd6b5dc1653ca/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L589-L594\r\n\r\n\r\n~~This PR fixes this by simply ignoring legacy entries if the wallet flags indicate that we have a descriptor wallet. The second commits adds a regression test to the descriptor wallet's functional test (fortunately Python includes sqlite3 support in the standard library).~~\r\n\r\n~~Probably it would be even better to throw a warning to the user if unexpected legacy entries are found in descriptor wallets, but I think as a first mitigation everything is obvisouly better than crashing. As far as I'm aware, descriptor wallets created/migrated by Bitcoin Core should never end up in a state containing legacy type entries though.~~\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by throwing an error if legacy entries are found in descriptor wallets on loading.",
