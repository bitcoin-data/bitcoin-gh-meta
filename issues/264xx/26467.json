   "body" : "When bumping the transaction fee, we will try to find the change output of the transaction in order to have an output whose value we can modify so that we can meet the target feerate. However we do not always find the change output which can cause us to unnecessarily add an additional output to the transaction. We can avoid this issue by outsourcing the determination of change to the user if they so desire.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `orig_change_pos` option to bumpfee which the user can use to specify the index of the change output. Additionally, a new dialog is added to the GUI that allows the user to select the change output when they are bumping the transaction fee. This dialog will default select output that the wallet determines to be change, if it could find one.\r\n\r\nFixes #11233\r\nFixes #20795",
