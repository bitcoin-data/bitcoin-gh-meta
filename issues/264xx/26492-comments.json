      "body" : "> I am happy to test on OpenBSD, but someone will have to provide exact steps to reproduce from scratch (I have only Linux)\r\n\r\nFWIW, my current approach for reproducing this issue is using qemu 6.2.0 on a (Debian) Linux host to install/run OpenBSD 7.2 on an emulated SPARC64 [1] guest machine. It's currently building Bitcoin Core v24.0rc4 inside, but it is extremely slow and probably still takes some more hours, so I can't say for sure yet whether the build will be even successful and if yes, if the problem can be reproduced. Anyways, here are the (rough) instructions recreated from my shell history, happy to help if there are any questions:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ wget https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/7.2/sparc64/install72.iso\r\n$ qemu-img create disk.img 20G\r\n$ qemu-system-sparc64 -nographic -drive file=./disk.img,format=raw -cdrom ./install72.iso -boot d -m 4096\r\n\r\n(Follow the installation instructions, use proposed defaults whenever possible, then halt the machine)\r\n\r\n$ qemu-system-sparc64 -nographic -drive file=./disk.img,format=raw -boot c -m 4096\r\n\r\n(When prompted for \"root device:\", enter \"wd0\", and confirm default \"swap device\")\r\n(Login as \"root\")\r\n\r\n$ cp /etc/examples/doas.conf /etc/doas.conf\r\n$ logout\r\n\r\n(Login as user, as created during installation)\r\n\r\n$ mkdir packages\r\n$ export PKG_CACHE=/home/username/packages\r\n$ doas pkg_add git\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\r\n$ cd bitcoin/\r\n$ git checkout <desired_version>\r\n\r\n(Follw build instructions in doc/build-openbsd.md, configure with CC=clang and CXX=clang++)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[1] Note that installing OpenBSD for ppc64 (via qemu-system-ppc64) failed, as the cdrom drive couldn't be mounted. If anyone figured out how to do this, would be happy to get instructions. I chose SPARC64 as substitute in the somewhat naive hope that it's another big-endian 64-bit system that could be close enough to trigger the reported issue in OpenBSD.",
