We need to come to a consensus on whether we will release 24.0 with the option, and once it's out the door, we can go back to arguing about whether to have it in the long term.",

      "body" : "Concept ACK for two main reasons:\r\n\r\n1. As a matter of general policy, I believe it is better to release on time (or slightly late) without a new feature than to either delay the release for the new feature or release a new feature that has outstanding concerns by a significant number of well-informed good actors.\r\n\r\n2. As I argued extensively on [#26287][], I believe we should provide one release cycle worth of advanced warning in the release notes when we are contemplating a change that may significantly adversely affect downstream users.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI was trying to think of previous occasions where the project removed code during the RC process due to controversy, so here's a quick summary with references of what I think is the closest match to our current circumstances.\r\n\r\n*A brief history of making the BIP61 P2P `reject` message an option, disabling it by default, and then removing it across the 0.17, 0.18, 0.19, and 0.20 releases:*\r\n\r\n- 2018-05-01: [#13134][] opened to add an `enablebip61` configuration option and default it to true (the existing behavior).  Merged 22 days later.  Released in 0.17 five months later.\r\n\r\n- 2018-08-24: [#14054][] opened to default `enablebip61` to false (a change in default behavior).  Merged 27 days later.\r\n\r\n- 2019-03-01: version 0.18 with branched off master (per [#14438][])\r\n\r\n- 2019-03-06: an [announcement](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-March/016701.html) of the planned disablement was posted to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list.  Several people protest the change.\r\n\r\n- 2019-03-14: [#15602][] opened directly against the 0.18 branch to revert `enablebip61` back to true but adding a release note saying, \"BIP 61 reject messages are now deprecated.  [...] BIP 61 messages will be disabled by default in a future version, before being removed entirely.\"  Merged the same day and released in 0.18 six weeks later.\r\n\r\n- 2019-11-24: version 0.19 released with `enablebip61=0`\r\n\r\n- 2019-10-18 (date out of order): [#15347][] merged into master (after 0.19 was branched off) to fully remove BIP61 `reject` message support, including the `enablebip61` option.\r\n\r\nIn comparing that situation to the current one, I imagine those in favor of `mempoolfullrbf` will note that `enablebip61` was included in 0.17 without issue.  It's not clear to me whether that was because its preservation of existing behavior was unopposed or because nobody who would've opposed it knew about the change before its release.\r\n\r\nWhat I appreciate about the previous situation is that the project at that time met the surprise of downstream users to a non-emergency change in an RC with a quick reversion but a clear statement of future intent---an intent which was ultimately realized.  The total delay this added to the plan of removing BIP61 was just six months.\r\n\r\nWe're not currently in a position where I think any of us can predict the future state of full-rbf within Bitcoin Core, but I think we can take this opportunity to release 24.0 quickly without a controversial change and with communication to downstream users that there may be rbf-related changes in the next major release (and that the consequences of those potential changes may manifest even earlier due to activity outside of the Bitcoin Core project).\r\n\r\n[#26287]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26287\r\n[#13134]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13134\r\n[#14054]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14054\r\n[#14438]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14438\r\n[#15602]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15602\r\n[#15347]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15347",

(e.g. I consider Suhas a well informed good actor with an unfortunately very last minute intervention but I also consider Peter, Luke, Andrew as well informed good actors who are all in favor of releasing 24.0 with this option) There are a small minority commenting who will be against enabling this option or any additional RBF mempool policy support (e.g. in v3 transaction relay) in any future version: 25.0, 26.0, 27.0 etc. So a valid concern a significant number of commenters have is that either it is never released because of this small minority or worse some strange compromise is proposed with that small minority (and I've observed this tendency with you a number of times now) which ends up being inferior to the initial simpler solution.",

Acceptance of it is minimal for the obvious reason that people relying on it get scammed. Frankly, pulling this feature just sends the message that zeroconf *is* safe enough to rely on it. That's exactly the message that people like @bitcoinerrorlog are trying to promote right now.\r\n\r\nNow, let's get to scheduling: if you pull this option, I fully expect @bitcoinerrorlog to rush his product to the market and in 6 months on the next release, complain that we have to delay everything yet again for his sake.

My point is not to weigh the quantity or quality of one side against another but merely to recognize that there are \"outstanding concerns\" and to state my belief that \"it is better to release on time (or slightly late) without a new feature than to either delay the release for the new feature or release a new feature that has outstanding concerns\".\r\n\r\n> Are you saying that we should be so concerned about [...] a default off option that could potentially affect the three companies\r\n\r\nYes!  We should be concerned about the things our downstream users find concerning.  I know that argument cuts both ways on this issue---as those responding to your advocacy have shown, there are users concerned about not having this option.  But not having an option is the exact same behavior we had in the prior release; it's non-inclusion will be a surprise only to those who knew it was included in master and the RCs, and (ironically) the point of having a development branch and RCs is to allow immature code to be replaced---we offer no guarantees of feature finality on master or RCs.  We do have policies and precedents for announcing changes in releases that may adversely affect some users, such as in the case of a deprecation, and I'm stating in my concept ACK that I feel it's more important to follow those policies than it is to release a new feature.\r\n\r\n> pulling this feature just sends the message that zeroconf is safe enough to rely on it.\r\n\r\nI think a warning that future releases may include a `mempoolfullrbf` option, along with a reminder that zeroconf is unsafe, sends a clear message that nobody should be relying on it.  For #26287, I wrote a [proposed release note](https://gist.github.com/harding/f3cd8affb10cea96d352347fed7f4a3a) doing just that; I'm happy to update it to the current circumstances.\r\n\r\n> if you pull this option, I fully expect [people in the future to] complain that we have to delay everything yet again for [their] sake. This ridiculous process can and will go on forever.\r\n\r\nAlthough I find the present debate frustrating at times, I'm amazed at the quantity and quality of information produced by advocates on all sides in just the past few weeks.  I wouldn't have thought a default-to-previous-behavior option would warrant concern, or realized how high a percentage of nodes needed the same policy to ensure reliable propagation, or seen the downsides of preferential peering, or contemplated non-replacement as a DoS-resistant policy useful in many cases, or discovered that full-rbf doesn't make any existing coinjoin or contracting protocol more reliable when opt-in rbf is available, or considered the perspective of RBF wallets authors who allow importing stuck transactions from other wallets, or been exposed to several other interesting and important technical arguments.\r\n\r\nI guess if your end goal is to enable full-rbf or kill zeroconf, or conversely to limit rbf or preserve zeroconf, what has happened in the last month looks like a ridiculous zig-zag of a process, but to me it looks like exactly the process we want---technical experts investigating all of the nuances of a subject so that developers (and ultimately users) can make fully informed choices.  If new and important arguments are still being formulated in six months by the 25.0 release, then maybe we should delay again---but if all of the arguments at that time are well-known among experts, I have confidence in the contributors to this project that they'll make the best choice available at that time.",

      "body" : "@harding \r\n> > exactly [who do] you think are the good actors here\r\n> \r\n> I think there are a significant number of well-informed good actors on all sides of this debate. My point is not to weigh the quantity or quality of one side against another but merely to recognize that there are \"outstanding concerns\" and to state my belief that \"it is better to release on time (or slightly late) without a new feature than to either delay the release for the new feature or release a new feature that has outstanding concerns\".\r\n\r\nThere will always be outstanding concerns. On the dev mailing list, we even had Bitrefill essentially make the argument that opt-in-rbf should be removed, and @bitcoinerrorlog has fairly explicitly made that argument.\r\n\r\nSo that leaves us with weighing competing concerns. Who do you think are the \"good actors\" exactly? When we're blocking the release of a default-off option that is widely desired in the community - an action that obviously prevents the community by just voicing their support by simply running with the option enabled - we should have some transparency on who calls the shots.\r\n\r\n> > Are you saying that we should be so concerned about [...] a default off option that could potentially affect the three companies\r\n> \r\n> Yes! We should be concerned about the things our downstream users find concerning. I know that argument cuts both ways on this issue---as those responding to your advocacy have shown, there are users concerned about not having this option. But not having an option is the exact same behavior we had in the prior release; it's non-inclusion will be a surprise only to those who knew it was included in master and the RCs, and (ironically) the point of having a development branch and RCs is to allow immature code to be replaced---we offer no guarantees of feature finality on master or RCs. We do have policies and precedents for announcing changes in releases that may adversely affect some users, such as in the case of a deprecation, and I'm stating in my concept ACK that I feel it's more important to follow those policies than it is to release a new feature.\r\n\r\nThe fact is for multiple months it was considered likely that RBF in *some* form would be shipped in v24.0. That wasn't controversial except of course to the tiny group who believe so strongly in zeroconf that they even argue replacement in general should be removed.\r\n\r\nI will say it explicitly: the opinions of that group should not count in this decision. From a technology point of view they're nuts.\r\n\r\nThat leaves us with a reasonable political compromise: let the community decide. Which was why I and many others were fine with a default-off.\r\n\r\nNow at the last minute we're pulling that feature... for what reason exactly? Other than \"controversy\" I haven't seen any coherent argument as to why a *default off* option should not be released.\r\n\r\n> > pulling this feature just sends the message that zeroconf is safe enough to rely on it.\r\n> \r\n> I think a warning that future releases may include a `mempoolfullrbf` option, along with a reminder that zeroconf is unsafe, sends a clear message that nobody should be relying on it. For #26287, I wrote a [proposed release note](https://gist.github.com/harding/f3cd8affb10cea96d352347fed7f4a3a) doing just that; I'm happy to update it to the current circumstances.\r\n\r\nQuoting https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26438#issuecomment-1304981580\r\n\r\n> yes. I disagree with him. zeroconf is not safe nor unsafe. its just\r\nzeroconf. how is it unsafe? because it can fall out of mempool? so can a\r\n1conf.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that at least some people are of the mistaken impression that zeroconf is safer than it is. Pulling the default-off `mempoolfullrbf` option is telling those people that you were keeping zeroconf safe. No amount of \"clear messages\" in release notes that few people read is going to stop that message.\r\n\r\n> > if you pull this option, I fully expect [people in the future to] complain that we have to delay everything yet again for [their] sake. This ridiculous process can and will go on forever.\r\n> \r\n> Although I find the present debate frustrating at times, I'm amazed at the quantity and quality of information produced by advocates on all sides in just the past few weeks.\r\n\r\nI'm not.\r\n\r\n> I wouldn't have thought a default-to-previous-behavior option would warrant concern\r\n\r\nYes, no sane person would have thought that... and sure enough, the Core dev members who are advocating otherwise haven't given us clear explanations of why they're blocking this option. What I do see is the possibility that their work on v3 transactions is influencing the decision, because v3 transactions aren't clearly secure. Obviously, if that's the case that gives us even *more* reason to release this option to learn more about the incentives involved.\r\n\r\n> I guess if your end goal is to enable full-rbf or kill zeroconf, or conversely to limit rbf or preserve zeroconf, what has happened in the last month looks like a ridiculous zig-zag of a process, but to me it looks like exactly the process we want---technical experts investigating all of the nuances of a subject so that developers (and ultimately users) can make fully informed choices. If new and important arguments are still being formulated in six months by the 25.0 release, then maybe we should delay again---but if all of the arguments at that time are well-known among experts, I have confidence in the contributors to this project that they'll make the best choice available at that time.\r\n\r\nI have far less confidence now than I did a month ago. No-one has been able to articulate a clear reason why they're trying to block this default-off option. You can point to \"concerns\" and \"debate\" all you want. But the fact is, we have Core devs trying to block people from using an option with clear use-cases, and a wider political significance.\r\n\r\nWhat it does smell like is that the v3 transaction proposal is kinda broken, and @sdaftuar thinks that by blocking full-rbf, the brokenness of them will be less obvious and they won't have wasted as much work. Not only is that technical nonsense - it's fine if only a subset of miners choose to follow the v3 rules, as it'll still achieve the goal of pinning protection - it's also an abuse of the political side of decision making.\r\n\r\nStop trying to block full-rbf. Let the community decide.",

The discrimination against opt-in-rbf transactions is very annoying to both users and wallet authors. The opt-in flag also harms privacy for everyone. There's a clear political debate at hand here, and people have genuine reasons to support the side against zeroconf by running full-rbf.\n",

The most obvious one being min relay fees (and the close cousin, the max mempool size limit). It is precisely that divergence that allowed myself and others to over and over again make successful double-spends with rbf.

There is nothing to sybil attack.\r\n\r\nEqually from a different perspective, if someone wants to make a large number of nodes relay full-rbf, removing a default-off configuration option changes absolutely nothing: turning full-rbf on is literally a one-line patch. Anyone technologically sophisticated enough to be doing a genuine sybil attack will have the ability to turn that feature on themselves.\r\n\r\n>     * it's opaque and hard to quantify where the current count is at\r\n\r\nAccording to some commenters that's a good thing, as they believe that full-rbf nodes will get attacked.\r\n\r\nAnyway, ease of double-spending is the obvious and natural way of measuring support. Indeed, there is no need to \"measure\" support directly.\r\n\r\n>     * nodes voting for or against full-RBF may transition the network to an intermediate state without enough adoption to reach the percolation threshold, which isn't what either party is voting for:\r\n\r\nAs you yourself admit, if an intermediate state is somehow a problem, fixing that by running a few more full-rbf nodes is easily accomplished.\r\n\r\n>       * Some full-RBF-enabled nodes can sometimes use full-RBF, while others can't.\r\n\r\nFull-RBF nodes that definitely need it to work can easily connect to a node with preferential peering.

I think your misunderstandings are illustrative of why it would be a serious mistake to remove this default-off option: we'd be sending a message that zeroconf is safe and we had made a meaningful difference in making it safer.\r\n\r\nAlso, I do not believe that creating conditions where Muun wallet feels it must switch to its previous behavior of waiting for a confirmation is a showstopper: users can easily migrate to a different wallet like Phoenix that actually implements the Lightning protocol in the wallet, as expected.",

      "body" : "Fwiw, despite all the attention and attribution Peter is making to me, I was not the originator of this fresh debate. Muun brought it to my attention, along with Bitrefill and colleagues. \n\nI have been part of merchant efforts to explore and formalize best practices for 0conf use cases for 4 years, from \"turbo channels\" thru to our new wallet, Bitkit. Before I worked at Bitrefill I was ignorant and did not see how users benefit from 0conf, nor did I understand the various ways a merchant can limit their exposure to 0conf risks. The risks 0conf-accepting merchants accept are known and manageable and a very useful service to Bitcoiners, generating txns, fees, utility, etc.\n\nFurther, 0conf risk-mitigations make Lightning complexity bearable for users at the app level, when buying channels, and LN implementations have all recently added support, finally, for 0conf channels. I anticipate this will help greatly with adoption and UX of wallets.\n\nThis is all thanks to first-seen policy in mempools. This policy has \"somehow\" helped us discover that such behaviors may be incentive-compatible. Even if this changes, we do not know how many days or decades it may take, and opt-in rbf is fine as-was for 7 years as well. \n\nHowever temporary you may believe this harmony to be, it is no reason to disrupt it. None of us can actually predict the future nor claim to have a perfect grasp of incentives across all interactions. What we do know is this is working and Bitcoiners are benefiting.\n\nWe also know that full-rbf can be implemented at the wallet level easily. We even have designs for doing so in our app if we can extend bip21 to pass incidental feerate and rbf-off flags as a standard for merchant invoicing. These are quite elegant and achievable goals.\n\nI am not sure how Peter thinks our product roadmapping works, or what product he thinks we will \"rush\" out in 6 months, or why any of that would be a threat to anyone or anything, but such claims are irrelevant and inaccurate. What I want is to build on the Bitcoin we have without it shifting under my feet at the whim of self-righteous equivocators with pet designs for Bitcoin Core. \n\nI am advocating to protect what we have and to avoid influencing delicate policy decisions. Rbf and 0conf can coexist under first-seen and I find the full-rbf plan to be unfair as it opts txns into behaviors without their choice. I understand that this could still happen without Core assistance, but that fact is that in 7 years it has not, and we have had no issues with rbf or with 0conf.\n\nThanks for your consideration and sorry for yet more text for you to read on this topic. I am here to protect Bitcoin and ensure maximal usage in any appropriate way I can.",
