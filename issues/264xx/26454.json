There is no consensus over the mempool, and especially in times of congestion, a higher fee transaction may be able to replace a lower fee one regardless of fee rate.\r\n\r\nNo changes to the tests were required, as this case is not tested. If `-mempoolfullrbf` (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25353) is enabled, the replacement is of course added to the mempool. If not, the replacement is added to the wallet and may be broadcast later.\r\n\r\nQuestion: What would be the best way to force the transaction to be added to the mempool, with broadcast?",
