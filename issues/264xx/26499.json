   "body" : "When a block is reorged out of the main chain, any descendants of the coinbase will no longer be valid. Currently they are only marked as inactive, which means that our balance calculations will still include them. In order to be excluded from the balance calculation, they need to either be abandoned or conflicted. This PR goes with the abandoned method.\r\n\r\nNote that even when they are included in balance calculations, coin selection will not select outputs belonging to these transactions because they are not in the mempool.\r\n\r\nFixes #14148",
