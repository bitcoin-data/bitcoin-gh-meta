   "body" : "Reverts #25353 for 24.x only. Alternative to #26438 and #26287.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not a backport. This is not intended to be merged into master, nor is it a followup to #26438. This is a standalone PR for 24.x only.\r\n\r\nIt's clear that the discussion around the mempoolfullrbf option is holding up the 24.0 release. Release candidates have been taking longer than usual with the hope that a resolution will be found before the next RC. But it seems that we are deadlocked on this issue. I believe that the release maintainer is hesitant to tag the release while this discussion is ongoing.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of getting the 24.0 release out sooner, I am opening this PR to remove the mempoolfullrbf option from **24.0 only**. The option will remain in master so that we can continue to discuss it. This maintains the current status quo - the option is new, and similar options have not been in releases for several years.\r\n\r\nWhile our general policy is that only backports of bug fixes are merged into release branches after feature freeze, I think it is reasonable to make an exception considering the magnitude of the disagreement mempoolfullrbf is causing. Maintaining the status quo allows the discussion to resolve in its own timeframe without holding up the release.",
