Due to the `DEFAULT_MAX_TIP_AGE` check this should only be able to happen if the tip is less than 24h old.\r\n\r\n@sander2 If you are going to be turning the node on and off for <24h and need this check then perhaps you want to consider a different approach, such as comparing your tip/height to the tip served by some public block explorers' APIs?",
