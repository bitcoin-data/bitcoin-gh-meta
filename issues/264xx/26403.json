Implementation of idea written out at https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021036.html\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n- [x] Disallow multiple ephemeral anchors(no use case for multiple since CPFP miner code would ignore other bumps, and allows for SIGHASH_SINGLE output inflation\r\n- [ ]  Fix same-parent-different-child case, make sure ephemeral outputs are still spent or reject RBF\r\n- [ ]  Way better test coverage\r\n- [ ] Decide if this logic should be gated for only V3 transactions\r\n- [ ] Decide if ephemeral anchors should only be spent by the single child in a package, vs checking if they were spent anywhere in the sorted package",
