Not sure what a good approach is -- maybe something like \"mine proposed non-standard txs in a secret closed network that includes btcd, rust-bitcoin, etc; if any of those nodes lose sync or crash, raise it as a security issue with those devs; only mine the proposed tx on signet proper if nothing crashes\" ?
