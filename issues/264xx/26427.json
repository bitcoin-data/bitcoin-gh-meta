You need to do some compiler magic (such as perhaps call `std::launder`? Or actually some weird placement-new that does nothing?) here to properly start the lifetime of the `T` array object, as far as the C++ abstract machine is concerned.  See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbkQG09grFw\r\n  -  C++20 does *now* allows this -- implicit lifetimes can be started when you use some backing store in this way for trivial types only, but in C++17 this is technically UB.\r\n  - The fact that this works is a happy accident because most major compiler support such (mis)-use of the language for trivial types owing to its C roots. So much so that they actually changed the standard for C++20 to support this, but for '17 this is UB (but works in practice on all major compilers).  \r\n- The following is not fixed in C++20 though: Memory is not guaranteed to be aligned to whatever T requires here. (This is not fixed by C++20 -- unaligned access is UB, even if it happens to work on your platform). So `prevector` only really works without UB for `uint8_t` and similar types, if on C++20.\r\n",
