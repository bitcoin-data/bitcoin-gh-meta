I don't want the unsigned transactions that I give to the wallet changing every time I run because that could hide bugs in the wallet code.\r\n\r\n@achow101 based on your comment, I went to implement explicit coin selection, only to realize I was already doing so.\r\n\r\nI'd misdiagnosed the issue: it wasn't coin selection that was unstable, but the order of UTXOs output by `listunspent`.\r\n\r\nI fixed that by sorting the unspents before choosing amongst them.
