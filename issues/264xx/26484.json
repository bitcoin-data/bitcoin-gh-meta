So I'm using the argument\r\n\r\n```\r\n-bind=bitcoind:${BITCOIND_TOR_PORT}=onion\r\n```\r\n\r\n`/etc/hostname` is set to `bitcoind` and the `hostname` command yields the expected result. Also, both `nslookup` and `ping` can resolve the hostname to the external IP.\r\n\r\nNote: I cannot use the numerical IP, because Docker assigns IP addresses dynamically on each invocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI'd expect bitcoind to also resolve the hostname to my external IP, just like ping and nslookup do.\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\nIn short, it dies.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoind_1          | Error: Cannot resolve -bind address: 'bitcoind:8334=onion'\r\nbitcoind_1          | Shutdown: In progress...\r\nbitcoind_1          | Error: Cannot resolve -bind address: 'bitcoind:8334=onion'\r\nbitcoind_1          | Shutdown: done\r\n```\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\nbitcoind 24.0rc4 (self built), Docker+Compose from Ubuntu 22.04.1.\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue? What is your operating system and its version? If Linux, what is your desktop environment and graphical shell? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n",
