   "body" : "If a test framework message's field name is in the list of `HASH_INT_VECTORS`, we currently assume that it _always_ has to contain a vector of integers and throw otherwise:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0ebd4db32b39cb7c505148f090df4b7ac778c307/contrib/message-capture/message-capture-parser.py#L82-L83\r\n(introduced in PR #25367, commit 42bbbba7c83d1e2baad18b4c6f05bad1358eb117).\r\n\r\nHowever, that assumption is too strict. The (de)serialization field name \"headers\" is used in two different message types, one for `cfcheckpt` (where it is serialized as an integer vector), and another time for `headers` (where it is serialized as a vector of `CBlockHeader`s). Parsing the latter fails as it is not an integer vector and thus triggers the assert.\r\n\r\nFix this by adding the integer type check as additional condition to the `HASH_INT_VECTORS` check rather than asserting.\r\nFixes #25954.",
