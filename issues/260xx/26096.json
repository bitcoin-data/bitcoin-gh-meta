   "body" : "**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\n`listtransactions \"*\" 100` in a wallet with 35 transactions should list all 35 transactions in the wallet.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\n`listtransactions \"*\" 100` lists 14 transactions, but does not list 21 transactions that are self-sends.\r\n\r\nNote that `getwalletinfo` returns:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"txcount\": 35,\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the wallet does seem to know about the self-send transactions. (The \"missing\" transactions also show up in the GUI)\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nI have only seen the problem with one particular wallet. The only other wallet I have tested with is running on an older Bitcoin Core v0.20.1 (actually Omni Core) version and does seem to correctly list self-sends.\r\n\r\nThe wallet showing the problem is an imported HD `tpub` descriptor wallet that was created with **bitcoinj** and then the descriptors were imported via `importdescriptors`. I noticed that there is a Python functional test for `listtransactions` that checks self-sends, so perhaps the problem is related to it being a watch-only descriptor wallet with imported descriptors. It may also be relevant that the self-sends had two-outputs, both a \"destination\" and a change address.\r\n\r\nI can reliably reproduce the problem with the wallet that is showing the problem.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\nMacBook Pro M1\r\nmacOS Monterey 12.5.1\r\n\r\n**Bitcoin Core v23.0.0** pre-built \"official\" binary.\r\n\r\nI am willing to provide additional information and/or run additional tests to help track this down.\r\n\r\n",
