This concern didn't exist with legacy wallets as they were always hardened, but descriptor wallets are by default non-hardened. If your keys are derived in a non-hardened way, all keys should be considered to really be representations of the same secret material, and exporting one is the same as exporting all. And when exporting the private descriptor (which includes the xprv), it's obvious you are exporting everything.\r\n* It's just the wrong direction to move in, as descriptor wallets aren't key-centric anymore (multisig descriptors are first class wallets, and can't support this cleanly).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about alternatively providing an RPC or a tool that can derive and return the private keys involved in a descriptor?",
