   "body" : "Wallets that have a ton of non-ranged descriptors (such as a migrated non-HD wallet) perform fairly poorly due to looping through all of the wallet's `ScriptPubKeyMan`s. This is done in various places, such as `IsMine`, signing, and helper functions for fetching a `ScriptPubKeyMan` and a `SolvingProvider`.\r\n\r\nAs these functions are based on doing `IsMine` for each `ScriptPubKeyMan`, we can improve this performance by doing some caching `IsMine` scriptPubKeys for non-ranged descriptors and use that to determine which `ScriptPubKeyMan` to actually use for those things. The scriptPubKeys for ranged descriptors will not be cached. To avoid iterating the cached spkms for things that belong to the ranged descriptors, a cache of those uncached spkms is also added so that the uncached spkms can be iterated after the scriptPubKey cache is searched.\r\n\r\nAlso added a benchmark for `IsMine`.",
