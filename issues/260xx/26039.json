Without compile-time enforcement this will lead to places where it is forgotten and thus to inconsistencies and bugs. Fix this by removing the calls to `RPCTypeCheck` and doing the check internally.\r\n\r\nThe changes should be reviewed as refactoring changes. However, if they change behavior, it will be a bugfix. For example the changes here happen to also detect/fix bugs like the one fixed in commit 3b5fb6e77a93f58b3d03b1eec3595f5c45e633a9.",
