   "body" : "Syncing blockchain is sometimes very slow. I think this has become more common in the past months.\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot from Network Traffic window in the GUI, see how there are long periods of absolutely no traffic. Also see how it only downloaded about 100 MB during the first 30minutes of syncing. It's also often connected to just 1 or 2 peers which is weird.\r\n\r\n![bitcointrafficverylowandslow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79941375/189544394-3cb3dd32-b384-437e-a785-456b149b0258.png)\r\n\r\nInternet is stable and I can easily download 10 MB/second.\r\nCPU load stays mostly low so lack of CPU resources doesn't explain this.\r\nMemory usage is also not high. I have set the memory option in the settings menu to 4 GB.\r\n\r\nSometimes it starts to work faster if you close and restart the program. But as I said this has become worse in the past months. \r\n\r\nWhy doesn't it download blocks faster than this? If the problem is that peers can't provide blocks faster, why isn't it looking for more peers?\r\n\r\nI'm using the latest master from git as of today.",
