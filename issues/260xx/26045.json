   "body" : "This is an attempt to implement #25675.\r\n\r\nI was able to reduce the serialized utxo set from 5GB to 4.4GB on mainnet.\r\nIt took 5m20s on master and 6m22s on this PR to run `dumptxoutset`.\r\n\r\nThe main downside of this implementation is that the entire UTXO set must be loaded in RAM (in `mapCoins`) before being written to disk. So running `dumptxoutset` will consome a lot of RAM on mainnet since the utxo set is large. \r\nNot sure how to improve this.\r\nIf this cannot be improved, I don't think it's worth the change but I thought i'd give it a go anyway.\r\n\r\nCloses #25675.",
