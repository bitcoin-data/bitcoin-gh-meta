   "body" : "When producing a dummy signature for the purpose of estimating the transaction fee, do not assume an external signer performs R-value grinding on the signature.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this avoids a scenario where the fee rate is 1 sat / vbyte and a transaction with a 72 byte signature is not accepted into our mempool.\r\n\r\nSuggested testing:\r\n1. On master, launch with `-signet` and create an external signer wallet using e.g. a Trezor and HWI, see [guide](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/external-signer.md#example-usage) (with the GUI it should \"just work\" once you have the HWI path configured).\r\n2. Create a few addresses and fund them from the faucet: https://signet.bc-2.jp/ (wait for confirmation)\r\n3. Create another address, and now send the entire wallet to it, set the fee to 1 sat/byte\r\n4. Most likely this transaction never gets broadcast and you won't see it on the [signet explorer](https://explorer.bc-2.jp) \r\n\r\n5. With this PR, try again.\r\n6. Check the explorer and inspect the transaction. Each input witness starts with either `30440220` (R has 32 bytes) or `30440221` (R has 33 bytes). See this explainer for [DER encoding](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/92680/what-are-the-der-signature-and-sec-format).\r\n\r\nFixes #26030 ",
