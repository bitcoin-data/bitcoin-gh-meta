   "body" : "**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core, ideally, should always have peers to try to connect to just like when started for the very first time (empty `peers.dat`). It should not be more difficult to find possible peers if it was ran before with a different `-onlynet=` setting.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\nIf addrman has some entries, even to only unreachable networks, due to previous runs and changes in `-onlynet`, then the fixed seeds will not be used.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nRun with `-onlynet=ipv4`, change to `-onlynet=i2p`.\r\n\r\n**To fix**\r\n\r\nThis problem is two-fold:\r\n\r\n1. Fixed seeds should be used if we have 0 reachable peers in addrman. I guess this condition should be relaxed, like discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25678#issuecomment-1238542029\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fc44d1796e4df5824423d7d13de3082fe204db7d/src/net.cpp#L1628\r\n\r\n2. Even if there are a few reachable peers in addrman, e.g. 0.1% it will take a long time before they are tried. The address selection logic can be improved. It is, simplified, like this (see lines [1797](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fc44d1796e4df5824423d7d13de3082fe204db7d/src/net.cpp#L1797) and [1810](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fc44d1796e4df5824423d7d13de3082fe204db7d/src/net.cpp#L1810)):\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect random address\r\nif not reachable then try another random address\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan be improved to \"select random address, but only from reachable networks\".\r\n\r\nThis problem is amplified by the fact that we do not save non-reachable addresses in addrman during p2p gossip (and also see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25678). Maybe we should reconsider that as a 3rd fixup, in addition to the above 2 - save even unreachable addresses in addrman during p2p gossip and fixed seeds loadup? What is the worst that can happen? We will have some wasted space in addrman if `onlynet` is never altered?",
