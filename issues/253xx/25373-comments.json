It sounds to me a minor point as the more substantial efforts are to document correctly the full-rbf behavior, the interactions with existing softwares (not only standard wallet but also second-layers) and communicate them well towards the community and node operators.\r\n\r\nThough if I should make a comment on the naming itself, `mempoolreplacement` is confusing to me as firstly there is no `false` option. Secondly referring to the `fee` partial argument is redundant as it's already implied by RBF and thirdly the `optin` versus `-optin` is more likely to bewilder the operators and lead them to misconfigure their nodes.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, after this PR, they do have to take _action_ by setting `-mempoolreplacement=\"fee,optin\"` to keep the previous node behavior running, in contrary to #25353 where only the interested users have to do something.",

Because when `-mempoolreplacement` is `true` it implies RBF opt-out is enforced (a replacement policy). However when `-mempoolreplacement` is `false` it implies full-RBF (also a replacement policy). I think the patch is confusing by not using the constant `DEFAULT_REPLACEMENT_HONOUR_OPTOUT` here : https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25373/files#diff-b1e19192258d83199d8adaa5ac31f067af98f63554bfdd679bd8e8073815e69dR1045...\r\n\r\nAnyway, I reiterate I don't care which patch gets in and I'll let other reviewers express which approach they prefer. I won't comment further. If it's just a config naming issue after all, it's not worth my energy to argue on :shrug:",

To give wider publicity for the conversation rather than lost in GH, I'll follow-up there.\r\n\r\nI fully understand the uncertainty and optionality for 0-conf merchants of the existence of a full-rbf topology on the p2p network. However, the rational behind my proposal isn't motivated by making full-RBF a cultural norm or whatever but to solve a really tangible and naive DoS issue affecting the funding flow of p2p coinjoin, on-chain DLCs, dual-funded channels, etc. I think it's always interesting as a community to have a conversation on how we should approach the design and deployment of policy in case of conflicting use-cases (i,e \"X is made worst by making better Y\").\r\n\r\nNote, RBF is also a fundamental piece of Lightning security model w.r.t time-sensitive transactions [0]\r\n\r\n[0] https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-November/001697.html",

Not everything though however people are free to use different RBF policies. There is no cultural norm. Users can already try any RBF policy and knots provides some options including full-rbf. \r\n\r\nFull RBF could fix some issues including vulnerable LN, DLC and coinjoin although these are not consensus rules and users, miners, etc. (including attackers) can use any policy.
