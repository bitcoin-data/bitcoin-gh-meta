As far as i can tell from discussions and the algorithm it's always been the opinion to err on the conservative side.\r\n\r\n> It's probably bad to include both sponsors and sponsees in CPFP situations?\r\n\r\nSponsees aren't included since transactions with mempool dependencies don't get considered for fee estimation. And i don't think we can do that until we find a proper way of considering packages in the fee estimator.",

      "body" : "(TL;DR your suggestion is best but i'm leaving the response to the first section for context)\r\n\r\nYeah it's a best effort. I could make sure that the descendant was also part of the block. Is it worth it though? If an ancestor-less transaction with mempool child that pay a higher feerate than itself got mined, the child probably got included as well (not necessarily, but i assumed very probably).\r\nDo you think that assumption isn't reasonable? My doubt is more with more convoluted packages. For instance:\r\n```\r\nA ------ D\r\n      __/ /\r\nB /      /\r\n      _ /\r\nC /\r\n```\r\nWith `A` 1sat/vb, `B` 10sat/vb, `C` 10sat/vb and `D` 1sat/vb. It would be a false positive for `A`. To prevent this we could simply condition the check on the descendants feerate of `A`:\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git a/src/policy/fees.cpp b/src/policy/fees.cpp\r\nindex 029dd108c3..5d5dfb2efe 100644\r\n--- a/src/policy/fees.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/policy/fees.cpp\r\n@@ -609,9 +609,12 @@ bool CBlockPolicyEstimator::processBlockTx(unsigned int nBlockHeight, const CTxM\r\n     // Note this check is only best-effort, as the child might not be part of the block.

I agree it's much better. It makes sure that the child was part of the same block. And your suggestion to only drop the ancestors whose feerates are lower than this transaction's covers the case i detailed above. Nice! Is that roughly what you were thinking about:\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git a/src/policy/fees.cpp b/src/policy/fees.cpp\r\nindex 029dd108c3..8c0e71ea18 100644\r\n--- a/src/policy/fees.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/policy/fees.cpp\r\n@@ -604,16 +604,6 @@ bool CBlockPolicyEstimator::processBlockTx(unsigned int nBlockHeight, const CTxM\r\n         return false;\r\n     }\r\n \r\n-    // Do not consider this transaction's feerate if it might have been mined due to one of\r\n-    // its children (CPFP).\r\n-    // Note this check is only best-effort, as the child might not be part of the block.

I wonder if a most sophisticated heuristic wouldn't be to qualify the sponsoring if the parent feerate is lower than your top mempool feerate group at block reception. Of course, considering block reception would make things free of block propagation allowing your mempool content to fluctuate though assuming perfect information propagation might be okay. \r\n\r\nI believe such situations could arise when there is no entity with the full-view of the package, in the sense that the CPFP can be attached by a different transaction issuer than the parent one. Therefore this second party might have different views of the mempool or more conservative fee-bumping strategy.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that type of situations is for now scarce enough than the current proposed heuristic `individual_feerate` > `ancestor_score` is good enough ?\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think it would be good to document the heuristic rational and the bounds here, in case of future changes in the ecosystem of Bitcoin applications invalidating this heuristic.

      "body" : "Thanks everyone for the interest, finally reviving this. Rebased and modernized the code (use static casts and named parameters, make use of batched RPC calls after #26656).\r\n\r\n@naumenkogs\r\n>  If we really want to check, we can measure how would fees differ by applying this change to historic blocks (?)\r\n\r\nWe'd also need historical snapshots of a mempool to do that. If someone has got some and is willing to test, i'd be very interested in seeing the results.\r\n\r\n> Otherwise, it would help if @darosior summarized the alternatives suggested in couple sentences (or helping in navigating the design scope e.g. \"what could be possibly done\").\r\n\r\nThe design space is actually quite narrow. Short of tracking packages, we can only get rid of invalid data points. I aim for the detection logic to be straightforward and conservative: better let a few invalid data points still go through rather than drop some valid ones.\r\nTo achieve this we go through the mempool entries that were included in a block when connecting it. We then apply two heuristics to determine whether it is a child paying for a parent we may be tracking for fee estimation:\r\n1. The individual feerate of this transaction is higher than its ancestor feerate. (Will be equal if it has no ancestor.)\r\n2. The individual feerate of the parent is lower than the individual feerate of this transaction. (Note it is not necessary to check if the parent itself has ancestors since if it does we wouldn't be tracking it for fee estimation.)\r\n\r\nIt was suggested by @mzumsande in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25380#discussion_r920292164 we may be able to get rid of the first heuristic, effectively only checking if a transaction we are tracking was mined along with a child transaction that has a higher feerate. I don't think it is correct, as the child transaction's effective feerate may be lower than the parent's. For instance:\r\n```\r\nA (1000sats; 100vb)\r\n                    \\\r\n                      C (1200sats; 100vb)\r\n                    /\r\nB (100sats; 100vb)\r\n```\r\nIn this diagram, `C` would be incorrectly accounted as a CPFP of `A` if we were to only use the second heuristic. However by using both heuristics `C` would still be detected as a CPFP of `B` (and only of `B`).\r\n\r\nAnother thing that could be done here is to take into account \"second-order\" CPFP. That is, if the child of the child of a transaction we are tracking for fee estimation is bumping. For instance (same as above + `D`):\r\n```\r\nA (1000sats; 100vb)\r\n                    \\\r\n                      C (1200sats; 100vb) -- D (10000sats; 100vb)\r\n                    /\r\nB (100sats; 100vb)\r\n```\r\nIn this diagram we would not be detecting neither `A` nor `B` as being CPFP'd. But solving this requires looking at the descendant feerate of an entry, which AFAICT brings a lot of complexity (and computation) to make sure we don't count a descendant multiple times in more complicated packages. In addition i suspect most CPFPs used on the network currently are \"first-order\" CPFPs (e.g. an \"accelerate\" button on a deposit on an onchain wallet, or anchor outputs for commitment transactions in Lightning).\r\nTherefore, even if it was reasonable to try to account for longer chains of CPFPs (which i'm not convinced it is), i'd be more inclined to not attempts to do so here. If we want to do this let's merge this simple and straightforward fix for most of the CPFP usage and try to tackle edge cases in a follow-up.\r\n\r\nFinally, i'm considering being more strict on the first heuristic. We could for instance require that the child is at least a 10% increase in feerate to be considered a CPFP. Because currently a parent would be considered to have been CPFP'd if it has a child with an individual feerate `0.001sat/vb` higher than its ancestor feerate. In this case i think the parent's feerate is still a good datapoint and we shouldn't get rid of it. What do you all think?",
