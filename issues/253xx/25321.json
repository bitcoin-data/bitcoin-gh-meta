   "body" : "Currently this is treated as misbehaviour with a score of 20 (out of 100). Practically, on my node no peer that hit a score of 20 hit the threshold of 100, so it seems fine to skip.\r\n\r\nEffectively, large \"vector\" messages will be dropped, making them a bandwidth DoS if sent repeatedly. However, any peer can do a bandwidth DoS by sending a \"vector\" messages of smaller size, or messages of type `notfound` (which don't have any misbehaviour score for size), or a large `block` or `tx` message.\r\n\r\nThis change skips over a `headers`, `getdata`, `inv`, `addr`, and `addrv2` message if it is too large.\r\n\r\nFor reference, there is no BIP that prescribes behaviour on oversized messages of those types. BIP 155 is the only BIP that mentions a size limit about the message types:\r\n\r\n> One message can contain up to 1,000 addresses. Clients SHOULD reject messages with more addresses.\r\n> https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0155#Specification\r\n\r\nFor reference, `getblocks` and `getheaders` since commit e254ff5d53b79bee29203b965fca572f218bff54 will unconditionally disconnect on size. It will even disconnect noban peers and manual connections, but this seems fine to keep.\r\n",
