Note that error messages have limited space and are not supposed to be documentation, though, so this can at most be a hint.\r\n\r\n- Add RPC documentation. At least mention in the help that the functions don't work with descriptor wallets. Adding instructions on how it can be done with descriptor wallets is even better, though also see next point.\r\n\r\n- Add a dedicated \"porting guide\" to port a code base from legacy wallets to descriptor wallets.\r\n\r\n- Make the functions backwards compatible. I don't personally like this very much, as it's just something that will be deprecated and removed again later in the interest of not cluttering the API.\r\n\r\n> I've never touched documentation for this project before, is it just to edit the object returned by importaddress function in backup.cpp that returns a RPCHelpMan object?\r\n\r\nYes.",

In this case, you can use 'importdescriptors' instead of 'importaddress'. The 'importdescriptors' RPC command allows you to import descriptors (a set of rules that define a range of addresses) into a descriptor wallet.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of how you can use 'importdescriptors' to import an address into a descriptor wallet:\r\n\r\n\r\nWrite this code:\r\n\r\n$ ./bitcoin-cli -regtest importdescriptors '[{\"desc\": \"addr(X)\", \"timestamp\": \"now\", \"range\": [0,1000], \"watchonly\": true, \"label\": \"test\"}]'\r\n\r\nThis command will import the descriptor 'addr'(X) into the descriptor wallet, with a label of test. The range parameter specifies the range of indices to generate addresses for, and the 'watchonly' parameter indicates that the wallet should only watch for transactions involving the imported addresses.\r\n\r\nNote that the 'importdescriptors' command requires a descriptor wallet, and will not work with legacy wallets. If you need to use legacy-only wallet functions, you may need to create a legacy wallet or use a different wallet software that supports these functions.",
