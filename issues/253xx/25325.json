   "body" : "A memory resource similar to `std::pmr::unsynchronized_pool_resource`, but optimized for node-based containers. The goal is to be able to cache more coins with the same memory usage, and allocate/deallocate faster.\r\n\r\nThis is a reimplementation of #22702. The goal was to implement it in a way that is simpler to review & test\r\n\r\n* There is now a generic `PoolResource` for allocating/deallocating memory. This has practically the same API as `std::pmr::memory_resource`. (Unfortunately I cannot use std::pmr because libc++ simply doesn't implement that API).\r\n* Thanks to sipa there is now a fuzzer for PoolResource! On a fast machine I ran it for ~770 million executions without finding any issue.\r\n\r\n* The estimation of the correct node size is now gone, PoolResource now has multiple pools and just needs to be created large enough to have space for the unordered_map nodes.\r\n\r\nI ran benchmarks with #22702, mergebase, and this PR. Frequency locked Intel i7-8700, clang++ 13.0.1 to reindex up to block 690000.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nbitcoind -dbcache=5000 -assumevalid=00000000000000000002a23d6df20eecec15b21d32c75833cce28f113de888b7 -reindex-chainstate -printtoconsole=0 -stopatheight=690000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe performance is practically identical with #22702, just 0.4% slower. It's ~21% faster than master:\r\n\r\n![Progress in Million Transactions over Time(2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14386/173288685-91952ade-f304-4825-8bfb-0725a71ca17b.png)\r\n\r\n![Size of Cache in MiB over Time](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14386/173291421-e6b410be-ac77-479b-ad24-5fafcebf81eb.png)\r\nNote that on cache drops mergebase's memory doesnt go so far down because it does not free the `CCoinsMap` bucket array.\r\n\r\n![Size of Cache in Million tx over Time(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14386/173288703-a80c9c9e-93c8-4a16-9df8-610c89c61cc4.png)\r\n",
