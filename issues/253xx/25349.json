   "body" : "Slightly refactor this code dating back to main.cpp as follows:\r\n \r\n- Remove the unused CDiskBlockIndex#ToString() class member, and mark the inherited CBlockIndex#ToString() public interface member as deleted to disallow calling it in the derived CDiskBlockIndex class\r\n- Rename the CDiskBlockIndex GetBlockHash() class member to ConstructBlockHash(), which also makes sense because they do different operations to return a blockhash, and mark the inherited CBlockIndex#GetBlockHash() public interface member as deleted for the same reason\r\n\r\nRationale and discussion:\r\n\r\nHere is a failing test on master that demonstrates the inconsistent behavior of the current design: calling the same inherited public interface functions on the same CDiskBlockIndex object should yield identical behavior, but does not.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/test/validation_chainstatemanager_tests.cpp b/src/test/validation_chainstatemanager_tests.cpp\r\nindex 6dc522b421..dac3840f32 100644\r\n--- a/src/test/validation_chainstatemanager_tests.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/test/validation_chainstatemanager_tests.cpp\r\n@@ -240,6 +240,15 @@ BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_CASE(chainstatemanager_activate_snapshot, TestChain100Setup)\r\n\r\n     const CBlockIndex* tip = chainman.ActiveTip();\r\n\r\n     BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(tip->nChainTx, au_data.nChainTx);\r\n\r\n+    // CDiskBlockIndex \"is a\" CBlockIndex, as it publicly inherits from it.\r\n+    // Test that calling the same inherited interface functions on the same\r\n+    // object yields identical behavior.\r\n+    CDiskBlockIndex index{tip};\r\n+    CBlockIndex *pB = &index;\r\n+    CDiskBlockIndex *pD = &index;\r\n+    BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(pB->GetBlockHash(), pD->GetBlockHash());\r\n+    BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(pB->ToString(), pD->ToString());\r\n```\r\n\r\n(build and run: `$ ./src/test/test_bitcoin -t validation_chainstatemanager_tests`)\r\n\r\nThe GetBlockHash() test assertion only passes on master because the different methods invoked by the current design happen to return the same result.  If one of the two is changed, it fails like the ToString() assertion does.\r\n\r\nRedefining inherited non-virtual functions is well-documented as incorrect design. Outside of critical hot spots, correctness usually comes before optimisation, but the current design dates back to main.cpp and it may possibly have been chosen to avoid the overhead of dynamic dispatch.  This solution does the same: the class sizes are unchanged and no vptr or vtbl is added here.\r\n\r\nIn general, there are better designs for doing this that separate the public interface from the private implementations.  One example would be a non-virtual public interface that calls private virtual implementation methods, i.e. the Template pattern via the Non-Virtual Interface (NVI) idiom. See https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin/commits/CBlockIndex-CDiskBlockIndex-class-design for a working implementation. Nevertheless, the dynamic vptr / vtbl overhead may be arguably unnecessary in this case.\r\n",
