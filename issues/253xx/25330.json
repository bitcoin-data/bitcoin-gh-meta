   "body" : "Currently many mutexes are recursive to accommodate for callers that have the mutex already locked. However, people seem not to like recursive mutexes, see also #19303.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there are many logic races in the codebase. (Not data races, which are UB, but code that returns valid, but logically inconsistent data. For example #25077).\r\n\r\nFor example, if a method wants to return the latest block hash and the height of that block, it could do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn { chain.tip_hash(), chain.tip_height() };\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssuming that `chain` has a private lock, which is acquired in its member methods. Though, in a multi-threaded context this may return a stale hash, which does not correspond to the height. So it would be nice to have a way to fix that, even if all locks are private and non-recursive.\r\n\r\nSo I was thinking about a helper that returns a locked chain to the caller:\r\n\r\n```\r\nauto lc{chain.locked()};\r\nreturn { lc.tip_hash(), lc.tip_height() };\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes this sound like a good idea?\r\n\r\n",
