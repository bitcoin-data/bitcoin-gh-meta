I don't think it would be good to do be suggesting alternatives and telling users to study all this other stuff. The point of having a software manage UTXOs and make transactions is to abstract all of that away from the user. You end with with decision paralysis or users choosing some \"obvious\" thing without understanding the nuance. I'm certain that if you presented the option for users to have a \"prefer lower fees\" coin selection, the vast majority of users would pick that and not realize that doing so will create a degenerate wallet in the long run.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20598#issuecomment-740970966\r\n\r\n> I think in the future it might make sense to offer different coin selection algorithms, because the one-size-fits-all doesn't really fit everyone. An algorithm that selects the least amount of input coins to reach the target (for a high feerate tx) could make sense in a wallet that regularly consolidates the change-spam with lower feerates.\r\n\r\n> Obviously, there is always the possibility to implement coin selection externally, but not all users of Bitcoin Core might have the expertise to do so.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20598#issuecomment-741581541\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> But I think we can use the priority since the algorithms can change and most user don't know their name.\r\n\r\n@brunoerg I have reviewed few coin selection related PRs, read few posts, tried reproducing lot of issues, experimenting and still don't know what all algorithms are used for coin selection by Bitcoin Core and how do they work. Since my priority is mostly privacy for personal transactions I prefer to use coin control and none of the coin selection algorithms however such algorithms can be useful for others especially exchanges. Sometimes even power users make mistakes so algorithms and saved configuration can help them.",

So, BnB can find a solution with 10 inputs and SRD finds one with 3 inputs but generating change, if the solution provided by SRD is more economic than the BnB one, it will be choose. However, I may not want the most economic, what if I want the solution that doesn't generate change (for privacy reason)? I don't think the users should know how the algorithms work, but it would be great if he could choose a strategy. Of course, those who wanna 100% privacy will choose the coins manually, but in some cases not everyone has this possibility.\r\n\r\nThanks for posting here that other issue, I am reading it..",
