If a user exists, they are better off backporting any fixes they need from the last still-supported branch and test them on their own infrastructure.\r\n* Community support of those branches is still possible, though this will need to be done in another project to relieve the burden on this project.\r\n* All release tags will remain, so no historic code is lost.",
