   "body" : "Taproot activates in [about 19 days](https://taproot.watch/) (2716 blocks), and it'd be nice if we set a good example and also support it in our MiniWallet. This PR changes the default mode from P2WSH (segwit v0 output, bech32 address) to P2TR (segwit v1 output, bech32m address) transactions type with the _anyone-can-spend_ policy, i.e. a witness script of `OP_TRUE`. The transition is actually quite painless, one only needs one extra piece in the form of a internal public key that is passed in the control block on the witness stack, in order to trigger script-path spending. To keep things simple, the lowest possible valid x-only-public key with the value of 1 was chosen as internal key.\r\nSince many tests expect to find outputs for the default scriptPubKey of MiniWallet in the pre-mined chain of the test framework, the generation address is also changed from `ADDRESS_BCRT1_P2WSH_OP_TRUE` to `create_deterministic_address_bcrt1_p2tr_op_true()[0]` accordingly (see method `BitcoinTestFramework._initialize_chain(...)`). Note that the pre-mined chain is cached locally, so you probably have to delete the `./test/cache` folder first for the tests to pass again.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid unnecessary renames, the import of `ADDRESS_BCRT1_P2WSH_OP_TRUE` is eliminated in rpc_blockchain.py by generating blocks directly to the MiniWallet address by using the `self.generate(self.wallet, ...)` interface (see first commit).\r\n",
