   "body" : "The most frequent failure in functional tests are intermittent races. Fixing such bugs is cumbersome because it involves:\r\n* Noticing the failure\r\n* Fetching and reading the log to determine the test case that failed\r\n* Adding a `self.sync_all()` where it was forgotten\r\n* Spamming out a pr and waiting for review, which is already sparse\r\n\r\nAlso, writing a linter to catch those is not possible, nor is review effective in finding these bugs prior to merge.\r\n\r\nFix all future intermittent races caused by a missing sync_block call by calling `sync_all` implicitly after each `generate*`, unless opted out. This ensures that the code is race-free (with regards to blocks) when the tests pass once, instead of our current approach where the code can never be guaranteed to be race-free.\r\n\r\nThere are some scripted-diff cleanups (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22567), but they will be submitted in a follow-up to reduce the conflicts in this pull.",
