Thanks!\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think about extending `sethdseed` support to more than 256 bits, _independent_ of BIP39?\r\n\r\nYes there exists a work-around as @sipa mentioned (convert the seed into a descriptor then import), but it seems weird to me that we have an artificial limit on the seed length primarily because we want to pigeonhole this seed into an internal data structure. Some users might desire stronger security than 256 bits. Perhaps it's not a high priority, but if we expect the `sethdseed` interface to stick around for the long term (pls correct me if that's not the case), it might make sense to increase the length at some point, no?\r\n\r\n",

Misread words could cause seemingly \"tragic fund loss\" problems potentially. \r\n\r\nHowever, just like what the OP said in the beginning:\r\n\r\n> It is currently supported by some of the most popular wallets on the market.
