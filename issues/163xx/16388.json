   "body" : "Hey team,\r\n\r\nAdding a feature request here for the ability to query all utxos for a given address(s) regardless if it's in the nodes wallet or not.\r\n\r\nI understand the reasoning here of why it's not included out-of-the-box as it could add a significant amount of overhead to the core requirements of running the node.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's fairly concerning that the most of the articles about how to get this functionality just point to using an external api to fetch this info. Tutorials of how to get this functionality on the developer side are also painful when just trying to get this fairly common feature up and running. Isn't part of the point of running a full node to be able to get anything you need without the reliance of a third party? \"Don't trust, verify\"\r\n\r\nI would imagine the best implementation for this would be to add a flag in the `bitcoin.conf` of something like `indexAddrs=1` or something like that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just putting the idea out there. Thanks\r\n",
