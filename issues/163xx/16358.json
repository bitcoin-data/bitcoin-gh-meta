   "body" : "This PR:\r\n- makes the wallet upgrade a method of `CWallet`\r\n- adds a RPC command: `upgradewallet`\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\nUser with wallet created with old version of bitcoin-core were not able to use v0.18 because of a keypool error (#16091). If their wallet was encrypted they could not even upgrade the wallet and thus v0.18 became unusable.\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nI don't know how to write a test for this feature : I could not even find a test for the wallet upgrade functionnality. However I hand-tested and succesfully upgraded with v0.18 a wallet created with 0.11.1.",
