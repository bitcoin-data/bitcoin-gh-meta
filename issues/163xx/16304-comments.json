If you broadcast transactions that have a feerate lower than the feefilter you send out, you are explicitly telling everyone that they most likely originated at your node. (See BIP 133 for details on feefilter).\r\nAlso, in a network where most nodes are Bitcoin Core, and most Bitcoin Core nodes run with the default settings, it is hard to propagate a transaction that is rejected due to the mempool default limits.\r\n\r\nI see that you manually set the mempool limit to a lower threshold. So, your transaction might  propagate to peers, assuming that the feefilter your peers sent you indicate a lower feerate than the one your txs pay.\r\n\r\nIf you understand what you are doing, you can (before sending the tx to your mempool) mock the feerate of the tx with `prioritisetransaction`, then send the tx as usual.",
