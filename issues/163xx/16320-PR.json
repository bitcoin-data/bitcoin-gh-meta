   "body" : "Add Travis check to make sure unit test coverage reports stay deterministic.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nA necessary condition for meaningful line coverage measuring is that the test suite\r\nis deterministic in the sense that the set of lines executed at least once is identical between test suite runs.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses issue #14343 (MarcoFalke): \"coverage reports non-deterministic\":\r\n\r\n> Our unit tests and functional tests are non-deterministic in the overall execution, but the coverage should not be affected by that. I.e. some functions might be executed in a different order or sometimes skipped, but every line, function and branch should be executed at least once.\r\n> \r\n> This is currently not true, even for serialization errors that should be hit exactly once.\r\n> \r\n> Beside the obvious issue of missing test coverage on some runs, this also makes it impossible to see how test coverage changes between two commits.\r\n\r\nExample output in case of line coverage deterministic unit tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2019-06-30 08:32:59] Measuring coverage, run #1 of 3\r\n[2019-06-30 08:36:38] Measuring coverage, run #2 of 3\r\n[2019-06-30 08:40:15] Measuring coverage, run #3 of 3\r\n\r\nCoverage test passed: Deterministic coverage across 3 runs.\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample output in case of line coverage non-deterministic unit tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2019-06-30 08:32:59] Measuring coverage, run #1 of 3\r\n[2019-06-30 08:36:38] Measuring coverage, run #2 of 3\r\n\r\nThe line coverage is non-deterministic between runs.\r\n\r\nThe test suite must be deterministic in the sense that the set of lines executed at least\r\nonce must be identical between runs.

I'm currently using `x86_64 Linux  [GOAL: install]  [bionic]  [uses qt5 dev package instead of depends Qt to speed up build and avoid timeout]`, but I'm afraid the total run-time of that job is a bit on the high end with this check included. Would it be preferable to add a new job instead of adding to an existing job? Please advice :-)",
