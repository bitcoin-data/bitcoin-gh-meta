Consensus is the foundation of the network and miners are the only consensus that matters. Nobody else can enforce the protocol if the miners do not cooperate. If a majority of miners decide they are going to change the protocol, it's changed. If enough miners disagree with the change then we have a fork. The only question that remains is which (or if) one of the forks will die.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that prevents miners from taking over the network thus far is self-interest. Meaning, thus far it has been judged to be more profitable to let Core set the rules, more or less. That balance may change. For example, perhaps miners will decide \"no more halving\" and so maintain block rewards while causing a permanent inflation.",
