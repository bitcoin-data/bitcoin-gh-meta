There is no need to edit the label of a payment request as there is no need to reuse an address. \r\n\r\nLet's consider two scenarios: \r\n1) Made a mistake with the label, didn't realize until after the payment request was created\r\n    - Just create a new payment request, no need to reuse the address.\r\n2) You want to make a new Payment Request. You had previously made one that has the same `amount` and `message` you want. You just need to edit the `Label`\r\n    - We do not want to encourage this behavior, do not re-use an address. Just create a new payment request.\r\n",
