I left the prune setting to the default 2Gb.\r\nWhen I woke up it was up to November 2017, and the date on my wallet file was October 2017, so I figured I'd load it up and see if it had anything in it.\r\nI closed the core client completely, copied the wallet file to the wallets folder, and restarted core.\r\nIt gave this error and then closed when I hit OK.\r\nI started core up again and it's acting normally, continuing to download. The wallet screen says balance info is out of date, but that's the only indication it's not caught up.\r\nI have another half a day probably for it to catch up - not sure what will happen when it does, but figured I'd report the error.",
