   "body" : "Hi,I've encountered difficulties and need help. \r\nI've got a USDT address and want to get the BTC unspentlist for transfee,   I do the command \r\nlistunspent 0 99999 \"[\\\"\\\"]\" in the OmniCore wallet,but find it always lost transactions, and the result is not correct. Then I think maybe I can check it in the Bitcoin Core wallet, but unfortunately I got a transaction in the result list that was already spent.Why does this already spent transaction still exist in the unspentlist? Cannot I check the unspentlist of USDT address in the Bitcoin Core wallet ?",
