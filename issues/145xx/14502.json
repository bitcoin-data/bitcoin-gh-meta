   "body" : "Inspired by some discussions about RPC documentations ( #14399, #14378 ) I have decided to create a RPC help helper class, that automatically formats the RPC help.\r\n\r\nThis should be helpful in few respects:\r\n* it makes the code cleaner\r\n* it formats the help automatically\r\n* in the future (I am leaving this for a follow-up PR), it can allow to export JSON, which will allow to make nicer HTML documentation :)\r\n\r\nThe new classes are in rpc/doc.cpp and they are added in the first commit\r\n\r\nThe second commit is the actual doc rewrite. The process of rewriting current docs to what is in the PR was semi-automatic - unfortunately, not automatic enough to make it a scripted diff. What I did:\r\n\r\n* wrote a parser of the current RPC documentation\r\n* made some changes to the RPC help to be parseable\r\n* generated the code in the PR from that\r\n* manually cleaned up the code on a lot of places\r\n\r\nIt's still a huge chunk of code, even when it is just RPC help.\r\n\r\n(Third commit is then removing the unused helper function.)\r\n\r\nI think it does the same what @achow101 has been trying (by adding what I have in RPCDoc to UniValue instead) here https://github.com/achow101/bitcoin/tree/rpc-help-univ ; I did not use that because I did not fully understand how it was supposed to be working\r\n",
