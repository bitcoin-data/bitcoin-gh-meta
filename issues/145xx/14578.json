You will have to forgive me, I lost the reference to the original article/issue that I read where it said if you batched too many transactions it would fail.\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n**Expecting:** One transaction in the batch to fail, the rest to execute normally\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n**Actual:** All transactions in the batch fail, causing other programs such as NOMP which use them to fail = no payments to miners!\r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n**Reproduce:**\r\na) Make a batch RPC call to send to 50-100 addresses\r\nb) Make a batch RPC call to send to a few addresses, one of them being invalid\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nUsing a fork of a fork of (probably a fork) of bitcoin core. This affects all forks of bitcoin - literally all of them. Hopefully they will merge the fix to the batch RPC send.\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n**Machine:** Vultr VPS ($10/Mth - 1 CPU, 2048 MB RAM, 40GB disk)\r\n\r\nI will make work arounds in NOMP. Then I will search for where I saw about batch transactions and post a reference link here. You may already have an open issue (I checked briefly, cant find)\r\n\r\nThanks",
