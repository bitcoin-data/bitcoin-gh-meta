See the picture below. It's either warning OR error, but not Warning: Error occured, since it's not informative, keys are ok, that is what counts, but some labels may be missing - not a big deal really, to scare user with error. \r\n\r\nIt gets better: when loaded wallet shows one of older transactions as most recent one (total wallet assets is ok, but tx got displayed twice with correct and recent timestamp)\r\n\r\nNot sure if system is relevant here, but it's still win7 ultimate x64 eng\r\nSteps to reproduce: \r\n\r\n1.  try to load wallet file previously backed up a while ago, and named the same way as recently closed wallet file.\r\n2. Warning: Error displayed, looks like nothing really happens while it's displayed - close the opening wallet modal, close warning.\r\n3. Load that wallet file again, no warning gets displayed now, wait for wallet to load\r\n4. Check transactions tab\r\n\r\nHope that helps\r\n![Error_or_warning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10043733/80637804-3fcf3f00-8a68-11ea-8984-3d3b744ef9f3.jpg)\r\n![double_tx_display](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10043733/80637818-42ca2f80-8a68-11ea-811b-499c7a28ab0f.jpg)\r\n\r\n",
