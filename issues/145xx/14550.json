To that support goal, I'd like a \"start minimized\" option in your settings area, and it might be useful to keep the existing state between runs (after system shuts down) as an alternative \"no extra user work required\" version.  Versus needing them to dig in dialogs to find this setting when they likely want to not be bothered by your app if they'd minimized it before.  I'm on Windows 10, 64 bit if that matters.",
