   "body" : "I am running my bitcoin node (`v0.17.0`) at home on my DSL network. My ISP terminates my connection every 24 hours and due to this I get a different IPv4 address every day. This also applies to IPv6 - although here I get a different /64 prefix each day. \r\n\r\nWhen I start `bitcoind` and let it run for a few minutes it will successfully connect to the bitcoin network and `bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo | jq '.localaddresses'` will show e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"address\": \"2001:18c8:2851:e900:979c:f155:XXYY:ZZ1c\",\r\n    \"port\": 8333,\r\n    \"score\": 1\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"address\": \"2001:18c8:2851:e900:ffea:fd8e:XXYY:ZZ37\",\r\n    \"port\": 8333,\r\n    \"score\": 882\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `2001:18c8:2851:e900` part here is a dynamic prefix. This will change every 24 hours. Waiting 1-2 day I can run `bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo | jq '.localaddresses'`  again and **it will show exactly the same addresses**. But my DSL router will no longer have this IPv6 prefix assigned. Running `ip -6 a` will also confirm that I no longer have an IPv6 address with global address that starts with `2001:18c8:2851:e900`.\r\n\r\n**I do have active connections the bitcoin network on IPv6. Therefore I belief this is more a cosmetic than a functional issue!**\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I have any wrong assumptions, am doing something wrong or what else I need to provide so that this issue can be checked.",
