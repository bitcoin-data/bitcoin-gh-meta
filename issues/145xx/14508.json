This results in nodes asking pruned peers for blocks, and promptly being disconnected.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/816fab9ccae568612d5ed90378b4587256925a1e/src/net_processing.cpp#L3693-L3710\r\n\r\nWhile this is fine and all, it does result in some weird unexpected behavior when a node knows *mostly* pruned nodes as it will end up inexplicably dropped from a bunch of its peers for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\n~~I have proposed a fix for this in #14507 which tracks the peer's known best block and avoids asking pruned peers for blocks that would potentially result in violating the limit above, but I figured I should post an issue as well, so we have this tracked.~~",
