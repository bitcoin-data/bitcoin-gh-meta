      "body" : "Seconded. I have been using Bitcoin for a couple of days, and while many users will not care about the details, I want to know (at least during my initial testing of the system) exactly how it works. This will help me, and other tech-savvy users understand the security implications.\n\nTo me, the biggest \"black box\" of the whole system is the wallet. It's a binary blob which I am told to keep backed up or else. It's unclear to me how I would restore it without erasing recent transactions. I'm not sure which data is stored in it and which is not -- from the look of some other bugs here, it seems to store more data than just the public/private keys (such as config data). Does it store the names I have associated with the addresses? (I wouldn't want to lose my PC, restore my wallet.dat, and discover I can't tell who sent me what, so I'd hope it does store those names.) Does it store sending addresses? (I don't think it should, as that's more of an address book than a crucial wallet.) And it isn't encrypted with a password.\n\nI'm not asking for answers to these questions -- I can find them out if I really want to. I'm saying that these answers should be immediately obvious from inspecting the wallet file. There should be nothing \"magical\" about this file, for an advanced user.\n\nI would like to see a transition to a \"Wallet 2.0\" file format, which is simply a PGP-encrypted text file (so, binary, but a simple gpg -d will get the text out). I should be able to encrypt it with either a symmetric or public key.\n\nInside the file, there would be a simple ASCII format, such as:\n&lt;address&gt; (active|inactive) [name] &lt;pub-key&gt; &lt;priv-key&gt;\n\nwith one address per line (or split into \"sections\" if the pub-key and priv-key are too long to put on a single line). The active|inactive determines whether the address shows up as a receive address in the GUI (so when it pre-generates 100 addresses, they all show up here, and are all marked inactive until the user presses \"New Address\" in the UI).\n\nThis would only contain receiving addresses. Sending addresses would be in a separate address book file, which would hopefully also be a text file, and I could back up too if I wanted to but isn't critical.\n\nNow, at a glance, I (as a technical user) can tell exactly what data is stored in the wallet. And it should be significantly easier to write tools for listing all the money associated with each account in the wallet, splitting up a wallet into separate files, and so on.\n",

      "body" : "There has been some discussion relating to a so-called \".bitkeys\" format, which would be a standardised human-readable text file format for storing Bitcoin private key data. It seems to have been suggested here by [mike]:\n[http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=3638.40](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=3638.40)\n\nI don't know if the format discussion has moved elsewhere, but you should try to be compatible with this format.\n\nBasically, this means your file should start with v=1 (version, I assume). Exporter should write v=1, importer should check for v=1.\n\nOtherwise, what you suggest is almost right, but the private key and block number should be comma-separated:\nbase58 encoded privkey,block number  # comment\n\nEverything after the hash is a comment. You said it was \"optional\" but that sort of implies that your software will possibly be looking for an address and available BTC. It should not, since the format should allow arbitrary machine-ignored text after the #. So your exporter should write # [address] [available BTC] or whatever you want, but your importer should completely ignore everything after the comment and just use the privatekey to derive the public key and address.\n\nAlso note, if you haven't written the code for this already, that I already implemented, in C using OpenSSL, the code to take a 32-byte private key and generate the full 279-byte DER key (which Bitcoin internally calls the \"private key\") and 65-byte public key. My intention was for my code to eventually be used inside Bitcoin itself, so please use it if you can:\n- [bitcoin-import Bazaar branch](https://code.launchpad.net/~mgiuca/+junk/bitcoin-import)\n- [priv_der.c](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~mgiuca/+junk/bitcoin-import/view/head:/priv_der.c)\n\nIt is currently a command-line program which takes the private key as input and produces the DER key (of which the public key is a substring), but it is very well documented and could easily be adapted into a bitkeys file reader.\n",
