I'd be satisfied with commerce systems including a business rule which says \"if you want further notifications, attach an email address to your order\". The spam problem is already addressed broadly in the email domain, and email addresses can be rather anonymous.\n\nSigning an email with the bitcoin key is a neat idea, but there's a lack of symmetry in the typical commerce application. Customer learns a bitcoin address for vendor, so vendor can later sign messages back to customer using that address's private key. Not so in the reverse, unless the customer provides an address of their own as part of the exchange.\n\nWhat I would like to see is the ability to attach a small, optional data field to a transaction. For example, here in Slovakia, the banking system provides for the attachment of several fields to an electronic payment: constant symbol (4), variable symbol (10), specific symbol (16?), note (32?). The constant symbol is used for tax accounting purposes, and the rest are used to correlate payments with accounts, similar to \"please be sure to include your account/invoice number on your check\".\n\nI'm guessing this is already provided for in the protocol, though I'm not familiar with that part of the implementation. Also, it's arguable that it's not necessary if a merchant generates a new bitcoin address for each payment. Not a big priority, really.\n",

Notifications/polling could be integrated into the GUI application.\n\nAgain, everything out-of-band (not messing with the existing payment infrastructure), and it depends (at least for the encryption part) on a bitcoin receiver address functioning as an encryption key (does it?).\n",
