We'd need an input field to paste in the transaction (which is really just a key pair).  It's really just export/import with the official client by default deleting the private key on export (possibly with a huge warning to make sure you copied the text somewhere safe).  It makes sense to work on this feature after a mechanism for controlling which coins get included in a transaction, since the user will want to know how many coins are at a specific address before sending off the private key (to another wallet or another person).\n\nAppropriate new API calls should be created too.\n",
