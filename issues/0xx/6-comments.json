People won't want to pay transaction fees when consolidating or moving btc value between different wallets they own.  Also, easy import/export should be treated like moving (rather than copying) to prevent keys from ending up in multiple, concurrently active wallets (backup should be used for ensuring you don't lose keys).\n\nI think I'll create a separate issue for this (since it is straying from this topic).\n\nAs for treating the wallet as a generic key store or using existing key store solutions, I think it's better to stay away from that in the short term.  That could pose quite a few technical and integration challenges, and if not done very carefully, could pose a security risk (you would be putting bitcoin users at the mercy of third party key storage solutions that may or may not be very well implemented). \n",
