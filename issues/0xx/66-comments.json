Address Book Receiving tab uses \"Label.\"  3. Documentation Wiki and API method calls use \n\"account\"  to mean both.  The term \"Address Book\" does not appear anywhere on this page: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Accounts_explained \n\nWhile we're at it the \"Sending\" tab of Address Book confuses me every time I look at it, it implies a list of my accounts to use to send from, but it's actually a list of recipient addresses.  Maybe we should change Sending to say Contacts, and change Receiving to say My Accounts.  \n\nSuggestion: Change Address Book field names \"Name\" and \"Label\" to \"Account Name\" for consistency.  \n\nSuggest editing https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list to add hyperlinks for each occurrence of \"account\" to https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Accounts_explained\n\nAfter client field changes above, edit https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Accounts_explained to include language clarifying that the account API covers both tabs of the Address Book and the client separates them based on whether it has the private key.\n",
