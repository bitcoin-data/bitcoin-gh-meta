   "body" : "Hi,\r\nUsing Bitcoin Core RPC client version v0.17.0.1-g1476554d3b1db5352c0de1de7524864d4bce3aac\r\n\r\nI'm using bitcoin-cli loadwallet and unloadwallet commands. They both seem to work fine.\r\nUnfortunately, memory is getting higher and higher, and no wallet can be loaded after 300 have been.\r\nThe problem may be related to BerkeleyDB rather than to Bitcoin Core itself. Fact is that lsof shows handles not cleared off after the unloadwallet command is issued. Files still handled are .walletlock, db.log and database/log.0000000001 .\r\nWhen 300 different wallets have been loaded/unloaded, used RAM is over 8 GB, and bitcoind will finally become unstable and fail.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\nRegards,",
