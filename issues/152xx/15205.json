   "body" : "Currently, the potential for a deadlock exists if `ActivateBestChain()` is called from within the `ValidationInterface` scheduler thread. This is because ABC itself avoids overrunning the VI queue by waiting for it to drain once it has passed a certain depth.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this (or at least disallow it during CI runs), this change introduces thread_local state that gets set to indicate execution on ValidationInterface threads. If we've compiled with `DEBUG_LOCKORDER`, calling ABC from within a VI thread throws an exception. A small, ~~necessary~~ refactoring on `CMainSignals` is included.\r\n\r\nThis changeset also includes a commit from #13168 that limits the platforms where we can rely on the use of thread_local.",
