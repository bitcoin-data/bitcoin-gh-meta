If you need to generate\n+static login credentials for your programs, you can use the script in\n+the `share/rpcauth` directory in the Bitcoin Core source tree.  As a\n+final fallback, you can directly use manually-chosen `rpcuser` and\n+`rpcpassword` configuration parameters---but you must ensure that you\n+choose a strong and unique passphrase (and still don't use insecure\n+networks, as mentioned above).\n+\n+The RPC interface does not guarantee any escaping of data beyond what's",

Electrum, from I remember, does have those CORS headers, because it consists of a \"server\" and a (javascript based) GUI \"client\". The problem there was that not just the client could talk to the server, but any website could. \r\n  \r\nBecause of these missing headers, websites can't communicate with the RPC. Even if they could, they would need to know the username & password.\r\n\r\nThere's also a REST API which is unauthenticated, but only shows public info like blocks; it doesn't expose the wallet. It currently doesn't have CORS headers and probably shouldn't, but not so much for security reasons as for scope creep. See the discussion in #12040 for more context.",
