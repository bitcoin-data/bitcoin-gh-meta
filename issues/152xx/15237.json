   "body" : "From practical standpoint it would be a user friendly feature if the Bitcoin Core client would display the amounts both in BTC (as it does now) and in a preferred fiat currency.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to make a decimal mistake with BTC now if we need to enter an amount manually, and it's also difficult to guess if the transaction fee we choose is low enough to our taste without knowing its value in a more familiar fiat currency that we use every day.\r\n\r\nI think it would be great to have an option to select a fiat currency in Settings / Options / Display, just like we have now with the BTC/mBTC/uBTC/Satoshi dropdown.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core then could use a 3rd party provider to get the current BTC/USD price and the USD/[preferred currency] and calculate the estimated fiat value of any BTC amount used in the client.\r\n\r\nThis fiat value would be displayed in a few places by default (Overview/Total, Send/Amount, Confirm Send Coins dialog) and could be displayed only as a tooltip in other places.\r\n\r\n3rd-party providers:\r\n* xe.com supports many fiats and some cryptos (including BTC), but they have [only paid API plans](https://www.xe.com/xecurrencydata/#price-section)\r\n* fixer.io has a [free plan](https://fixer.io/product), but they don't support cryptos as far as I know\r\n* CoinMarketCap has [a free API plan as well](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/pricing/), that could be used for the USD/BTC pair\r\n\r\n(I'm not sure it matters, but I'm running Bitcoin Core 0.17.1 x64 on Windows 10.)",
