Always check the amount and the receiving address before sending coins.\r\n\r\n> These are your Bitcoin addresses for receiving payments. It is recommended to use a new receiving address for each transaction.\r\n\r\nSo what is exactly *\"your\"* Bitcoin addresses? For example, a confused user might think that he could \"fake\" the sending address when he is trying to pay another people.\r\n\r\nI think this might be improved, for example:\r\n> You may send payments to these known Bitcoin addresses. Always check the amount and the receiving address before sending coins.\r\n\r\n> These Bitcoin addresses are yours, you may use them to receive payments. It is recommended to use a new receiving address for each transaction.",
