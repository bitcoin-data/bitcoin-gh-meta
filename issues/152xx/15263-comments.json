Just checking if I understand the rationale correctly, in the proposed descriptor importmulti : \r\n<img width=\"919\" alt=\"schermafbeelding 2019-01-30 om 13 34 38\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/51981600-db53b780-2493-11e9-8a43-11ac1a2f8967.png\">\r\n\r\nThis currently [doesn't import the public keys](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14491#issuecomment-457420341), only the scripts. That can be solved by adding `outkeys`  to `pubkey_map`, but this would also add all public keys in a multisig descriptor.\r\n\r\nLater on in the import process `pubkey_map` is used to add each pub key as watch-only to the wallet (if it's not already present):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"999\" alt=\"schermafbeelding 2019-01-30 om 13 47 28\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/51982217-9fb9ed00-2495-11e9-93f8-2fb1e74c7bfd.png\">\r\n\r\nThis in turn is relevant for `AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe` which for each new transaction in a block checks if it needs to be added to a wallet. It does that when `IsMine()` is true for any output (which can mean `ISMINE_WATCH_ONLY`, `ISMINE_SPENDABLE` or both). That in turn depends on ` txout.scriptPubKey`, which is handled through `IsMineInner(...., IsMineSigVersion::TOP)`. \r\n\r\nThat's where my brain gives up, but I'm guessing that `IsMineInner` will return `>0` if an output pays to a public key (hash). That would be bad if that public key belongs to a different member of the multisig group. Conversely, I'm assuming that if we don't take the additional step - on top of adding the script - of adding a public key, then IsMine won't recognize the transaction as belonging to the user. ",

This is safe because they weren't actually needed for the first effect, and has the added benefit that when combined with the importmulti code will cause these multisig individual keys to not become watched.\r\n\r\nHowever, it does keep the effect that when you import say a P2WPKH descriptor, the pubkey will be expanded, and then imported, causing P2PKH outputs for the same key to also become watched. Thankfully, that is \"policy compatible\" - anyone able to spend a P2WPKH output would also be able to spend the P2PKH version. It's unfortunate, but not a disaster. The full solution will be descriptor based IsMine logic, where we can exactly control what is treated as ours.",
