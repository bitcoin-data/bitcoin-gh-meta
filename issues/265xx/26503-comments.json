      "diff_hunk" : "@@ -0,0 +1,387 @@\n+24.0 Release Notes\n+==================\n+\n+Bitcoin Core version *24.0* is now available from:\n+\n+  <https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-24.0/>\n+\n+This release includes new features, various bug fixes and performance\n+improvements, as well as updated translations.\n+\n+Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:\n+\n+  <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues>\n+\n+To receive security and update notifications, please subscribe to:\n+\n+  <https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/>\n+\n+How to Upgrade\n+==============\n+\n+If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notice of new option for transaction replacement policies\n+=========================================================\n+\n+This version of Bitcoin Core adds a new `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option which allows users to change the policy their individual node\n+will use for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions.  The option\n+defaults to the same policy that was used in previous releases and no\n+changes to node policy will occur if everyone uses the default.\n+\n+Some Bitcoin services today expect that the first version of an\n+unconfirmed transaction that they see will be the version of the\n+transaction that ultimately gets confirmed---a transaction acceptance\n+policy sometimes called \"first seen\".\n+\n+The Bitcoin Protocol does not, and cannot, provide any assurance that\n+the first version of an unconfirmed transaction seen by a particular\n+node will be the version that gets confirmed.  If there are multiple\n+versions of the same unconfirmed transaction available, only the miner\n+who includes one of those transactions in a block gets to decide which\n+version of the transaction gets confirmed.\n+\n+Despite this lack of assurance, multiple merchants and services today\n+still make this assumption.\n+\n+There are several benefits to users from removing this *first-seen*\n+simplification.  One key benefit, the ability for the sender of a\n+transaction to replace it with an alternative version paying higher\n+fees, was realized in [Bitcoin Core 0.12.0][] (February 2016) with the\n+introduction of [BIP125][] opt-in Replace By Fee (RBF).\n+\n+Since then, there has been discussion about completely removing the\n+first-seen simplification and allowing users to replace any of their\n+older unconfirmed transactions with newer transactions, a feature called\n+*full-RBF*.  This release includes a `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n+(allowing only opt-in RBF).\n+\n+Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\n+default for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\n+advocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\n+full-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\n+fees may rapidly become more reliable.\n+\n+Members of this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\n+not accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\n+to take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\n+when their assumptions do not hold.\n+\n+[Bitcoin Core 0.12.0]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\n+[bip125]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\n+  has been reworked.  This is particularly relevant for nodes starting up for the\n+  first time (or for nodes which are starting up after being offline for a long time).\n+\n+  Whenever headers are received from a peer that have a total chainwork that is either\n+  less than the node's `-minimumchainwork` value or is sufficiently below the work at\n+  the node's tip, a \"presync\" phase will begin, in which the node will download the\n+  peer's headers and verify the cumulative work on the peer's chain, prior to storing\n+  those headers permanently. Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,\n+  the headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.\n+\n+  This may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for\n+  the first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effect\n+  of a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node's best headers chain has less\n+  than `-minimumchainwork`), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanism\n+  with the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again). (#25717)\n+\n+- With I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outbound\n+  connection if `-i2pacceptincoming=0`. (#25355)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=softforks` configuration option has been removed.  The\n+  RPC `getblockchaininfo` no longer returns the `softforks` field, which was\n+  previously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status is\n+  now only available via the `getdeploymentinfo` RPC.\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase` configuration option has been removed.\n+  The `receivedby` RPCs (`listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`,\n+  `getreceivedbyaddress` and `getreceivedbylabel`) now always return results\n+  accounting for received coins from coinbase outputs, without an option to\n+  change that behaviour. Excluding coinbases was previously deprecated in 23.0.\n+  (#25171)\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=fees` configuration option has been removed. The top-level\n+  fee fields `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees` are no\n+  longer returned by RPCs `getmempoolentry`, `getrawmempool(verbose=true)`,\n+  `getmempoolancestors(verbose=true)` and `getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)`.\n+  The same fee fields can be accessed through the `fees` object in the result.\n+  The top-level fee fields were previously deprecated in 23.0. (#25204)\n+\n+- The `getpeerinfo` RPC has been updated with a new `presynced_headers` field,\n+  indicating the progress on the presync phase mentioned in the\n+  \"P2P and network changes\" section above.\n+\n+Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- The `sendall` RPC spends specific UTXOs to one or more recipients\n+  without creating change. By default, the `sendall` RPC will spend\n+  every UTXO in the wallet. `sendall` is useful to empty wallets or to\n+  create a changeless payment from select UTXOs. When creating a payment\n+  from a specific amount for which the recipient incurs the transaction\n+  fee, continue to use the `subtractfeefromamount` option via the\n+  `send`, `sendtoaddress`, or `sendmany` RPCs. (#24118)\n+\n+- A new `gettxspendingprevout` RPC has been added, which scans the mempool to find\n+  transactions spending any of the given outpoints. (#24408)\n+\n+- The `simulaterawtransaction` RPC iterates over the inputs and outputs of the given\n+  transactions, and tallies up the balance change for the given wallet. This can be\n+  useful e.g. when verifying that a coin join like transaction doesn't contain unexpected\n+  inputs that the wallet will then sign for unintentionally. (#22751)\n+\n+Updated REST APIs\n+-----------------\n+\n+- The `/headers/` and `/blockfilterheaders/` endpoints have been updated to use\n+  a query parameter instead of path parameter to specify the result count. The\n+  count parameter is now optional, and defaults to 5 for both endpoints. The old\n+  endpoints are still functional, and have no documented behaviour change.\n+\n+  For `/headers`, use\n+  `GET /rest/headers/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`\n+  instead of\n+  `GET /rest/headers/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)\n+\n+  For `/blockfilterheaders/`, use\n+  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`\n+  instead of\n+  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)\n+\n+  (#24098)\n+\n+Build System\n+------------\n+\n+- Guix builds are now reproducible across architectures (x86_64 & aarch64). (#21194)\n+\n+New settings\n+------------\n+\n+- A new `mempoolfullrbf` option has been added, which enables the mempool to\n+  accept transaction replacement without enforcing BIP125 replaceability\n+  signaling.

This release includes a `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n+(allowing only opt-in RBF).\n+\n+Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\n+default for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\n+advocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\n+full-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\n+fees may rapidly become more reliable.\n+\n+Members of this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\n+not accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\n+to take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\n+when their assumptions do not hold.\n+\n+[Bitcoin Core 0.12.0]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\n+[bip125]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\n+  has been reworked.  This is particularly relevant for nodes starting up for the\n+  first time (or for nodes which are starting up after being offline for a long time).\n+\n+  Whenever headers are received from a peer that have a total chainwork that is either\n+  less than the node's `-minimumchainwork` value or is sufficiently below the work at\n+  the node's tip, a \"presync\" phase will begin, in which the node will download the\n+  peer's headers and verify the cumulative work on the peer's chain, prior to storing\n+  those headers permanently. Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,\n+  the headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.\n+\n+  This may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for\n+  the first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effect\n+  of a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node's best headers chain has less\n+  than `-minimumchainwork`), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanism\n+  with the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again). (#25717)\n+\n+- With I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outbound\n+  connection if `-i2pacceptincoming=0`. (#25355)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=softforks` configuration option has been removed.  The\n+  RPC `getblockchaininfo` no longer returns the `softforks` field, which was\n+  previously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status is\n+  now only available via the `getdeploymentinfo` RPC.\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase` configuration option has been removed.\n+  The `receivedby` RPCs (`listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`,\n+  `getreceivedbyaddress` and `getreceivedbylabel`) now always return results\n+  accounting for received coins from coinbase outputs, without an option to\n+  change that behaviour. Excluding coinbases was previously deprecated in 23.0.\n+  (#25171)\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=fees` configuration option has been removed. The top-level\n+  fee fields `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees` are no\n+  longer returned by RPCs `getmempoolentry`, `getrawmempool(verbose=true)`,\n+  `getmempoolancestors(verbose=true)` and `getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)`.\n+  The same fee fields can be accessed through the `fees` object in the result.\n+  The top-level fee fields were previously deprecated in 23.0. (#25204)\n+\n+- The `getpeerinfo` RPC has been updated with a new `presynced_headers` field,\n+  indicating the progress on the presync phase mentioned in the\n+  \"P2P and network changes\" section above.\n+\n+Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- The `sendall` RPC spends specific UTXOs to one or more recipients\n+  without creating change. By default, the `sendall` RPC will spend\n+  every UTXO in the wallet. `sendall` is useful to empty wallets or to\n+  create a changeless payment from select UTXOs. When creating a payment\n+  from a specific amount for which the recipient incurs the transaction\n+  fee, continue to use the `subtractfeefromamount` option via the\n+  `send`, `sendtoaddress`, or `sendmany` RPCs. (#24118)\n+\n+- A new `gettxspendingprevout` RPC has been added, which scans the mempool to find\n+  transactions spending any of the given outpoints. (#24408)\n+\n+- The `simulaterawtransaction` RPC iterates over the inputs and outputs of the given\n+  transactions, and tallies up the balance change for the given wallet. This can be\n+  useful e.g. when verifying that a coin join like transaction doesn't contain unexpected\n+  inputs that the wallet will then sign for unintentionally. (#22751)\n+\n+Updated REST APIs\n+-----------------\n+\n+- The `/headers/` and `/blockfilterheaders/` endpoints have been updated to use\n+  a query parameter instead of path parameter to specify the result count. The\n+  count parameter is now optional, and defaults to 5 for both endpoints. The old\n+  endpoints are still functional, and have no documented behaviour change.\n+\n+  For `/headers`, use\n+  `GET /rest/headers/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`\n+  instead of\n+  `GET /rest/headers/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)\n+\n+  For `/blockfilterheaders/`, use\n+  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`\n+  instead of\n+  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)\n+\n+  (#24098)\n+\n+Build System\n+------------\n+\n+- Guix builds are now reproducible across architectures (x86_64 & aarch64). (#21194)\n+\n+New settings\n+------------\n+\n+- A new `mempoolfullrbf` option has been added, which enables the mempool to\n+  accept transaction replacement without enforcing BIP125 replaceability\n+  signaling. (#25353)\n+\n+Wallet\n+------\n+\n+- The `-walletrbf` startup option will now default to `true`. The\n+  wallet will now default to opt-in RBF on transactions that it creates. (#25610)\n+\n+- The `replaceable` option for the `createrawtransaction` and\n+  `createpsbt` RPCs will now default to `true`. Transactions created\n+  with these RPCs will default to having opt-in RBF enabled. (#25610)\n+\n+- The `wsh()` output descriptor was extended with Miniscript support. You can import Miniscript\n+  descriptors for P2WSH in a watchonly wallet to track coins, but you can't spend from them using\n+  the Bitcoin Core wallet yet.\n+  You can find more about Miniscript on the [reference website](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/). (#24148)\n+\n+- To help prevent fingerprinting transactions created by the Bitcoin Core wallet, change output\n+  amounts are now randomized. (#24494)\n+\n+- The `listtransactions`, `gettransaction`, and `listsinceblock`\n+  RPC methods now include a wtxid field (hash of serialized transaction,\n+  including witness data) for each transaction. (#24198)\n+\n+- The `listsinceblock`, `listtransactions` and `gettransaction` output now contain a new\n+  `parent_descs` field for every \"receive\" entry. (#25504)\n+\n+- A new optional `include_change` parameter was added to the `listsinceblock` command.\n+\n+Migrating Legacy Wallets to Descriptor Wallets\n+---------------------------------------------\n+\n+An experimental RPC `migratewallet` has been added to migrate Legacy (non-descriptor) wallets to\n+Descriptor wallets. More information about the migration process is available in the\n+[documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/managing-wallets.md#migrating-legacy-wallets-to-descriptor-wallets).\n+\n+- RPC `getreceivedbylabel` now returns an error, \"Label not found\n+  in wallet\" (-4), if the label is not in the address book. (#25122)\n+\n+GUI changes\n+-----------\n+\n+- A new menu item to restore a wallet from a backup file has been added (#471).\n+\n+- Configuration changes made in the bitcoin GUI (such as the pruning setting,\n+proxy settings, UPNP preferences) are now saved to `<datadir>/settings.json`\n+file rather than to the Qt settings backend (windows registry or unix desktop\n+config files), so these settings will now apply to bitcoind, instead of being\n+ignored. (#15936)\n+\n+- Also, the interaction between GUI settings and `bitcoin.conf` settings is\n+simplified. Settings from `bitcoin.conf` are now displayed normally in the GUI\n+settings dialog, instead of in a separate warning message (\"Options set in this\n+dialog are overridden by the configuration file: -setting=value\"). And these\n+settings can now be edited because `settings.json` values take precedence over\n+`bitcoin.conf` values. (#15936)\n+\n+Low-level changes\n+=================\n+\n+RPC\n+---\n+\n+- The `deriveaddresses`, `getdescriptorinfo`, `importdescriptors` and `scantxoutset` commands now\n+  accept Miniscript expression within a `wsh()` descriptor. (#24148)\n+\n+- The `getaddressinfo`, `decodescript`, `listdescriptors` and `listunspent` commands may now output\n+  a Miniscript descriptor inside a `wsh()` where a `wsh(raw())` descriptor was previously returned.

This release includes a `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n+(allowing only opt-in RBF).\n+\n+Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\n+default for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\n+advocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\n+full-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\n+fees may rapidly become more reliable.\n+\n+Members of this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\n+not accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\n+to take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\n+when their assumptions do not hold.\n+\n+[Bitcoin Core 0.12.0]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\n+[bip125]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\n+  has been reworked.  This is particularly relevant for nodes starting up for the\n+  first time (or for nodes which are starting up after being offline for a long time).\n+\n+  Whenever headers are received from a peer that have a total chainwork that is either\n+  less than the node's `-minimumchainwork` value or is sufficiently below the work at\n+  the node's tip, a \"presync\" phase will begin, in which the node will download the\n+  peer's headers and verify the cumulative work on the peer's chain, prior to storing\n+  those headers permanently. Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,\n+  the headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.\n+\n+  This may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for\n+  the first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effect\n+  of a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node's best headers chain has less\n+  than `-minimumchainwork`), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanism\n+  with the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again). (#25717)\n+\n+- With I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outbound\n+  connection if `-i2pacceptincoming=0`. (#25355)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=softforks` configuration option has been removed.  The\n+  RPC `getblockchaininfo` no longer returns the `softforks` field, which was\n+  previously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status is\n+  now only available via the `getdeploymentinfo` RPC.\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase` configuration option has been removed.\n+  The `receivedby` RPCs (`listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`,\n+  `getreceivedbyaddress` and `getreceivedbylabel`) now always return results\n+  accounting for received coins from coinbase outputs, without an option to\n+  change that behaviour. Excluding coinbases was previously deprecated in 23.0.\n+  (#25171)\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=fees` configuration option has been removed. The top-level\n+  fee fields `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees` are no\n+  longer returned by RPCs `getmempoolentry`, `getrawmempool(verbose=true)`,\n+  `getmempoolancestors(verbose=true)` and `getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)`.\n+  The same fee fields can be accessed through the `fees` object in the result.\n+  The top-level fee fields were previously deprecated in 23.0. (#25204)\n+\n+- The `getpeerinfo` RPC has been updated with a new `presynced_headers` field,\n+  indicating the progress on the presync phase mentioned in the\n+  \"P2P and network changes\" section above.\n+\n+Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- The `sendall` RPC spends specific UTXOs to one or more recipients\n+  without creating change.

Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notice of new option for transaction replacement policies\n+=========================================================\n+\n+This version of Bitcoin Core adds a new `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option which allows users to change the policy their individual node\n+will use for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions.  The option\n+defaults to the same policy that was used in previous releases and no\n+changes to node policy will occur if everyone uses the default.\n+\n+Some Bitcoin services today expect that the first version of an\n+unconfirmed transaction that they see will be the version of the\n+transaction that ultimately gets confirmed---a transaction acceptance\n+policy sometimes called \"first-seen\".\n+\n+The Bitcoin Protocol does not, and cannot, provide any assurance that\n+the first version of an unconfirmed transaction seen by a particular\n+node will be the version that gets confirmed.  If there are multiple\n+versions of the same unconfirmed transaction available, only the miner\n+who includes one of those transactions in a block gets to decide which\n+version of the transaction gets confirmed.\n+\n+Despite this lack of assurance, multiple merchants and services today\n+still make this assumption.\n+\n+There are several benefits to users from removing this *first-seen*\n+simplification.  One key benefit, the ability for the sender of a\n+transaction to replace it with an alternative version paying higher\n+fees, was realized in [Bitcoin Core 0.12.0][] (February 2016) with the\n+introduction of [BIP125][] opt-in Replace By Fee (RBF).\n+\n+Since then, there has been discussion about completely removing the\n+first-seen simplification and allowing users to replace any of their\n+older unconfirmed transactions with newer transactions, a feature called\n+*full-RBF*.  This release includes a `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n+(allowing only opt-in RBF).\n+\n+Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\n+default for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\n+advocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\n+full-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\n+fees may rapidly become more reliable.\n+\n+Members of this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\n+not accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\n+to take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\n+when their assumptions do not hold.\n+\n+[Bitcoin Core 0.12.0]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\n+[bip125]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\n+  has been reworked.  This is particularly relevant for nodes starting up for the\n+  first time (or for nodes which are starting up after being offline for a long time).\n+\n+  Whenever headers are received from a peer that have a total chainwork that is either\n+  less than the node's `-minimumchainwork` value or is sufficiently below the work at\n+  the node's tip, a \"presync\" phase will begin, in which the node will download the\n+  peer's headers and verify the cumulative work on the peer's chain, prior to storing\n+  those headers permanently. Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,\n+  the headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.\n+\n+  This may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for\n+  the first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effect\n+  of a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node's best headers chain has less\n+  than `-minimumchainwork`), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanism\n+  with the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again). (#25717)\n+\n+- With I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outbound\n+  connection if `-i2pacceptincoming=0`. (#25355)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=softforks` configuration option has been removed.  The\n+  RPC `getblockchaininfo` no longer returns the `softforks` field, which was\n+  previously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status is\n+  now only available via the `getdeploymentinfo` RPC.\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase` configuration option has been removed.\n+  The `receivedby` RPCs (`listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`,\n+  `getreceivedbyaddress` and `getreceivedbylabel`) now always return results\n+  accounting for received coins from coinbase outputs, without an option to\n+  change that behaviour. Excluding coinbases was previously deprecated in 23.0.\n+  (#25171)\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=fees` configuration option has been removed. The top-level\n+  fee fields `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees` are no\n+  longer returned by RPCs `getmempoolentry`, `getrawmempool(verbose=true)`,\n+  `getmempoolancestors(verbose=true)` and `getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)`.\n+  The same fee fields can be accessed through the `fees` object in the result.\n+  The top-level fee fields were previously deprecated in 23.0. (#25204)\n+\n+- The `getpeerinfo` RPC has been updated with a new `presynced_headers` field,\n+  indicating the progress on the presync phase mentioned in the\n+  \"P2P and network changes\" section above.\n+\n+Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- The `sendall` RPC spends specific UTXOs to one or more recipients\n+  without creating change. By default, the `sendall` RPC will spend\n+  every UTXO in the wallet. `sendall` is useful to empty wallets or to\n+  create a changeless payment from select UTXOs. When creating a payment\n+  from a specific amount for which the recipient incurs the transaction\n+  fee, continue to use the `subtractfeefromamount` option via the\n+  `send`, `sendtoaddress`, or `sendmany` RPCs.

Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notice of new option for transaction replacement policies\n+=========================================================\n+\n+This version of Bitcoin Core adds a new `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option which allows users to change the policy their individual node\n+will use for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions.  The option\n+defaults to the same policy that was used in previous releases and no\n+changes to node policy will occur if everyone uses the default.\n+\n+Some Bitcoin services today expect that the first version of an\n+unconfirmed transaction that they see will be the version of the\n+transaction that ultimately gets confirmed---a transaction acceptance\n+policy sometimes called \"first-seen\".\n+\n+The Bitcoin Protocol does not, and cannot, provide any assurance that\n+the first version of an unconfirmed transaction seen by a particular\n+node will be the version that gets confirmed.  If there are multiple\n+versions of the same unconfirmed transaction available, only the miner\n+who includes one of those transactions in a block gets to decide which\n+version of the transaction gets confirmed.\n+\n+Despite this lack of assurance, multiple merchants and services today\n+still make this assumption.\n+\n+There are several benefits to users from removing this *first-seen*\n+simplification.  One key benefit, the ability for the sender of a\n+transaction to replace it with an alternative version paying higher\n+fees, was realized in [Bitcoin Core 0.12.0][] (February 2016) with the\n+introduction of [BIP125][] opt-in Replace By Fee (RBF).\n+\n+Since then, there has been discussion about completely removing the\n+first-seen simplification and allowing users to replace any of their\n+older unconfirmed transactions with newer transactions, a feature called\n+*full-RBF*.  This release includes a `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n+(allowing only opt-in RBF).\n+\n+Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\n+default for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\n+advocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\n+full-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\n+fees may rapidly become more reliable.\n+\n+Members of this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\n+not accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\n+to take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\n+when their assumptions do not hold.\n+\n+[Bitcoin Core 0.12.0]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\n+[bip125]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\n+  has been reworked.  This is particularly relevant for nodes starting up for the\n+  first time (or for nodes which are starting up after being offline for a long time).\n+\n+  Whenever headers are received from a peer that have a total chainwork that is either\n+  less than the node's `-minimumchainwork` value or is sufficiently below the work at\n+  the node's tip, a \"presync\" phase will begin, in which the node will download the\n+  peer's headers and verify the cumulative work on the peer's chain, prior to storing\n+  those headers permanently. Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,\n+  the headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.\n+\n+  This may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for\n+  the first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effect\n+  of a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node's best headers chain has less\n+  than `-minimumchainwork`), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanism\n+  with the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again). (#25717)\n+\n+- With I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outbound\n+  connection if `-i2pacceptincoming=0`. (#25355)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=softforks` configuration option has been removed.  The\n+  RPC `getblockchaininfo` no longer returns the `softforks` field, which was\n+  previously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status is\n+  now only available via the `getdeploymentinfo` RPC.\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase` configuration option has been removed.\n+  The `receivedby` RPCs (`listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`,\n+  `getreceivedbyaddress` and `getreceivedbylabel`) now always return results\n+  accounting for received coins from coinbase outputs, without an option to\n+  change that behaviour. Excluding coinbases was previously deprecated in 23.0.\n+  (#25171)\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=fees` configuration option has been removed. The top-level\n+  fee fields `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees` are no\n+  longer returned by RPCs `getmempoolentry`, `getrawmempool(verbose=true)`,\n+  `getmempoolancestors(verbose=true)` and `getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)`.\n+  The same fee fields can be accessed through the `fees` object in the result.\n+  The top-level fee fields were previously deprecated in 23.0. (#25204)\n+\n+- The `getpeerinfo` RPC has been updated with a new `presynced_headers` field,\n+  indicating the progress on the presync phase mentioned in the\n+  \"P2P and network changes\" section above.\n+\n+Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- The `sendall` RPC spends specific UTXOs to one or more recipients\n+  without creating change. By default, the `sendall` RPC will spend\n+  every UTXO in the wallet. `sendall` is useful to empty wallets or to\n+  create a changeless payment from select UTXOs. When creating a payment\n+  from a specific amount for which the recipient incurs the transaction\n+  fee, continue to use the `subtractfeefromamount` option via the\n+  `send`, `sendtoaddress`, or `sendmany` RPCs. (#24118)\n+\n+- A new `gettxspendingprevout` RPC has been added, which scans the mempool to find\n+  transactions spending any of the given outpoints. (#24408)\n+\n+- The `simulaterawtransaction` RPC iterates over the inputs and outputs of the given\n+  transactions, and tallies up the balance change for the given wallet. This can be\n+  useful e.g. when verifying that a coin join like transaction doesn't contain unexpected\n+  inputs that the wallet will then sign for unintentionally. (#22751)\n+\n+Updated REST APIs\n+-----------------\n+\n+- The `/headers/` and `/blockfilterheaders/` endpoints have been updated to use\n+  a query parameter instead of path parameter to specify the result count. The\n+  count parameter is now optional, and defaults to 5 for both endpoints. The old\n+  endpoints are still functional, and have no documented behaviour change.\n+\n+  For `/headers`, use\n+  `GET /rest/headers/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`\n+  instead of\n+  `GET /rest/headers/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)\n+\n+  For `/blockfilterheaders/`, use\n+  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`\n+  instead of\n+  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)\n+\n+  (#24098)\n+\n+Build System\n+------------\n+\n+- Guix builds are now reproducible across architectures (x86_64 & aarch64). (#21194)\n+\n+New settings\n+------------\n+\n+- A new `mempoolfullrbf` option has been added, which enables the mempool to\n+  accept transaction replacement without enforcing BIP125 replaceability\n+  signaling. (#25353)\n+\n+Wallet\n+------\n+\n+- The `-walletrbf` startup option will now default to `true`. The\n+  wallet will now default to opt-in RBF on transactions that it creates. (#25610)\n+\n+- The `replaceable` option for the `createrawtransaction` and\n+  `createpsbt` RPCs will now default to `true`. Transactions created\n+  with these RPCs will default to having opt-in RBF enabled. (#25610)\n+\n+- The `wsh()` output descriptor was extended with Miniscript support. You can import Miniscript\n+  descriptors for P2WSH in a watchonly wallet to track coins, but you can't spend from them using\n+  the Bitcoin Core wallet yet.\n+  You can find more about Miniscript on the [reference website](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/). (#24148)\n+\n+- To help prevent fingerprinting transactions created by the Bitcoin Core wallet, change output\n+  amounts are now randomized. (#24494)\n+\n+- The `listtransactions`, `gettransaction`, and `listsinceblock`\n+  RPC methods now include a wtxid field (hash of serialized transaction,\n+  including witness data) for each transaction. (#24198)\n+\n+- The `listsinceblock`, `listtransactions` and `gettransaction` output now contain a new\n+  `parent_descs` field for every \"receive\" entry. (#25504)\n+\n+- A new optional `include_change` parameter was added to the `listsinceblock` command.\n+\n+Migrating Legacy Wallets to Descriptor Wallets\n+---------------------------------------------\n+\n+An experimental RPC `migratewallet` has been added to migrate Legacy (non-descriptor) wallets to\n+Descriptor wallets. More information about the migration process is available in the\n+[documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/managing-wallets.md#migrating-legacy-wallets-to-descriptor-wallets).\n+\n+- RPC `getreceivedbylabel` now returns an error, \"Label not found\n+  in wallet\" (-4), if the label is not in the address book.

This release includes a `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n+(allowing only opt-in RBF).\n+\n+Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\n+default for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\n+advocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\n+full-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\n+fees may rapidly become more reliable.\n+\n+Members of this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\n+not accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\n+to take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\n+when their assumptions do not hold.\n+\n+[Bitcoin Core 0.12.0]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\n+[bip125]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\n+  has been reworked.  This is particularly relevant for nodes starting up for the\n+  first time (or for nodes which are starting up after being offline for a long time).\n+\n+  Whenever headers are received from a peer that have a total chainwork that is either\n+  less than the node's `-minimumchainwork` value or is sufficiently below the work at\n+  the node's tip, a \"presync\" phase will begin, in which the node will download the\n+  peer's headers and verify the cumulative work on the peer's chain, prior to storing\n+  those headers permanently. Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,\n+  the headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.\n+\n+  This may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for\n+  the first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effect\n+  of a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node's best headers chain has less\n+  than `-minimumchainwork`), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanism\n+  with the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again). (#25717)\n+\n+- With I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outbound\n+  connection if `-i2pacceptincoming=0`. (#25355)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=softforks` configuration option has been removed.  The\n+  RPC `getblockchaininfo` no longer returns the `softforks` field, which was\n+  previously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status is\n+  now only available via the `getdeploymentinfo` RPC.\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase` configuration option has been removed.\n+  The `receivedby` RPCs (`listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`,\n+  `getreceivedbyaddress` and `getreceivedbylabel`) now always return results\n+  accounting for received coins from coinbase outputs, without an option to\n+  change that behaviour. Excluding coinbases was previously deprecated in 23.0.\n+  (#25171)\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=fees` configuration option has been removed. The top-level\n+  fee fields `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees` are no\n+  longer returned by RPCs `getmempoolentry`, `getrawmempool(verbose=true)`,\n+  `getmempoolancestors(verbose=true)` and `getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)`.\n+  The same fee fields can be accessed through the `fees` object in the result.\n+  The top-level fee fields were previously deprecated in 23.0. (#25204)\n+\n+- The `getpeerinfo` RPC has been updated with a new `presynced_headers` field,\n+  indicating the progress on the presync phase mentioned in the\n+  \"P2P and network changes\" section above.\n+\n+Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- The `sendall` RPC spends specific UTXOs to one or more recipients\n+  without creating change. By default, the `sendall` RPC will spend\n+  every UTXO in the wallet. `sendall` is useful to empty wallets or to\n+  create a changeless payment from select UTXOs. When creating a payment\n+  from a specific amount for which the recipient incurs the transaction\n+  fee, continue to use the `subtractfeefromamount` option via the\n+  `send`, `sendtoaddress`, or `sendmany` RPCs. (#24118)\n+\n+- A new `gettxspendingprevout` RPC has been added, which scans the mempool to find\n+  transactions spending any of the given outpoints. (#24408)\n+\n+- The `simulaterawtransaction` RPC iterates over the inputs and outputs of the given\n+  transactions, and tallies up the balance change for the given wallet. This can be\n+  useful e.g. when verifying that a coin join like transaction doesn't contain unexpected\n+  inputs that the wallet will then sign for unintentionally. (#22751)\n+\n+Updated REST APIs\n+-----------------\n+\n+- The `/headers/` and `/blockfilterheaders/` endpoints have been updated to use\n+  a query parameter instead of path parameter to specify the result count. The\n+  count parameter is now optional, and defaults to 5 for both endpoints. The old\n+  endpoints are still functional, and have no documented behaviour change.\n+\n+  For `/headers`, use\n+  `GET /rest/headers/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`\n+  instead of\n+  `GET /rest/headers/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)\n+\n+  For `/blockfilterheaders/`, use\n+  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`\n+  instead of\n+  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)\n+\n+  (#24098)\n+\n+Build System\n+------------\n+\n+- Guix builds are now reproducible across architectures (x86_64 & aarch64). (#21194)\n+\n+New settings\n+------------\n+\n+- A new `mempoolfullrbf` option has been added, which enables the mempool to\n+  accept transaction replacement without enforcing BIP125 replaceability\n+  signaling. (#25353)\n+\n+Wallet\n+------\n+\n+- The `-walletrbf` startup option will now default to `true`. The\n+  wallet will now default to opt-in RBF on transactions that it creates. (#25610)\n+\n+- The `replaceable` option for the `createrawtransaction` and\n+  `createpsbt` RPCs will now default to `true`. Transactions created\n+  with these RPCs will default to having opt-in RBF enabled. (#25610)\n+\n+- The `wsh()` output descriptor was extended with Miniscript support. You can import Miniscript\n+  descriptors for P2WSH in a watchonly wallet to track coins, but you can't spend from them using\n+  the Bitcoin Core wallet yet.\n+  You can find more about Miniscript on the [reference website](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/). (#24148)\n+\n+- To help prevent fingerprinting transactions created by the Bitcoin Core wallet, change output\n+  amounts are now randomized. (#24494)\n+\n+- The `listtransactions`, `gettransaction`, and `listsinceblock`\n+  RPC methods now include a wtxid field (hash of serialized transaction,\n+  including witness data) for each transaction. (#24198)\n+\n+- The `listsinceblock`, `listtransactions` and `gettransaction` output now contain a new\n+  `parent_descs` field for every \"receive\" entry. (#25504)\n+\n+- A new optional `include_change` parameter was added to the `listsinceblock` command.\n+\n+Migrating Legacy Wallets to Descriptor Wallets\n+---------------------------------------------\n+\n+An experimental RPC `migratewallet` has been added to migrate Legacy (non-descriptor) wallets to\n+Descriptor wallets. More information about the migration process is available in the\n+[documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/managing-wallets.md#migrating-legacy-wallets-to-descriptor-wallets).\n+\n+- RPC `getreceivedbylabel` now returns an error, \"Label not found\n+  in wallet\" (-4), if the label is not in the address book.

Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notice of new option for transaction replacement policies\n+=========================================================\n+\n+This version of Bitcoin Core adds a new `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option which allows users to change the policy their individual node\n+will use for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions.  The option\n+defaults to the same policy that was used in previous releases and no\n+changes to node policy will occur if everyone uses the default.\n+\n+Some Bitcoin services today expect that the first version of an\n+unconfirmed transaction that they see will be the version of the\n+transaction that ultimately gets confirmed---a transaction acceptance\n+policy sometimes called \"first-seen\".\n+\n+The Bitcoin Protocol does not, and cannot, provide any assurance that\n+the first version of an unconfirmed transaction seen by a particular\n+node will be the version that gets confirmed.  If there are multiple\n+versions of the same unconfirmed transaction available, only the miner\n+who includes one of those transactions in a block gets to decide which\n+version of the transaction gets confirmed.\n+\n+Despite this lack of assurance, multiple merchants and services today\n+still make this assumption.\n+\n+There are several benefits to users from removing this *first-seen*\n+simplification.  One key benefit, the ability for the sender of a\n+transaction to replace it with an alternative version paying higher\n+fees, was realized in [Bitcoin Core 0.12.0][] (February 2016) with the\n+introduction of [BIP125][] opt-in Replace By Fee (RBF).\n+\n+Since then, there has been discussion about completely removing the\n+first-seen simplification and allowing users to replace any of their\n+older unconfirmed transactions with newer transactions, a feature called\n+*full-RBF*.  This release includes a `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n+(allowing only opt-in RBF).\n+\n+Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\n+default for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\n+advocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\n+full-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\n+fees may rapidly become more reliable.\n+\n+Members of this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\n+not accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\n+to take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\n+when their assumptions do not hold.\n+\n+[Bitcoin Core 0.12.0]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\n+[bip125]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\n+  has been reworked.  This is particularly relevant for nodes starting up for the\n+  first time (or for nodes which are starting up after being offline for a long time).\n+\n+  Whenever headers are received from a peer that have a total chainwork that is either\n+  less than the node's `-minimumchainwork` value or is sufficiently below the work at\n+  the node's tip, a \"presync\" phase will begin, in which the node will download the\n+  peer's headers and verify the cumulative work on the peer's chain, prior to storing\n+  those headers permanently. Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,\n+  the headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.\n+\n+  This may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for\n+  the first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effect\n+  of a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node's best headers chain has less\n+  than `-minimumchainwork`), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanism\n+  with the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again). (#25717)\n+\n+- With I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outbound\n+  connection if `-i2pacceptincoming=0`. (#25355)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=softforks` configuration option has been removed.  The\n+  RPC `getblockchaininfo` no longer returns the `softforks` field, which was\n+  previously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status is\n+  now only available via the `getdeploymentinfo` RPC.\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase` configuration option has been removed.\n+  The `receivedby` RPCs (`listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`,\n+  `getreceivedbyaddress` and `getreceivedbylabel`) now always return results\n+  accounting for received coins from coinbase outputs, without an option to\n+  change that behaviour. Excluding coinbases was previously deprecated in 23.0.\n+  (#25171)\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=fees` configuration option has been removed. The top-level\n+  fee fields `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees` are no\n+  longer returned by RPCs `getmempoolentry`, `getrawmempool(verbose=true)`,\n+  `getmempoolancestors(verbose=true)` and `getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)`.\n+  The same fee fields can be accessed through the `fees` object in the result.\n+  The top-level fee fields were previously deprecated in 23.0. (#25204)\n+\n+- The `getpeerinfo` RPC has been updated with a new `presynced_headers` field,\n+  indicating the progress on the presync phase mentioned in the\n+  \"P2P and network changes\" section above.\n+\n+Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- The `sendall` RPC spends specific UTXOs to one or more recipients\n+  without creating change. By default, the `sendall` RPC will spend\n+  every UTXO in the wallet. `sendall` is useful to empty wallets or to\n+  create a changeless payment from select UTXOs. When creating a payment\n+  from a specific amount for which the recipient incurs the transaction\n+  fee, continue to use the `subtractfeefromamount` option via the\n+  `send`, `sendtoaddress`, or `sendmany` RPCs. (#24118)\n+\n+- A new `gettxspendingprevout` RPC has been added, which scans the mempool to find\n+  transactions spending any of the given outpoints. (#24408)\n+\n+- The `simulaterawtransaction` RPC iterates over the inputs and outputs of the given\n+  transactions, and tallies up the balance change for the given wallet. This can be\n+  useful e.g. when verifying that a coin join like transaction doesn't contain unexpected\n+  inputs that the wallet will then sign for unintentionally. (#22751)\n+\n+Updated REST APIs\n+-----------------\n+\n+- The `/headers/` and `/blockfilterheaders/` endpoints have been updated to use\n+  a query parameter instead of path parameter to specify the result count. The\n+  count parameter is now optional, and defaults to 5 for both endpoints. The old\n+  endpoints are still functional, and have no documented behaviour change.\n+\n+  For `/headers`, use\n+  `GET /rest/headers/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`\n+  instead of\n+  `GET /rest/headers/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)\n+\n+  For `/blockfilterheaders/`, use\n+  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`\n+  instead of\n+  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)\n+\n+  (#24098)\n+\n+Build System\n+------------\n+\n+- Guix builds are now reproducible across architectures (x86_64 & aarch64). (#21194)\n+\n+New settings\n+------------\n+\n+- A new `mempoolfullrbf` option has been added, which enables the mempool to\n+  accept transaction replacement without enforcing BIP125 replaceability\n+  signaling. (#25353)\n+\n+Wallet\n+------\n+\n+- The `-walletrbf` startup option will now default to `true`. The\n+  wallet will now default to opt-in RBF on transactions that it creates. (#25610)\n+\n+- The `replaceable` option for the `createrawtransaction` and\n+  `createpsbt` RPCs will now default to `true`. Transactions created\n+  with these RPCs will default to having opt-in RBF enabled. (#25610)\n+\n+- The `wsh()` output descriptor was extended with Miniscript support. You can import Miniscript\n+  descriptors for P2WSH in a watchonly wallet to track coins, but you can't spend from them using\n+  the Bitcoin Core wallet yet.\n+  You can find more about Miniscript on the [reference website](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/). (#24148)\n+\n+- To help prevent fingerprinting transactions created by the Bitcoin Core wallet, change output\n+  amounts are now randomized. (#24494)\n+\n+- The `listtransactions`, `gettransaction`, and `listsinceblock`\n+  RPC methods now include a wtxid field (hash of serialized transaction,\n+  including witness data) for each transaction. (#24198)\n+\n+- The `listsinceblock`, `listtransactions` and `gettransaction` output now contain a new\n+  `parent_descs` field for every \"receive\" entry. (#25504)\n+\n+- A new optional `include_change` parameter was added to the `listsinceblock` command.\n+\n+- RPC `getreceivedbylabel` now returns an error, \"Label not found\n+  in wallet\" (-4), if the label is not in the address book. (#25122)\n+\n+Migrating Legacy Wallets to Descriptor Wallets\n+---------------------------------------------\n+\n+An experimental RPC `migratewallet` has been added to migrate Legacy (non-descriptor) wallets to\n+Descriptor wallets. More information about the migration process is available in the\n+[documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/managing-wallets.md#migrating-legacy-wallets-to-descriptor-wallets).\n+\n+GUI changes\n+-----------\n+\n+- A new menu item to restore a wallet from a backup file has been added (#471).",

Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notice of new option for transaction replacement policies\n+=========================================================\n+\n+This version of Bitcoin Core adds a new `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option which allows users to change the policy their individual node\n+will use for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions.  The option\n+defaults to the same policy that was used in previous releases and no\n+changes to node policy will occur if everyone uses the default.\n+\n+Some Bitcoin services today expect that the first version of an\n+unconfirmed transaction that they see will be the version of the\n+transaction that ultimately gets confirmed---a transaction acceptance\n+policy sometimes called \"first-seen\".\n+\n+The Bitcoin Protocol does not, and cannot, provide any assurance that\n+the first version of an unconfirmed transaction seen by a particular\n+node will be the version that gets confirmed.  If there are multiple\n+versions of the same unconfirmed transaction available, only the miner\n+who includes one of those transactions in a block gets to decide which\n+version of the transaction gets confirmed.\n+\n+Despite this lack of assurance, multiple merchants and services today\n+still make this assumption.\n+\n+There are several benefits to users from removing this *first-seen*\n+simplification.  One key benefit, the ability for the sender of a\n+transaction to replace it with an alternative version paying higher\n+fees, was realized in [Bitcoin Core 0.12.0][] (February 2016) with the\n+introduction of [BIP125][] opt-in Replace By Fee (RBF).\n+\n+Since then, there has been discussion about completely removing the\n+first-seen simplification and allowing users to replace any of their\n+older unconfirmed transactions with newer transactions, a feature called\n+*full-RBF*.  This release includes a `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n+(allowing only opt-in RBF).\n+\n+Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\n+default for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\n+advocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\n+full-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\n+fees may rapidly become more reliable.\n+\n+Members of this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\n+not accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\n+to take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\n+when their assumptions do not hold.\n+\n+[Bitcoin Core 0.12.0]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\n+[bip125]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\n+  has been reworked.  This is particularly relevant for nodes starting up for the\n+  first time (or for nodes which are starting up after being offline for a long time).\n+\n+  Whenever headers are received from a peer that have a total chainwork that is either\n+  less than the node's `-minimumchainwork` value or is sufficiently below the work at\n+  the node's tip, a \"presync\" phase will begin, in which the node will download the\n+  peer's headers and verify the cumulative work on the peer's chain, prior to storing\n+  those headers permanently. Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,\n+  the headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.\n+\n+  This may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for\n+  the first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effect\n+  of a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node's best headers chain has less\n+  than `-minimumchainwork`), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanism\n+  with the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again). (#25717)\n+\n+- With I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outbound\n+  connection if `-i2pacceptincoming=0`. (#25355)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=softforks` configuration option has been removed.  The\n+  RPC `getblockchaininfo` no longer returns the `softforks` field, which was\n+  previously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status is\n+  now only available via the `getdeploymentinfo` RPC.\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase` configuration option has been removed.\n+  The `receivedby` RPCs (`listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`,\n+  `getreceivedbyaddress` and `getreceivedbylabel`) now always return results\n+  accounting for received coins from coinbase outputs, without an option to\n+  change that behaviour. Excluding coinbases was previously deprecated in 23.0.\n+  (#25171)\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=fees` configuration option has been removed. The top-level\n+  fee fields `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees` are no\n+  longer returned by RPCs `getmempoolentry`, `getrawmempool(verbose=true)`,\n+  `getmempoolancestors(verbose=true)` and `getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)`.\n+  The same fee fields can be accessed through the `fees` object in the result.\n+  The top-level fee fields were previously deprecated in 23.0. (#25204)\n+\n+- The `getpeerinfo` RPC has been updated with a new `presynced_headers` field,\n+  indicating the progress on the presync phase mentioned in the\n+  \"P2P and network changes\" section above.\n+\n+Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- The `sendall` RPC spends specific UTXOs to one or more recipients\n+  without creating change. By default, the `sendall` RPC will spend\n+  every UTXO in the wallet. `sendall` is useful to empty wallets or to\n+  create a changeless payment from select UTXOs. When creating a payment\n+  from a specific amount for which the recipient incurs the transaction\n+  fee, continue to use the `subtractfeefromamount` option via the\n+  `send`, `sendtoaddress`, or `sendmany` RPCs. (#24118)\n+\n+- A new `gettxspendingprevout` RPC has been added, which scans the mempool to find\n+  transactions spending any of the given outpoints. (#24408)\n+\n+- The `simulaterawtransaction` RPC iterates over the inputs and outputs of the given\n+  transactions, and tallies up the balance change for the given wallet. This can be\n+  useful e.g. when verifying that a coin join like transaction doesn't contain unexpected\n+  inputs that the wallet will then sign for unintentionally. (#22751)\n+\n+Updated REST APIs\n+-----------------\n+\n+- The `/headers/` and `/blockfilterheaders/` endpoints have been updated to use\n+  a query parameter instead of path parameter to specify the result count. The\n+  count parameter is now optional, and defaults to 5 for both endpoints. The old\n+  endpoints are still functional, and have no documented behaviour change.\n+\n+  For `/headers`, use\n+  `GET /rest/headers/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`\n+  instead of\n+  `GET /rest/headers/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)\n+\n+  For `/blockfilterheaders/`, use\n+  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`\n+  instead of\n+  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)\n+\n+  (#24098)\n+\n+Build System\n+------------\n+\n+- Guix builds are now reproducible across architectures (x86_64 & aarch64). (#21194)\n+\n+New settings\n+------------\n+\n+- A new `mempoolfullrbf` option has been added, which enables the mempool to\n+  accept transaction replacement without enforcing BIP125 replaceability\n+  signaling. (#25353)\n+\n+Wallet\n+------\n+\n+- The `-walletrbf` startup option will now default to `true`. The\n+  wallet will now default to opt-in RBF on transactions that it creates. (#25610)\n+\n+- The `replaceable` option for the `createrawtransaction` and\n+  `createpsbt` RPCs will now default to `true`. Transactions created\n+  with these RPCs will default to having opt-in RBF enabled. (#25610)\n+\n+- The `wsh()` output descriptor was extended with Miniscript support. You can import Miniscript\n+  descriptors for P2WSH in a watchonly wallet to track coins, but you can't spend from them using\n+  the Bitcoin Core wallet yet.\n+  You can find more about Miniscript on the [reference website](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/). (#24148)\n+\n+- To help prevent fingerprinting transactions created by the Bitcoin Core wallet, change output\n+  amounts are now randomized. (#24494)\n+\n+- The `listtransactions`, `gettransaction`, and `listsinceblock`\n+  RPC methods now include a wtxid field (hash of serialized transaction,\n+  including witness data) for each transaction. (#24198)\n+\n+- The `listsinceblock`, `listtransactions` and `gettransaction` output now contain a new\n+  `parent_descs` field for every \"receive\" entry. (#25504)\n+\n+- A new optional `include_change` parameter was added to the `listsinceblock` command.\n+\n+- RPC `getreceivedbylabel` now returns an error, \"Label not found\n+  in wallet\" (-4), if the label is not in the address book. (#25122)\n+\n+Migrating Legacy Wallets to Descriptor Wallets\n+---------------------------------------------\n+\n+An experimental RPC `migratewallet` has been added to migrate Legacy (non-descriptor) wallets to\n+Descriptor wallets. More information about the migration process is available in the\n+[documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/managing-wallets.md#migrating-legacy-wallets-to-descriptor-wallets).\n+\n+GUI changes\n+-----------\n+\n+- A new menu item to restore a wallet from a backup file has been added (#471).\n+\n+- Configuration changes made in the bitcoin GUI (such as the pruning setting,\n+proxy settings, UPNP preferences) are now saved to `<datadir>/settings.json`\n+file rather than to the Qt settings backend (windows registry or unix desktop\n+config files), so these settings will now apply to bitcoind, instead of being\n+ignored.

Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,\n+  the headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.\n+\n+  This may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for\n+  the first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effect\n+  of a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node's best headers chain has less\n+  than `-minimumchainwork`), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanism\n+  with the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again).

Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notice of new option for transaction replacement policies\n+=========================================================\n+\n+This version of Bitcoin Core adds a new `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option which allows users to change the policy their individual node\n+will use for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions.  The option\n+defaults to the same policy that was used in previous releases and no\n+changes to node policy will occur if everyone uses the default.\n+\n+Some Bitcoin services today expect that the first version of an\n+unconfirmed transaction that they see will be the version of the\n+transaction that ultimately gets confirmed---a transaction acceptance\n+policy sometimes called \"first-seen\".\n+\n+The Bitcoin Protocol does not, and cannot, provide any assurance that\n+the first version of an unconfirmed transaction seen by a particular\n+node will be the version that gets confirmed.  If there are multiple\n+versions of the same unconfirmed transaction available, only the miner\n+who includes one of those transactions in a block gets to decide which\n+version of the transaction gets confirmed.\n+\n+Despite this lack of assurance, multiple merchants and services today\n+still make this assumption.\n+\n+There are several benefits to users from removing this *first-seen*\n+simplification.  One key benefit, the ability for the sender of a\n+transaction to replace it with an alternative version paying higher\n+fees, was realized in [Bitcoin Core 0.12.0][] (February 2016) with the\n+introduction of [BIP125][] opt-in Replace By Fee (RBF).\n+\n+Since then, there has been discussion about completely removing the\n+first-seen simplification and allowing users to replace any of their\n+older unconfirmed transactions with newer transactions, a feature called\n+*full-RBF*.  This release includes a `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n+(allowing only opt-in RBF).\n+\n+Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\n+default for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\n+advocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\n+full-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\n+fees may rapidly become more reliable.\n+\n+Members of this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\n+not accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\n+to take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\n+when their assumptions do not hold.\n+\n+[Bitcoin Core 0.12.0]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\n+[bip125]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\n+  has been reworked.

Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notice of new option for transaction replacement policies\n+=========================================================\n+\n+This version of Bitcoin Core adds a new `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option which allows users to change the policy their individual node\n+will use for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions.  The option\n+defaults to the same policy that was used in previous releases and no\n+changes to node policy will occur if everyone uses the default.\n+\n+Some Bitcoin services today expect that the first version of an\n+unconfirmed transaction that they see will be the version of the\n+transaction that ultimately gets confirmed---a transaction acceptance\n+policy sometimes called \"first-seen\".\n+\n+The Bitcoin Protocol does not, and cannot, provide any assurance that\n+the first version of an unconfirmed transaction seen by a particular\n+node will be the version that gets confirmed.  If there are multiple\n+versions of the same unconfirmed transaction available, only the miner\n+who includes one of those transactions in a block gets to decide which\n+version of the transaction gets confirmed.\n+\n+Despite this lack of assurance, multiple merchants and services today\n+still make this assumption.\n+\n+There are several benefits to users from removing this *first-seen*\n+simplification.  One key benefit, the ability for the sender of a\n+transaction to replace it with an alternative version paying higher\n+fees, was realized in [Bitcoin Core 0.12.0][] (February 2016) with the\n+introduction of [BIP125][] opt-in Replace By Fee (RBF).\n+\n+Since then, there has been discussion about completely removing the\n+first-seen simplification and allowing users to replace any of their\n+older unconfirmed transactions with newer transactions, a feature called\n+*full-RBF*.  This release includes a `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n+(allowing only opt-in RBF).\n+\n+Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\n+default for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\n+advocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\n+full-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\n+fees may rapidly become more reliable.\n+\n+Members of this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\n+not accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\n+to take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\n+when their assumptions do not hold.\n+\n+[Bitcoin Core 0.12.0]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\n+[bip125]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\n+  has been reworked.

Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.

It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notice of new option for transaction replacement policies\n+=========================================================\n+\n+This version of Bitcoin Core adds a new `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option which allows users to change the policy their individual node\n+will use for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions.  The option\n+defaults to the same policy that was used in previous releases and no\n+changes to node policy will occur if everyone uses the default.\n+\n+Some Bitcoin services today expect that the first version of an\n+unconfirmed transaction that they see will be the version of the\n+transaction that ultimately gets confirmed---a transaction acceptance\n+policy sometimes called \"first-seen\".\n+\n+The Bitcoin Protocol does not, and cannot, provide any assurance that\n+the first version of an unconfirmed transaction seen by a particular\n+node will be the version that gets confirmed.  If there are multiple\n+versions of the same unconfirmed transaction available, only the miner\n+who includes one of those transactions in a block gets to decide which\n+version of the transaction gets confirmed.\n+\n+Despite this lack of assurance, multiple merchants and services today\n+still make this assumption.\n+\n+There are several benefits to users from removing this *first-seen*\n+simplification.  One key benefit, the ability for the sender of a\n+transaction to replace it with an alternative version paying higher\n+fees, was realized in [Bitcoin Core 0.12.0][] (February 2016) with the\n+introduction of [BIP125][] opt-in Replace By Fee (RBF).\n+\n+Since then, there has been discussion about completely removing the\n+first-seen simplification and allowing users to replace any of their\n+older unconfirmed transactions with newer transactions, a feature called\n+*full-RBF*.  This release includes a `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n+(allowing only opt-in RBF).\n+\n+Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\n+default for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\n+advocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\n+full-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\n+fees may rapidly become more reliable.\n+\n+Members of this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\n+not accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\n+to take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\n+when their assumptions do not hold.\n+\n+[Bitcoin Core 0.12.0]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\n+[bip125]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\n+  has been reworked.

Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notice of new option for transaction replacement policies\n+=========================================================\n+\n+This version of Bitcoin Core adds a new `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option which allows users to change the policy their individual node\n+will use for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions.  The option\n+defaults to the same policy that was used in previous releases and no\n+changes to node policy will occur if everyone uses the default.\n+\n+Some Bitcoin services today expect that the first version of an\n+unconfirmed transaction that they see will be the version of the\n+transaction that ultimately gets confirmed---a transaction acceptance\n+policy sometimes called \"first-seen\".\n+\n+The Bitcoin Protocol does not, and cannot, provide any assurance that\n+the first version of an unconfirmed transaction seen by a particular\n+node will be the version that gets confirmed.  If there are multiple\n+versions of the same unconfirmed transaction available, only the miner\n+who includes one of those transactions in a block gets to decide which\n+version of the transaction gets confirmed.\n+\n+Despite this lack of assurance, multiple merchants and services today\n+still make this assumption.\n+\n+There are several benefits to users from removing this *first-seen*\n+simplification.  One key benefit, the ability for the sender of a\n+transaction to replace it with an alternative version paying higher\n+fees, was realized in [Bitcoin Core 0.12.0][] (February 2016) with the\n+introduction of [BIP125][] opt-in Replace By Fee (RBF).\n+\n+Since then, there has been discussion about completely removing the\n+first-seen simplification and allowing users to replace any of their\n+older unconfirmed transactions with newer transactions, a feature called\n+*full-RBF*.  This release includes a `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n+(allowing only opt-in RBF).\n+\n+Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\n+default for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\n+advocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\n+full-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\n+fees may rapidly become more reliable.\n+\n+Members of this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\n+not accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\n+to take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\n+when their assumptions do not hold.\n+\n+[Bitcoin Core 0.12.0]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\n+[bip125]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\n+  has been reworked.

(#25717)\n+\n+- With I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outbound\n+  connection if `-i2pacceptincoming=0`. (#25355)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=softforks` configuration option has been removed.  The\n+  RPC `getblockchaininfo` no longer returns the `softforks` field, which was\n+  previously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status is\n+  now only available via the `getdeploymentinfo` RPC.\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase` configuration option has been removed.\n+  The `receivedby` RPCs (`listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`,\n+  `getreceivedbyaddress` and `getreceivedbylabel`) now always return results\n+  accounting for received coins from coinbase outputs, without an option to\n+  change that behaviour.

(#25204)\n+\n+- The `getpeerinfo` RPC has been updated with a new `presynced_headers` field,\n+  indicating the progress on the presync phase mentioned in the\n+  \"P2P and network changes\" section above.\n+\n+Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- The `sendall` RPC spends specific UTXOs to one or more recipients\n+  without creating change. By default, the `sendall` RPC will spend\n+  every UTXO in the wallet. `sendall` is useful to empty wallets or to\n+  create a changeless payment from select UTXOs. When creating a payment\n+  from a specific amount for which the recipient incurs the transaction\n+  fee, continue to use the `subtractfeefromamount` option via the\n+  `send`, `sendtoaddress`, or `sendmany` RPCs. (#24118)\n+\n+- A new `gettxspendingprevout` RPC has been added, which scans the mempool to find\n+  transactions spending any of the given outpoints. (#24408)\n+\n+- The `simulaterawtransaction` RPC iterates over the inputs and outputs of the given\n+  transactions, and tallies up the balance change for the given wallet. This can be\n+  useful e.g. when verifying that a coin join like transaction doesn't contain unexpected\n+  inputs that the wallet will then sign for unintentionally. (#22751)\n+\n+Updated REST APIs\n+-----------------\n+\n+- The `/headers/` and `/blockfilterheaders/` endpoints have been updated to use\n+  a query parameter instead of path parameter to specify the result count. The\n+  count parameter is now optional, and defaults to 5 for both endpoints. The old\n+  endpoints are still functional, and have no documented behaviour change.\n+\n+  For `/headers`, use\n+  `GET /rest/headers/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`\n+  instead of\n+  `GET /rest/headers/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)\n+\n+  For `/blockfilterheaders/`, use\n+  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`\n+  instead of\n+  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)\n+\n+  (#24098)\n+\n+Build System\n+------------\n+\n+- Guix builds are now reproducible across architectures (x86_64 & aarch64). (#21194)\n+\n+New settings\n+------------\n+\n+- A new `mempoolfullrbf` option has been added, which enables the mempool to\n+  accept transaction replacement without enforcing BIP125 replaceability\n+  signaling. (#25353)\n+\n+Wallet\n+------\n+\n+- The `-walletrbf` startup option will now default to `true`. The\n+  wallet will now default to opt-in RBF on transactions that it creates. (#25610)\n+\n+- The `replaceable` option for the `createrawtransaction` and\n+  `createpsbt` RPCs will now default to `true`. Transactions created\n+  with these RPCs will default to having opt-in RBF enabled. (#25610)\n+\n+- The `wsh()` output descriptor was extended with Miniscript support. You can import Miniscript\n+  descriptors for P2WSH in a watchonly wallet to track coins, but you can't spend from them using\n+  the Bitcoin Core wallet yet.\n+  You can find more about Miniscript on the [reference website](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/). (#24148)\n+\n+- The `tr()` output descriptor now supports multisig scripts through the `multi_a()` and\n+  `sortedmulti_a()` functions. (#24043)\n+\n+- To help prevent fingerprinting transactions created by the Bitcoin Core wallet, change output\n+  amounts are now randomized. (#24494)\n+\n+- The `listtransactions`, `gettransaction`, and `listsinceblock`\n+  RPC methods now include a wtxid field (hash of serialized transaction,\n+  including witness data) for each transaction. (#24198)\n+\n+- The `listsinceblock`, `listtransactions` and `gettransaction` output now contain a new",

Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notice of new option for transaction replacement policies\n+=========================================================\n+\n+This version of Bitcoin Core adds a new `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option which allows users to change the policy their individual node\n+will use for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions.  The option\n+defaults to the same policy that was used in previous releases and no\n+changes to node policy will occur if everyone uses the default.\n+\n+Some Bitcoin services today expect that the first version of an\n+unconfirmed transaction that they see will be the version of the\n+transaction that ultimately gets confirmed---a transaction acceptance\n+policy sometimes called \"first-seen\".\n+\n+The Bitcoin Protocol does not, and cannot, provide any assurance that\n+the first version of an unconfirmed transaction seen by a particular\n+node will be the version that gets confirmed.  If there are multiple\n+versions of the same unconfirmed transaction available, only the miner\n+who includes one of those transactions in a block gets to decide which\n+version of the transaction gets confirmed.\n+\n+Despite this lack of assurance, multiple merchants and services today\n+still make this assumption.\n+\n+There are several benefits to users from removing this *first-seen*\n+simplification.  One key benefit, the ability for the sender of a\n+transaction to replace it with an alternative version paying higher\n+fees, was realized in [Bitcoin Core 0.12.0][] (February 2016) with the\n+introduction of [BIP125][] opt-in Replace By Fee (RBF).\n+\n+Since then, there has been discussion about completely removing the\n+first-seen simplification and allowing users to replace any of their\n+older unconfirmed transactions with newer transactions, a feature called\n+*full-RBF*.  This release includes a `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n+(allowing only opt-in RBF).\n+\n+Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\n+default for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\n+advocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\n+full-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\n+fees may rapidly become more reliable.\n+\n+Members of this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\n+not accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\n+to take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\n+when their assumptions do not hold.\n+\n+[Bitcoin Core 0.12.0]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\n+[bip125]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\n+  has been reworked.  This is particularly relevant for nodes starting up for the\n+  first time (or for nodes which are starting up after being offline for a long time).\n+\n+  Whenever headers are received from a peer that have a total chainwork that is either\n+  less than the node's `-minimumchainwork` value or is sufficiently below the work at\n+  the node's tip, a \"presync\" phase will begin, in which the node will download the\n+  peer's headers and verify the cumulative work on the peer's chain, prior to storing\n+  those headers permanently. Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,\n+  the headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.\n+\n+  This may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for\n+  the first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effect\n+  of a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node's best headers chain has less\n+  than `-minimumchainwork`), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanism\n+  with the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again). (#25717)\n+\n+- With I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outbound\n+  connection if `-i2pacceptincoming=0`. (#25355)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=softforks` configuration option has been removed.  The\n+  RPC `getblockchaininfo` no longer returns the `softforks` field, which was\n+  previously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status is\n+  now only available via the `getdeploymentinfo` RPC.\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase` configuration option has been removed.\n+  The `receivedby` RPCs (`listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`,\n+  `getreceivedbyaddress` and `getreceivedbylabel`) now always return results\n+  accounting for received coins from coinbase outputs, without an option to\n+  change that behaviour. Excluding coinbases was previously deprecated in 23.0.\n+  (#25171)\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=fees` configuration option has been removed.

Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notice of new option for transaction replacement policies\n+=========================================================\n+\n+This version of Bitcoin Core adds a new `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option which allows users to change the policy their individual node\n+will use for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions.  The option\n+defaults to the same policy that was used in previous releases and no\n+changes to node policy will occur if everyone uses the default.\n+\n+Some Bitcoin services today expect that the first version of an\n+unconfirmed transaction that they see will be the version of the\n+transaction that ultimately gets confirmed---a transaction acceptance\n+policy sometimes called \"first-seen\".\n+\n+The Bitcoin Protocol does not, and cannot, provide any assurance that\n+the first version of an unconfirmed transaction seen by a particular\n+node will be the version that gets confirmed.  If there are multiple\n+versions of the same unconfirmed transaction available, only the miner\n+who includes one of those transactions in a block gets to decide which\n+version of the transaction gets confirmed.\n+\n+Despite this lack of assurance, multiple merchants and services today\n+still make this assumption.\n+\n+There are several benefits to users from removing this *first-seen*\n+simplification.  One key benefit, the ability for the sender of a\n+transaction to replace it with an alternative version paying higher\n+fees, was realized in [Bitcoin Core 0.12.0][] (February 2016) with the\n+introduction of [BIP125][] opt-in Replace By Fee (RBF).\n+\n+Since then, there has been discussion about completely removing the\n+first-seen simplification and allowing users to replace any of their\n+older unconfirmed transactions with newer transactions, a feature called\n+*full-RBF*.  This release includes a `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n+(allowing only opt-in RBF).\n+\n+Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\n+default for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\n+advocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\n+full-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\n+fees may rapidly become more reliable.\n+\n+Members of this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\n+not accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\n+to take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\n+when their assumptions do not hold.\n+\n+[Bitcoin Core 0.12.0]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\n+[bip125]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\n+  has been reworked.  This is particularly relevant for nodes starting up for the\n+  first time (or for nodes which are starting up after being offline for a long time).\n+\n+  Whenever headers are received from a peer that have a total chainwork that is either\n+  less than the node's `-minimumchainwork` value or is sufficiently below the work at\n+  the node's tip, a \"presync\" phase will begin, in which the node will download the\n+  peer's headers and verify the cumulative work on the peer's chain, prior to storing\n+  those headers permanently. Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,\n+  the headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.\n+\n+  This may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for\n+  the first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effect\n+  of a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node's best headers chain has less\n+  than `-minimumchainwork`), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanism\n+  with the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again). (#25717)\n+\n+- With I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outbound\n+  connection if `-i2pacceptincoming=0`. (#25355)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=softforks` configuration option has been removed.  The\n+  RPC `getblockchaininfo` no longer returns the `softforks` field, which was\n+  previously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status is\n+  now only available via the `getdeploymentinfo` RPC.\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase` configuration option has been removed.\n+  The `receivedby` RPCs (`listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`,\n+  `getreceivedbyaddress` and `getreceivedbylabel`) now always return results\n+  accounting for received coins from coinbase outputs, without an option to\n+  change that behaviour. Excluding coinbases was previously deprecated in 23.0.\n+  (#25171)\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=fees` configuration option has been removed. The top-level\n+  fee fields `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees` are no\n+  longer returned by RPCs `getmempoolentry`, `getrawmempool(verbose=true)`,\n+  `getmempoolancestors(verbose=true)` and `getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)`.\n+  The same fee fields can be accessed through the `fees` object in the result.\n+  The top-level fee fields were previously deprecated in 23.0.

This is particularly relevant for nodes starting up for the\n+  first time (or for nodes which are starting up after being offline for a long time).\n+\n+  Whenever headers are received from a peer that have a total chainwork that is either\n+  less than the node's `-minimumchainwork` value or is sufficiently below the work at\n+  the node's tip, a \"presync\" phase will begin, in which the node will download the\n+  peer's headers and verify the cumulative work on the peer's chain, prior to storing\n+  those headers permanently. Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,\n+  the headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.\n+\n+  This may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for\n+  the first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effect\n+  of a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node's best headers chain has less\n+  than `-minimumchainwork`), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanism\n+  with the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again). (#25717)\n+\n+- With I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outbound\n+  connection if `-i2pacceptincoming=0`. (#25355)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=softforks` configuration option has been removed.  The\n+  RPC `getblockchaininfo` no longer returns the `softforks` field, which was\n+  previously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status is\n+  now only available via the `getdeploymentinfo` RPC.\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase` configuration option has been removed.\n+  The `receivedby` RPCs (`listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`,\n+  `getreceivedbyaddress` and `getreceivedbylabel`) now always return results",

      "diff_hunk" : "@@ -0,0 +1,387 @@\n+24.0 Release Notes\n+==================\n+\n+Bitcoin Core version *24.0* is now available from:\n+\n+  <https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-24.0/>\n+\n+This release includes new features, various bug fixes and performance\n+improvements, as well as updated translations.\n+\n+Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:\n+\n+  <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues>\n+\n+To receive security and update notifications, please subscribe to:\n+\n+  <https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/>\n+\n+How to Upgrade\n+==============\n+\n+If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notice of new option for transaction replacement policies\n+=========================================================\n+\n+This version of Bitcoin Core adds a new `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option which allows users to change the policy their individual node\n+will use for relaying and mining unconfirmed transactions.  The option\n+defaults to the same policy that was used in previous releases and no\n+changes to node policy will occur if everyone uses the default.\n+\n+Some Bitcoin services today expect that the first version of an\n+unconfirmed transaction that they see will be the version of the\n+transaction that ultimately gets confirmed---a transaction acceptance\n+policy sometimes called \"first seen\".\n+\n+The Bitcoin Protocol does not, and cannot, provide any assurance that\n+the first version of an unconfirmed transaction seen by a particular\n+node will be the version that gets confirmed.  If there are multiple\n+versions of the same unconfirmed transaction available, only the miner\n+who includes one of those transactions in a block gets to decide which\n+version of the transaction gets confirmed.\n+\n+Despite this lack of assurance, multiple merchants and services today\n+still make this assumption.\n+\n+There are several benefits to users from removing this *first-seen*\n+simplification.  One key benefit, the ability for the sender of a\n+transaction to replace it with an alternative version paying higher\n+fees, was realized in [Bitcoin Core 0.12.0][] (February 2016) with the\n+introduction of [BIP125][] opt-in Replace By Fee (RBF).\n+\n+Since then, there has been discussion about completely removing the\n+first-seen simplification and allowing users to replace any of their\n+older unconfirmed transactions with newer transactions, a feature called\n+*full-RBF*.  This release includes a `mempoolfullrbf` configuration\n+option that allows enabling full-RBF, although it defaults to off\n+(allowing only opt-in RBF).\n+\n+Several alternative node implementations have already enabled full-RBF by\n+default for years, and several contributors to Bitcoin Core are\n+advocating for enabling full-RBF by default in a future version of\n+Bitcoin Core.\n+\n+As more nodes that participate in relay and mining begin enabling\n+full-RBF, replacement of unconfirmed transactions by ones offering higher\n+fees may rapidly become more reliable.\n+\n+Members of this project strongly recommend that merchants and services\n+not accept unconfirmed transactions as final, and if they insist on doing so,\n+to take the appropriate steps to ensure they have some recourse or plan for\n+when their assumptions do not hold.\n+\n+[Bitcoin Core 0.12.0]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions\n+[bip125]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- To address a potential denial-of-service, the logic to download headers from peers\n+  has been reworked.  This is particularly relevant for nodes starting up for the\n+  first time (or for nodes which are starting up after being offline for a long time).\n+\n+  Whenever headers are received from a peer that have a total chainwork that is either\n+  less than the node's `-minimumchainwork` value or is sufficiently below the work at\n+  the node's tip, a \"presync\" phase will begin, in which the node will download the\n+  peer's headers and verify the cumulative work on the peer's chain, prior to storing\n+  those headers permanently. Once that cumulative work is verified to be sufficiently high,\n+  the headers will be redownloaded from that peer and fully validated and stored.\n+\n+  This may result in initial headers sync taking longer for new nodes starting up for\n+  the first time, both because the headers will be downloaded twice, and because the effect\n+  of a peer disconnecting during the presync phase (or while the node's best headers chain has less\n+  than `-minimumchainwork`), will result in the node needing to use the headers presync mechanism\n+  with the next peer as well (downloading the headers twice, again). (#25717)\n+\n+- With I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outbound\n+  connection if `-i2pacceptincoming=0`. (#25355)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The `-deprecatedrpc=softforks` configuration option has been removed.  The\n+  RPC `getblockchaininfo` no longer returns the `softforks` field, which was\n+  previously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status is\n+  now only available via the `getdeploymentinfo` RPC.\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase` configuration option has been removed.\n+  The `receivedby` RPCs (`listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`,\n+  `getreceivedbyaddress` and `getreceivedbylabel`) now always return results\n+  accounting for received coins from coinbase outputs, without an option to\n+  change that behaviour. Excluding coinbases was previously deprecated in 23.0.\n+  (#25171)\n+\n+- The `deprecatedrpc=fees` configuration option has been removed. The top-level\n+  fee fields `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees` are no\n+  longer returned by RPCs `getmempoolentry`, `getrawmempool(verbose=true)`,\n+  `getmempoolancestors(verbose=true)` and `getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)`.\n+  The same fee fields can be accessed through the `fees` object in the result.\n+  The top-level fee fields were previously deprecated in 23.0. (#25204)\n+\n+- The `getpeerinfo` RPC has been updated with a new `presynced_headers` field,\n+  indicating the progress on the presync phase mentioned in the\n+  \"P2P and network changes\" section above.\n+\n+Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.\n+\n+New RPCs\n+--------\n+\n+- The `sendall` RPC spends specific UTXOs to one or more recipients\n+  without creating change. By default, the `sendall` RPC will spend\n+  every UTXO in the wallet. `sendall` is useful to empty wallets or to\n+  create a changeless payment from select UTXOs. When creating a payment\n+  from a specific amount for which the recipient incurs the transaction\n+  fee, continue to use the `subtractfeefromamount` option via the\n+  `send`, `sendtoaddress`, or `sendmany` RPCs. (#24118)\n+\n+- A new `gettxspendingprevout` RPC has been added, which scans the mempool to find\n+  transactions spending any of the given outpoints. (#24408)\n+\n+- The `simulaterawtransaction` RPC iterates over the inputs and outputs of the given\n+  transactions, and tallies up the balance change for the given wallet. This can be\n+  useful e.g. when verifying that a coin join like transaction doesn't contain unexpected\n+  inputs that the wallet will then sign for unintentionally. (#22751)\n+\n+Updated REST APIs\n+-----------------\n+\n+- The `/headers/` and `/blockfilterheaders/` endpoints have been updated to use\n+  a query parameter instead of path parameter to specify the result count. The\n+  count parameter is now optional, and defaults to 5 for both endpoints. The old\n+  endpoints are still functional, and have no documented behaviour change.\n+\n+  For `/headers`, use\n+  `GET /rest/headers/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`\n+  instead of\n+  `GET /rest/headers/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)\n+\n+  For `/blockfilterheaders/`, use\n+  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`\n+  instead of\n+  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)\n+\n+  (#24098)\n+\n+Build System\n+------------\n+\n+- Guix builds are now reproducible across architectures (x86_64 & aarch64). (#21194)\n+\n+New settings\n+------------\n+\n+- A new `mempoolfullrbf` option has been added, which enables the mempool to\n+  accept transaction replacement without enforcing BIP125 replaceability\n+  signaling.
