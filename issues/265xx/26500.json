This results in their conclusions differing from each other in various edge cases which can be very confusing to users. They should probably be unified so that computed balances match the available utxos that coin selection may choose from.\r\n\r\nA possible solution is to have the wallet actually track its (U)TXOs and compute the balance and available coins from that, rather than each having to iterate all txs in the wallet and try to figure out what's relevant.",
