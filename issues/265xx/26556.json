   "body" : "What do people think of more clearly distinguishing [high-priority PRs](https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin/projects/1/views/1) into different phases? Perhaps something like:\r\n\r\n * concept: here's a rough draft, what do people think? looking for concept acks, or different approaches\r\n * wip: here's something the author thinks works; please try it out. the author's happy to make major changes to the PR, fix nits, etc.\r\n * final: this is pretty well baked. now is the time for final review; anything that's not a bug fix will go in a followup PR so as not to invalidate ACKs. everything on here is an implicit review beg!\r\n * rfm: this is (hopefully) ready for merge -- all the questions/complaints have been addressed (either directly or deferred to a followup pr), and there's been some meaningful review resulting in acks. should just be up to maintainers to check everything looks sensible, and either merge it, or bump it back to review with some explanation as to what's up\r\n\r\nI think we could track those states via the new \"projects\" -- I've setup a quick demo at https://github.com/users/ajtowns/projects/2/views/1 . I've added a couple of views that seem like they'd be helpful: one for \"RFM\" PRs (helpful for maintainers?) and one so you can see the PRs that you personally haven't reviewed, split up by whether they're wip/final.\r\n\r\nI believe we could make it pretty low effort:\r\n\r\n * can setup permissions so anyone who's an frequent contributor can add/move PRs themselves, so tweaking it doesn't need to be limited to maintainers\r\n * can use the default workflows so that PRs that get closed automatically get removed from the project, and set it up to automatically move PRs out of \"rfm\" if a \"changes requested\" review comes in. could presumably setup even cleverer workflows via actions or drahtbot or similar too.\r\n\r\n:+1:/:-1:/?",
