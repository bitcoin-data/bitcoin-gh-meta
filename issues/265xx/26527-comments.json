Electrum has similar behavior.\n> \n> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/48174c0f287b19931ca110670610bd03a03eb914/src/wallet/spend.cpp#L725-L731\n> \n> When spending an unconfirmed UTXO, it can happen that we back-date the locktime of our transaction to a locktime before the locktime of the unconfirmed parent. In this case, the \"transaction signed earlier but only broadcast now\" is unrealistic I think (please correct me if you think there is a protocol where this makes sense). This is a fingerprint that we are a Bitcoin Core or Electrum wallet.\n> \n> related https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26526\n> electrum issue: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/8073\n\nCount me in ",
