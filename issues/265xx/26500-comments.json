I first implemented it in spend.cpp as this seemed like the natural location for it, and I could use the `AvailableCoins()` function, but later moved it into receive.cpp and more closely mimiced `getbalance`.\r\n\r\nIf balance calculation and coin selection were unified this RPC would become even easier to implement :)",
