   "body" : "This backward-compatible change would help with code review and testing. When the unit test executables run, they create a working or data directory within `/tmp/test_common_Bitcoin\\ Core/`, named as a long random (hex) string.\r\n\r\nThis small patch does three things:\r\n\r\n- If the environment variable `BITCOIN_TEST_PATH` is set, replace the random string path component with this environment variable's value as the test's working directory\r\n- When the test starts, remove the working directory if it exists from an earlier run (currently, it's presumed not to exist due to the long random string)\r\n- Don't delete the working directory at the end of the test if `BITCOIN_TEST_PATH` is set\r\n\r\nNote that the data directory is constrained to always be within `/tmp/test_common_Bitcoin\\ Core/`. This change affects\r\n- test/test_bitcoin\r\n- bench/bench_bitcoin\r\n- qt/test/test_bitcoin-qt\r\n- test/fuzz/fuzz\r\n\r\nbut it's mainly intended for `test_bitcoin`, which I sometimes run using the debugger. When doing so, it's often useful to watch `debug.log` as the test runs, and inspect some of the other files (I've looked at some of the generated `blknnnn.dat` files for example). Currently, that requires figuring out where the test's working directory is since it changes on every test run. Tests can be run with `-printtoconsole=1` to show debug logging to the terminal, but it's nice to have access to a fixed-named `debug.log` file using an editor, for example.\r\n\r\nEven if not using a debugger, it's often helpful to see `debug.log` and other artifacts after the test completes.\r\n\r\nThis functionality is already possible with the functional tests using the `--tmpdir=` and `--nocleanup` arguments.\r\n\r\nThe reason this patch uses an environment variable instead of command-line arguments is that the boost test framework gets in the way so it doesn't seem to be possible. A few of the other tests already use environment variables.",
