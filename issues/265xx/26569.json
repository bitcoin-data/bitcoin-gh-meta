Even for those peers that have not completed the version handshake. Prior to the PR this was not the case as `ForEachNode` has a \"fully connected check\" before calling a function for each node.\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts back to using `ForEachNode` in `RelayTransaction` to ensure the previous behavior (we should get rid of `ForEachNode` entirely eventually but i am leaving that for another PR).
