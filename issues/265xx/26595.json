   "body" : "`migratewallet` currently operates on wallets that are already loaded, however this is not necessarily required, and in the future, not possible once the legacy wallet is removed. So we need to also be able to give the wallet name to migrate.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the passphrase is required when migrating a wallet. Since a wallet may not be loaded when we migrate, and as we currently unload wallets when migrating, we need the passphrase to be given to `migratewallet` in order to migrate encrypted wallets.\r\n\r\nFixes #27048 ",
