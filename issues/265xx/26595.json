So we need to also be able to give the wallet name to migrate.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the passphrase is required when migrating a wallet. Since a wallet may not be loaded when we migrate, and as we currently unload wallets when migrating, we need the passphrase to be given to `migratewallet` in order to migrate encrypted wallets.",
