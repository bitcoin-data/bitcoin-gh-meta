Even making not signet\nregtests should be as simple as making is_signet configurable.\nWhether that class is called CSignetChainparams or CCustomChainparams\nshouldn't be very important IMO.\nAnd if it was the other way around, signet could just be adding those\nparameters to the existing class.\nI can produce 2 branches with this and signet. One with this first and the\nother with signet first.\nAlthough if I do both of them the end result will be the same in both. But\nthat may be useful to see what I have in mind.
