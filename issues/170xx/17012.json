   "body" : "Our current UPnP support works for IPv4 by requesting a port forward. It doesn't work with IPv6 when the user is behind a firewall (which was the default for my modem at least).\r\n\r\nMore recent versions of [libupnp](https://github.com/miniupnp/miniupnp) support requesting a IPv6 pinhole.\r\n\r\nI haven't checked if the same could be done with NAT-PMP (#11902). That may be preferable to updating libupnp.\r\n\r\nUPnP is baked into the GUI release binaries, though it's turned off by default in the settings dialog.",
