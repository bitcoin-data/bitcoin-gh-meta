   "body" : "This bug has been around for a while (at least 0.17 from what I remember) but I guess no one opened an issue for it. I also have been unable to debug this at all.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when importing public keys and scripts which already have a balance, the balance is not detected after the import's rescan finishes. This has particularly occurred with the use of `importmulti` (but I suspect it should happen with the other `import` commands, I just don't use those). Even with the timestamp set correctly and with repeated rescans afterwards using `rescanblockchain`, no balance is found. However later transactions involving those keys and scripts are found.\r\n\r\nAttempts to debug this have not been successful as this does not appear to be reproducible (attempts to intentionally reproduce this have failed).\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this is due to user error (perhaps some timestamp thing), but if that is the case, we should probably remove this footgun.\r\n\r\nThis issue was also described in an importmulti related PR some time ago. I'm trying to find that comment.",
