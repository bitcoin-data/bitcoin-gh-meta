   "body" : "If you use the `submitblock` RPC with a large enough block you'll run into \"argument list too long\". Using a pipe should fix this, at least on Linux / macOS.\r\n\r\nThe `submitblock` RPC can be useful to check validity of a stale block that never made it into the main chain (and that your node never fetched): call `invalidateblock` on its same-height-sibling and then feed it the raw block.\r\n\r\nEasiest workaround is to use a library that connects directly to `bitcoind` via RPC (be careful to avoid a line break character at the end). Using the GUI console fails with \"Block decode failed\" for me, but haven't tested that extensively.   ",
