They are the extremes, whereas \"light\" and \"dark\" are used to subjectively or contextually denominate some place in between. The purpose of these words are very similar to the purpose of the word \"red\", which conveys a specific sensation when observing a measurable frequency on the electromagnetic spectrum, except red is a color, and white & black are not.\r\n\r\nHuman skin is neither white or black, they are all shades of brown _(and maybe some red after a hot day at the beach)_. While it's clear to me why humans have chosen to adopt these words and apply them to the human condition of outwardly observable genetic diversity, it's not quite clear to me why this adoption should then trickle back to the original meaning and purpose of the words themselves. Given that all humans are People-of-Color, it is impossible for the words white and black, without any stated context, to meaningfully apply to PoC _(like myself, you, and everyone else)_.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of changing the words in consideration of the sensitive among us, where those sensitive individuals might apply their _own_ context when no such context was provided by the use of the words: If the words blacklist and whitelist were to be changed to, for example, nightlist and daylist, this could potentially offend people who identify as nocturnal animals, or people who like to tan at the beach. They too would have to apply their own context to those words in order to become offended, but this is no different than those who take issue with the words white and black. Since many in the FOSS community are anonymous it's impossible to know if there are these kinds of _(perfectly fine)_ people working on the project currently, or might otherwise be attracted to this project in the future.\r\n\r\nNow, one might argue that one set of people is a known known, while the other set is a known unknown _(I believe Nocturnal Furrys are inherently known unknowns)_, but I argue that it's simply not proper to prioritize the feelings of one set of contributors over another set, as that lays the groundwork of precedent for additional emotional/irrational changes in the code moving into the future. With that being said, I believe it to be much more important to focus on meaningful development and not get distracted by political signaling, or open the door for more political creep into the project.",

The developers who pushed this through quickly may not have had bad intent, it's just the fear to be seen to be against \"inclusive language\" was too great for them to handle.\r\n\r\nThe mainstream media would be all too happy to associate Bitcoin with racists and the alt-right too, if given the chance and a whiff of an excuse, so let's not be _too harsh_ on the developers here for bending to the SJW narrative since the change was quite harmless. The mainstream media is still quite powerful for now, if they can turn pepe the fucking frog into a symbol of hate, they'd have no trouble turning Bitcoin into \"money for nazis\".\r\n\r\nAgree with everyone else though, no more of this nonsense. But I somewhat understand why they bent the knee, even though I personally would have told the original author of the PR to fuck off.",

No one ever says which PRs to review, which issues to respond to, or which things to work on. Colleagues just ask if you have a few cycles available to review or re-review their work, which happens a lot (and is fine) but it wasn't the case for that PR. Or, someone might suggest an old PR that could be picked up if you ask. Everything happens in an ad-hoc, free manner, and that's how I like it and think it should be. There might be coordination, but other than the public weekly irc meetings, I haven't seen it. There is so much to do, the stack of PRs to review grows and grows, and so many important things to worry about, that a PR like that one is pretty much at the bottom of the list of things to allocate time and energy to. It's not surprising to me that it would be handled quickly to free up bandwidth for all the rest.\r\n\r\nCoordination? It's actually kind of the opposite. Apart from discussion on GitHub, there is almost no direct feedback. You kind of wonder. How can I do better. It's a quiet, focused, set-your-own priorities-and-schedule sort of life. For me, anyway. Hope this helps. Cheers.",
