   "body" : "\r\nI have two bitcoin core full nodes. I have one wallet.dat file on both nodes. One node is a master and second node is a reserve. Master signs and sends transactions. Reserve node only receives updates from network. I create new addresses on the master node only and the reserve node derives the same addresses.\r\n\r\nI donât use any other commands on the reserve node. The reserve node creates addresses automatically after receiving a transaction to a new address. This process is possible due to using BIP32 key derivation from one master key.\r\n\r\nSo, I have constantly synchronized master and reserve nodes. If there are problems with the master, then I switch to the reserve.\r\n\r\nI see some strange behavior appear during this process. Some transactions are not shown in the `listtransactions` output. I did a research an found that only \"in-wallet\" transactions are not shown in the `listransactions`. The \"in-wallet\" transactions are transactions that were sent with senderâs and receiverâs keys, which are stored in my wallet. I also found that new addresses on the reserve node are created whithout a label.\r\n\r\nAfter adding a label to the address the problem is gone. But adding a label requires additional steps I want to avoid.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nResults of `listtransactions` also shown \"in-wallet\" transactions to addresses without labels\r\n\r\n\r\n**Current Behavior**\r\n\r\nResults of `listtransactions` doesnât shown \"in-wallet\" transactions to addresses without labels\r\n\r\n**Possible Solution**\r\n\r\n- Automatic adding of a default label to the addresses, derived to the reserve node.\r\n\r\n- Print transactions sent to addresses without labels in `listtransactions`.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1.  Run and sync full nodes A and B.\r\n\r\n2.  Stop nodes A and B.\r\n\r\n3.  Copy wallet.dat from node A to node B.\r\n\r\n4.  Run nodes A and B\r\n\r\n5.  Use `getnewaddress` method on node A 10 times. Letâs assume the 10-th address is `$ADDRESS`.\r\n\r\n6.  Use `sendtoaddress` method on node A. Send 0.001 coins from another address to the `$ADDRESS`. `bitcoin-cli sendtoaddress $ADDRESS 0.001`. Letâs assume the result txid is `$TXID`.\r\n\r\n7.  Use `listtransaction \"*\"` method on node B. You donât see the `$TXID` transaction in list.\r\n\r\n8.  Use `gettransactions`, or `listunspent` methods on node B. You can see the transaction details. Wallet balance changed on node B and is equal to node A.\r\n\r\n9.  Use `getaddressinfo $ADDRESS` method on node A. You can see that address had the default label (`\"\"`).\r\n\r\n10. Use `getaddressinfo $ADDRESS` method on node B. You can see that the address doesnât have any label.\r\n\r\n**Context (Environment)**\r\n\r\nThe problem is occured on any version of bitcoin core testnet and mainnet. The problem is also occured on litecoin and any bitcoin-based coins.\r\n\r\n",
