(Downside is that this needs maintenance)\r\n* Remove tests until no timeouts can be observed. (Will be hard to decide which tests to drop, especially considering that our current tests don't even result in adequate coverage)\r\n* Remove tsan test completely and run it once before every release. (Downside is that failures will be fixed last minute or not at all)\r\n* Remove tsan test and run it nightly. (Downside is that failures will be fixed after they happened, nightly builds will fail until they are fixed)\r\n* Pay cirrus ci to have no 2h timeout. (Downside: Forked repos would time out)\r\n* Temporarily bump the CPU and memory to buy time.\r\n* Something else ... ?",
