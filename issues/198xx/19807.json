I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\r\nSetting a lower-than-current prune height via `pruneblockchain` currently requires a full resync. On slower machines, this can take a very long time. It is also unnecessary.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\nSince all block headers are retained for PoW and chain reorg purposes, bitcoind could feasibly re-download the raw blocks that are lower than the *old* cursor, and above the *new* cursor, and check their validity against the retained headers.\r\n",
