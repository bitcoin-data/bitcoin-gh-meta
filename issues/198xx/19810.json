Please describe.**\r\nI am working with a team on Yeti (https://github.com/JWWeatherman/yeticold), which is a script for a UI for setting up offline, HD multisig with only minimal software beyond Bitcoin Core.  Only QR codes are used for transferring private keys.  As Core continues to merge PRs on offline, multisig, and UI work, Yeti will remove its own written code for the more peer reviewed Core releases.  The goal is that Yeti is eventually not needed at all.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Core needs a blockchain to sign transactions, even if the wallet is offline (and doesn't truly need a blockchain).  This means that although the wallet is getting the data it needs to sign from the QR code, the process now must look like this:\r\n\r\nThe computer needs to be online for days first in order to sync the blockchain (even though it'll never be used), then network access can be disabled, and descriptors generated.  This could be made much simpler without having to sync.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI know there is a lot of work on making Core more modular (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).  Once that project is finished, is it part of the plan to be able to sign transactions without a blockchain present?\r\n",
