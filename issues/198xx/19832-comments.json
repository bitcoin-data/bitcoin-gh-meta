There may be objections to that which I'm not aware of, though.\r\n\r\n> @jonatack: No objections. I'd take it ever further though, and add an (optional) logging severity (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR or similar) that can be added to all log messages. The user can then either choose what severity logs they want for each category (eg = -debug=net:warning,tor:debug etc), or have a logging post-processor that can filter by severity/category.\r\n\r\nI'd still like this, may propose something soon :tm: \r\n",
