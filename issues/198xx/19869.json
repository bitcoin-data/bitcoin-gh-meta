If an attempt to connect to a feeler wasn't actually made (an entry from AddrMan we considered was invalid, or we made too many tries, or it didn't have the right flag) â wait less until we try the next feeler.\r\n2. Make those intervals mockable\r\n3. Remove unnecessary extra random noise between feelers\r\n\r\n(1) would make transitioning from \"new\" to \"tried\" better in the presence of those events. An adversary here fills our \"new\" table with garbage to prevent us from trying honest peers from \"new\". This probably won't help much against a very powerful adversary but will help against a moderate adversary. It also may help in natural non-malicious cases.\r\n\r\nMoving from \"new\" to \"tried\" table is important for p2p security.",
