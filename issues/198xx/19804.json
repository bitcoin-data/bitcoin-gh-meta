   "body" : "The `TestNode` has a `p2p` property which is an alias for `p2ps[0]`.\r\n\r\nI think this should be removed because it can be confusing and misleading (to both the test writer and reviewer), especially if a TestNode has multiple p2ps connected (which is the case for many tests). \r\nAnother example is when a test has multiple subtests that connect 1 p2p and use the `p2p` property to reference it. If the subtests don't completely clean up after themselves, the subtests may affect one another. \r\n\r\nThe best way to refer to a connected p2p is use the object returned by `add_p2p_connection` like this:\r\n```py\r\np2p_conn = node.add_p2p_connection(P2PInterface())\r\n```\r\nA good example is [p2p_invalid_locator.py](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/p2p_invalid_locator.py), which cleans up after itself (waits in both `wait_for_disconnect` and in `disconnect_p2ps`) but wouldn't need so much complexity if it just referenced the connections directly.\r\n\r\nIf there is only one connected, it's not really that tedious to just use `node.p2ps[0]` instead of `node.p2p` (and it can always be aliased inside the test itself).",
