Improve that by slight refactoring.\r\n\r\nThe only behavior change is that the following will be also applied to the first (pre-VERACK) self-announcement:\r\n```   \r\n// If discovery is enabled, sometimes give our peer the address it\r\n// tells us that it sees us as in case it has a better idea of our\r\n// address than we do.\r\n```\r\nAnd I think it's a good change anyway.\r\n\r\nThe last commit is just to consider the first self-announcement as regular and reset the timer, so that we don't send the second self-announcement too soon.\r\nNote that since the first self-announcement is made at the end of processing VERSION, at that point addrLocal would be already filled with what the peers tells us we are, so this self-announcement would be no worse than any further one.",
