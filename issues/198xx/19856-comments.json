      "body" : "It looks like this is primarily due to how change detection works. Essentially, outputs that go to the wallet are detected as change, because, by definition, that is what change is. So your send-to-self transactions do not appear in `listtransactions` because they are being detected as change.\r\n\r\nGenerally it is not advised to have the same wallet loaded in multiple places as you get unexpected behavior like what you are seeing. A lot of the wallet's change detection functionality is based on user actions within the wallet (like requesting addresses), and so it can kind of break when you have a wallet where the user isn't interacting with it directly (i.e. node B).",
