So your send-to-self transactions do not appear in `listtransactions` because they are being detected as change.\r\n\r\nGenerally it is not advised to have the same wallet loaded in multiple places as you get unexpected behavior like what you are seeing. A lot of the wallet's change detection functionality is based on user actions within the wallet (like requesting addresses), and so it can kind of break when you have a wallet where the user isn't interacting with it directly (i.e. node B).",
