As soon a I symlinked the single files in `index` folder, I wasnÂ´t able to run bitcoind and received the same error like you.\r\nSolution: DonÂ´t symlink the files inside `index`, but symlink the whole folder instead (`ln -s /path/to/blocks/index index` inside of your `blocks` folder) âï¸ ",

I was only migrating the blk and rev files, and kept the two most recent on the local drive. I started doing this a few versions ago because I noticed startup was faster if at least some files were on the local drive. I tried symlinking the entire blocks folder with no improvement.\r\n\r\nThen I tried using the HDD for the entire data directory and core won't open. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49789899/92397481-ba296300-f0db-11ea-838b-e3ad1f3360e6.png)\r\n\r\nMight go back to v0.19...\r\n",
