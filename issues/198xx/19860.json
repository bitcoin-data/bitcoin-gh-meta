   "body" : "This PR improves the logic around netgroup diversity of new connections. More specifically, it improves privacy and fixes a couple things I consider buggy. It also adds a bunch of documentation. \r\n\r\nThis PR changes the following:\r\n1. prevents short-lived ADDR_FETCH and FEELER connections from affecting our further peer selection, because they are short-lived and should not matter\r\n2. ADDR_FETCH and FEELER conns are now not included in `count_failure` consideration (see new documentation). Even though it *makes sense* to consider them if they are present at the moment of the call, we should not rely on that luck. Instead, we should be explicit.\r\n3. Prevents BLOCK_RELAY connections from affecting our further full-relay peer selection, because otherwise, an attacker with sufficient ADDR-related capabilities may infer to which netgroups those (supposedly more private) connections belong. \r\n\r\nIâm also not sure whether *new* BLOCK_RELAY connections should be distinct w.r.t *existent* full outbound connections. Seems like another influence vector for an attacker with AddrMan poisoning capabilities, but this threat is probably too advanced. And having a good diversity of BLOCK_RELAY conns is very beneficial.",
