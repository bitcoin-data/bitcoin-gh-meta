   "body" : "AFAICT, as of commit a0a422c,  we have 2 different logics to evict outbound peers : lagging-chain (`ConsiderEviction`) and (`CheckForStaleTipAndEvictPeers`). The former to sanitize out lazy/buggy peers who have never sent us a valid header and are always staying behind our tip, the latter triggered in case of stale tip due to block variance to seek a better chain by rotating our outbound peers if we already reach an outbound limit (`EvictExtraOutboundPeers`).\r\n\r\nBlock-relay-only peers were introduced by #15719. Contrary to outbound full-relay peers who provided us at least a useful header, they're not protected by lagging-chain eviction.\r\n\r\nWe actually have a comment inside `ProcessHeadersMessage` indicating the contrary behavior. We should either document cleanly that block-relay-only aren't protected or effectively extend the scope of protection to them.\r\n\r\nHinted during #19724 review, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19724#discussion_r475144532",
