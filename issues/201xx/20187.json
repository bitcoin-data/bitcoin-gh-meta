   "body" : "This PR does two things:\r\n\r\n* Block-relay-only interaction with addrman.  \r\n  * Calling `CAddrMan::Connected()` on an address that was a block-relay-only peer causes the time we report in `addr` messages containing that peer to be updated; particularly now that we use anchor connections with a our block-relay-only peers, this risks leaking information about those peers.  So, stop this.\r\n  * Avoiding calling `CAddrMan::Good()` on block-relay-only peer addresses causes the addrman logic around maintaining the new and tried table to be less good, and in particular makes it so that block-relay-only peer addresses are more likely to be evicted from the addrman (for no good reason I can think of).  So, mark those addresses as good when we connect.\r\n\r\n* Fix test-before-evict bug. There's a bug where if we get a collision in the tried table with an existing address that is one of our current peers, and the connection is long-lived enough, then `SelectTriedCollisions()` might return that existing peer address to us as a test-before-evict connection candidate. However, our logic for new outbound connections would later prevent us from actually making a connection; the result would be that when we get a collision with a long-lived current peer, that peer's address is likely to get evicted from the tried table.  Fix this by checking to see if a test-before-evict candidate is a peer we're currently connected to, and if so, mark it as `Good()`.\r\n",
