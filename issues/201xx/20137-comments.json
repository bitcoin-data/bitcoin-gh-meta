We'll need this in `master` uncommented eventually (when upgrading to Clang 12).\r\n\r\nFor me personally I already have the patch in my repo, but I'm hopefully not the only one building Bitcoin Core with the latest version of Clang (to get early notification of compilation issues/compiler bugs, to get the best libFuzzer and diagnostics goodies, etc.) we support so I thought it would be helpful to upstream it commented out for now :)",
