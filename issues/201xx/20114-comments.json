Pre-auth RPC issues (and post-auth RPC issues such as #17742) are not even considered vulnerabilities in Bitcoin Core (they get no CVE) since we assume that merely exposing the RPC port is unsafe. More specifically we're operating under the trust boundary assumption that an attacker cannot connect to the RPC port.",
