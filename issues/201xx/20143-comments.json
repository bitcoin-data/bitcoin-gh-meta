As the `mockscheduler` call is non-blocking and there is no way to observe to-be-trickled txids over RPC or P2P, the only way to synchronize this event I see is over `assert_debug_log`. Fixed in #20112 \r\n\r\n\r\nLonger term, `mockscheduler` should probably be blocking until all events that are scheduled in the past have been executed.",
