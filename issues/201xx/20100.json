   "body" : "Fixes #20009. \r\n\r\nThis PR consists of three commits.\r\nFirst commit: Separates `CLEANSTACK` into `WITNESS_CLEANSTACK` and `CLEANSTACK`. See \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20006#issuecomment-698487304 for motivation. \r\n\r\nSecond commit: The stack size for witness programs was being explicitly resized to 1 to get around \r\n`CLEANSTACK` check. This commits removes that logic and does some code cleanup. This commit\r\nmay require careful review to see if this does not change anything unintended. \r\n\r\nThird commit: Refactor `MINIMALIF` to `WITNESS_MINIMALIF` and changes the error message. \r\n\r\n The Tapscript related error codes were handled in #19953.
