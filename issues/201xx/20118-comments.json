Given that using BDB is (being) deprecated, there is somewhat less reason to fix this. This is compunded by the fact that if this has indeed been broken for 2 years, and not a single other person has realised / opened an issue, clearly `BITCOIN_SUBDIR_TO_INCLUDE` is not getting much actual use, and isn't regularly breaking anyones ability to build (with BDB).\r\n\r\n> Maybe consider https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/2ef8a6fc3b1de989702adb04ebb066bd101350f0 ?\r\n\r\nCould be a (much simpler to review and grok) option, but so could just removing this code entirely, if it is completely broken, given the point above.",
