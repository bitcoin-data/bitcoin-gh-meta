We should probably remove it. \r\n\r\nHi @prayank23, here is a possible workflow that I would use.\r\n\r\n- You can start by looking at all the RPCs listed in the remove the `reqSigs` field from that. \r\n- You can also grep for `reqSigs` in the root directory to find all occurrences.\r\n- Try to run unit tests and let the failures guide you where things need to the fixed/removed. \r\n- My suspicion is that we can also remove the code that has the bare multisig logic that computes this field. \r\n- You may also need to run python functional tests (see `test/functional`) to check if there are tests that are broken because of this. \r\n- Since this field is being removed, try to find comments around the code are removing and remove those too.",
