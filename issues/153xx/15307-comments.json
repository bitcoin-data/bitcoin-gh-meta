Making the wallet tool into a limited frontend for a subset RPC methods that work offline (suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13926#issuecomment-455187379) would be a good approach that would enable code sharing, and also decrease the likelihood of a garbagey command line parsing code getting added to wallet tool in the future. But other approaches are certainly possible.",
