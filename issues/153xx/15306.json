Notably, any rpc calls that import keys don't need to update the `nTimeFirstKey`.\r\n\r\nI think `nTimeFirstKey` should be removed as a wallet global entirely. I think `-rescan` as a wallet command-line argument can also be removed since we now have the `rescan()` rpc method (removing `-rescan` has been suggested here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7061#issuecomment-303711520 and here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/13044#issuecomment-384339967). _If_ we want to retain the ability to rescan from the wallet's birthday (ie the earliest key birthday in the wallet), then there should be a function `GetWalletBirthday()` to iterate through the wallet keys and return the wallet's birthday instead of having a wallet global.",
