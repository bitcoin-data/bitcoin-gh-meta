   "body" : "In order to debug a validation error (e.g. `tx-size-small` or `non-mandatory-script-verify-flag`), you have to search through the source code and determine the meaning of the error. While many are self-explanatory, some are not, especially if exposed to end users. Therefore, some error message translation is necessary. It would be helpful to have a list of these errors in the code in one place. It would also be helpful for external software application development to have a list and description of these errors in the documentation. Happy to submit a PR if this isn't already being done and if there are any specific implementation suggestions.\r\n",
