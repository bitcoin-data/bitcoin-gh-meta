You can get it [here](https://github.com/MarcoFalke/yapf-diff).\n+\n+Rebasing/Merging code\n+-------------\n+\n+### More conflict context with `merge.conflictstyle diff3`\n+\n+For resolving merge/rebase conflicts, it can be useful to enable diff3 style using `git config merge.conflictstyle diff3`. Instead of\n+\n+```diff\n+<<<\n+yours\n+===\n+theirs\n+>>>\n+```\n+\n+  you will see\n+\n+```diff\n+<<<\n+yours\n+|||\n+original\n+===\n+theirs\n+>>>\n+```\n+\n+This may make it much clearer what caused the conflict. In this style, you can often just look at what changed between *original* and *theirs*, and mechanically apply that to *yours* (or the other way around).\n+\n+Reviewing code\n+--------------\n+\n+### Reduce mental load with `git diff` options\n+\n+When reviewing patches which change indentation in C++ files, use `git diff -w` and `git show -w`. This makes the diff algorithm ignore whitespace changes. This feature is also available on github.com, by adding `?w=1` at the end of any URL which shows a diff.\n+\n+When reviewing patches that change symbol names in many places, use `git diff --word-diff`. This will instead of showing the patch as deleted/added *lines*, show deleted/added *words*.\n+\n+When reviewing patches that move code around, try using `git diff --patience commit~:old/file.cpp commit:new/file/name.cpp`, and ignoring everything except the moved body of code which should show up as neither `+` or `-` lines. In case it was not a pure move, this may even work when combined with the `-w` or `--word-diff` options described above.",

It speeds up recompilation by caching the result of previous compilations and detecting when the same compilation is being done again. Supported languages are C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++.\n+\n+Install `ccache` through your distribution's package manager, and follow the symlinks method [here](https://ccache.samba.org/manual/latest.html#_run_modes) to set it up.\n+\n+### Disable features with `./configure`\n+\n+After running `./autogen.sh`, which generates the `./configure` file, use `./configure --help` to identify features that you can disable to save on compilation time. A few common flags:\n+\n+```sh\n+--without-miniupnpc\n+--disable-bench\n+--disable-wallet\n+--without-gui\n+```\n+\n+### Make use of your threads with `make -j`\n+\n+If you have multiple threads on your machine, you can tell `make` to utilize all of them with:\n+\n+```sh\n+make -j$(nproc)\n+```\n+\n+If you want `make` to not limit the number of jobs that can run simultaneously, do:\n+\n+```sh\n+make -j\n+```\n+\n+### Multiple working directories with `git worktrees`\n+\n+If you work with multiple branches or multiple copies of the repository, you should try `git worktrees`.\n+\n+To create a new branch that lives under a new working directory without disrupting your current working directory (useful for creating pull requests):\n+```sh\n+git worktree add -b my-shiny-new-branch ../living-at-my-new-working-directory based-on-my-crufty-old-commit-ish\n+```\n+\n+To simply check out a commit-ish under a new working directory without disrupting your current working directory (useful for reviewing pull requests):\n+```sh\n+git worktree add --checkout ../where-my-checkout-commit-ish-will-live my-checkout-commit-ish\n+```\n+\n+-----\n+\n+This synergizes well with [`ccache`](#cache-compilations-with-ccache) as objects resulting from unchanged code will most likely hit the cache and won't need to be recompiled.\n+\n+You can also set up [upstream refspecs](#reference-prs-easily-with-refspecs) to refer to pull requests easier in the above `git worktree` commands.\n+\n+Writing code\n+------------\n+\n+### Format C/C++/Protobuf diffs with `clang-format-diff.py`\n+\n+See [contrib/devtools/README.md](contrib/devtools/README.md#clang-format-diff.py).\n+\n+### Format Python diffs with `yapf-diff.py`\n+\n+Usage is exactly the same as [`clang-format-diff.py`](#format-ccprotobuf-diffs-with-clang-format-diffpy). You can get it [here](https://github.com/MarcoFalke/yapf-diff).\n+\n+Rebasing/Merging code\n+-------------\n+\n+### More conflict context with `merge.conflictstyle diff3`\n+\n+For resolving merge/rebase conflicts, it can be useful to enable diff3 style using `git config merge.conflictstyle diff3`. Instead of\n+\n+```diff\n+<<<\n+yours\n+===\n+theirs\n+>>>\n+```\n+\n+  you will see\n+\n+```diff\n+<<<\n+yours\n+|||\n+original\n+===\n+theirs\n+>>>\n+```\n+\n+This may make it much clearer what caused the conflict. In this style, you can often just look at what changed between *original* and *theirs*, and mechanically apply that to *yours* (or the other way around).\n+\n+Reviewing code\n+--------------\n+\n+### Reduce mental load with `git diff` options\n+\n+When reviewing patches which change indentation in C++ files, use `git diff -w` and `git show -w`. This makes the diff algorithm ignore whitespace changes. This feature is also available on github.com, by adding `?w=1` at the end of any URL which shows a diff.\n+\n+When reviewing patches that change symbol names in many places, use `git diff --word-diff`. This will instead of showing the patch as deleted/added *lines*, show deleted/added *words*.\n+\n+When reviewing patches that move code around, try using `git diff --patience commit~:old/file.cpp commit:new/file/name.cpp`, and ignoring everything except the moved body of code which should show up as neither `+` or `-` lines. In case it was not a pure move, this may even work when combined with the `-w` or `--word-diff` options described above.",

It speeds up recompilation by caching the result of previous compilations and detecting when the same compilation is being done again. Supported languages are C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++.\n+\n+Install `ccache` through your distribution's package manager, and run `./configure` with your normal flags to pick it up. ",
