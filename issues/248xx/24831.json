   "body" : "We recently added a [`clang-tidy` job](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/ci/test/00_setup_env_native_tidy.sh) to the CI, which generates a compilation database. We can leverage that now existing database to begin running [include-what-you-use](https://include-what-you-use.org/) over the codebase.\r\n\r\nThis PR demonstrates using a mapping_file to indicate fixups / includes that may differ from IWYU suggestions. In this case, I've added some fixups for glibc includes that I've [upstreamed changes for](https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use/pull/1026):\r\n```bash\r\n# Fixups / upstreamed changes\r\n[\r\n  { include: [ \"<bits/termios-c_lflag.h>\", private, \"<termios.h>\", public ] },\r\n  { include: [ \"<bits/termios-struct.h>\", private, \"<termios.h>\", public ] },\r\n  { include: [ \"<bits/termios-tcflow.h>\", private, \"<termios.h>\", public ] },\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe include \"fixing\" commits of this PR:\r\n* Adds missing includes.\r\n* Swaps C headers for their C++ counterparts.\r\n* Removes the pointless / unmaintainable `//for abc, xyz` comments. When using IWYU, if anyone wants to see / generate those comments, to see why something is included, it is trivial to do so (IWYU outputs them by default). i.e:\r\n```cpp\r\n// The full include-list for compat/stdin.cpp:\r\n#include <compat/stdin.h>\r\n#include <poll.h>                  // for poll, pollfd, POLLIN\r\n#include <termios.h>               // for tcgetattr, tcsetattr\r\n#include <unistd.h>                // for isatty, STDIN_FILENO\r\n```\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] Qt mapping_file. There is one in the IWYU repo, but it's for Qt 5.11. Needs testing.\r\n- [ ] Boost mapping_file. There is one in the IWYU repo, but it's for Boost 1.75. Needs testing.\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting we turn this on the for entire codebase, or immediately go-nuts refactoring all includes. However I think our dependency includes are now slim enough, and our CI infrastructure in place such that we can start doing this in some capacity, and just automate away include fixups / refactorings etc.",
