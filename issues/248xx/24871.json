   "body" : "The implementation of `GetTime` is confusing:\r\n* The value returned by `GetTime` is assumed to be equal to `GetTime<std::chrono::seconds>()`. Both are mockable and the only difference is return type, the value itself is equal. However, the implementation does not support this assumption.\r\n* On some systems, `time_t` might be a signed 32-bit integer (https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/chrono/time), thus breaking in the year 2038, whereas `GetTime<std::chrono::seconds>` does not. Also, `time_t` might be `-1` \"on error\", where \"error\" is unspecified.\r\n* `GetTime<std::chrono::seconds>` calls `GetTimeMicros`, which calls `GetSystemTime`, which calls `std::chrono::system_clock::now`, which doesn't have the above issues. See https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/system_clock/now\r\n* `GetTimeMicros` and the internal-only `GetSystemTime` will likely be renamed (to clarify they are the non-mockable non-monotonic system time) or removed in the future to be replaced by appropriate `std::chrono::time_point<Clock>` getters.\r\n\r\nFix all issues by:\r\n* making `GetTime()` an alias for `GetTime<std::chrono::seconds>().count()`.\r\n* inlining the needed parts of `GetSystemTime` directly instead of needlessly increasing the function call stack with functions that are likely to be removed in the future.",
