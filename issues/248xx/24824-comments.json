Your commits will need to be squashed before anything is merged in any case.\r\n\r\nAddressing the uncleanliness of this PR. Should this be PR remade? I can squash from here on out, I will learn from my mistakes but am still newish to git.\r\n\r\nThe larger issue to determine is if downloading a blob at runtime any better than parsing http://www.team-cymru.com/IP-ASN-mapping.html as makeseeds.py does right now? The other option would be to determine an acceptable database size for the ip to ASN database? I don't foresee anything smaller than 1MB with trimming and compression.\r\n\r\nThings to compress the ASN database would be to \r\n\r\n- Use a tree like structure where a node is an ASN and would connect to ranges it controls\r\n- Instead of writing the whole IP Address in the end range field, use the number of consecutive ip addresses owned in that block\r\n\r\n_Edit: Would a duality solution where the user could download an ASN file and if detected makeseeds would use it, If no ip->asn database file exists then the failover would be to parse http://www.team-cymru.com/IP-ASN-mapping.html as makeseeds is doing right now._\r\n\r\nThe issue as presented in #17020 suggests to not hardcode an ASN and then place it in a file in the same way as suspicious hosts are. The ASN directory is quite massive and doesn't follow any specific patterns due to the fact it's a registry of real world relations. Thus a hardcoded dataset with potentially billions of entries will require quite a bit of space.\r\n ",

Your commits will need to be squashed before anything is merged in any case.\r\n\r\nThere is now a mechanism in the class object to fetch the ip-asn directory database .gz file at runtime. The user can also load directly from a file they have created or obtained on their own if they wish without parsing an external source. A feature has been added is that if the asn db file is not loaded _or used_ the class fails over to a 1:1 clone of the current implementation to decode the ASN information that fetches though an api request.\r\n\r\nEdit: Working on fixing this PR -> some branch elements are not in sync with the master. \r\nCurrent master implementation - time\r\n![master](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3104223/162868213-ed49bcd1-b5cb-4cb6-9348-281bd893043b.jpg)\r\nASN in file database time\r\n![contrib](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3104223/162868364-3944b67c-349a-4cf5-971e-287bf5e2f01b.jpg)\r\n\r\nNote that the current implementation in this PR was able to resolve an IPv6 Address that was not resolvable via the current API service. If the ASN Database could not find a range for the current ip it would have failed over to the API call and the error in master would have been present in this branch.\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: I could use some assistance fixing this branch. I have made some mistakes and I don't know how to walk them back.",
