But to me, the damage is done. My hope was that by having a well-documented coding style years ago, we could start converging on a single style. If having such a document isn't enough to get people to follow it, then that's a sign we simply don't enforce coding styles. That's ok - it can stay as a description of the used style rather than defining the rules people should follow - and in that sense it's great that you're trying to reconcile them.\r\n\r\n> If the project maintainers really feel that this (I think useful?) convention should be avoided, I trust that @ryanofsky and I will stop adding code that violates the desired style policy.\r\n\r\nI don't have any problems with lowerCamel or distinguishing member functions from non-member functions, but changing the policy is just a step backwards in terms of getting the style consistent, and consistency was more important to me than individual style decisions.\r\n\r\nThere are also reasons that make it inherently hard to follow a consistent style too - beyond anyone's control even. For example, the documented style doesn't match STL's, so when code gets added that implements STL interfaces, it's forced to violate whatever style we have written up. So perhaps my hope wasn't realistic in the first place.",

Apparently the rules here didn't avoid bike-shedding among developers that are familiar with this project. Also, I doubt that any new contributor reads this file (and understands it well enough to keep in mind) before starting to contribute. The docs are also a bit contradictory when they say pure-style review-comments are not welcome and then there is a 65kB document <strike>prescribing</strike> describing the style. Overall I think any style guideline that is purely stylistic and doesn't help to fight bugs is a candidate for removal. And those that evidently fight bugs (like arg comments) are ideally enforced by tools (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8e3c266a4f02093d57d563f32ba73d3ab4b5f208/src/.clang-tidy#L2) and not a style guide that is discouraged to be enforced.\r\n\r\nThe `lowerCamelCase` interface style is already described in this document (in the section \"Internal interface guidelines\"), but reading the previous comments on this discussion no one seems to be aware of this. Another data point that even regular contributors have difficulties keeping the ideas mentioned in the full length of this document in mind?",

      "body" : "> My hope was that by having a well-documented coding style years ago, we could start converging on a single style. If having such a document isn't enough to get people to follow it, then that's a sign we simply don't enforce coding styles.\r\n\r\nWe could use clang-tidy to start making CI error out when the style gets made more inconsistent. It's a bit challenging given we've already got a huge inconsistent mess of styles, but I think the following approach could be made to work.\r\n\r\n1. Pick which modules follow \"our\" coding style, and which ones follow some other style (eg something more like the STL's style with snake_case, or qt/capnproto's lowerCamelCase style, or are imported from upstream like tinyformat or secp256k1 or leveldb)\r\n2. Have different .clang-tidy configs for each style we want to try to be consistent with\r\n3. Have `*IgnoredRegexp` for any exceptions\r\n4. Document the current failures, and have a python script that catches new failures\r\n5. Maybe only run the checks over the .h files initially so we at least trend towards our exported interfaces matching our style guide... (That results in clang-tidy complaining about various things being defined but not used, but that at least seems easy enough to strip out)\r\n\r\nI think a .clang-tidy config something like:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nCheckOptions:\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.NamespaceCase,       value: lower_case }\r\n\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.NamespaceIgnoredRegexp,       value: '^(Consensus|BCLog|NetMsgType|RPCServer)$' }\r\n\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.ClassCase,           value: CamelCase }\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.StructCase,          value: CamelCase }\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.MethodCase,          value: CamelCase }\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.EnumCase,            value: CamelCase }\r\n\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.ClassIgnoredRegexp,  value: '^([a-z0-9]+_error|reverse_lock|base_blob|uint256|uint160)$' }\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.StructIgnoredRegexp,  value: '^(deserialize_type|bilingual_str|[a-z]+_iter|is_Span.*)$' }\r\n\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.MethodIgnoredRegexp,         value: '^(data|begin|end|write|read|seek|ignore|empty|size|reserve|eof|release|fclose|resize|rdbuf|in_avail|swap|[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*_)$' }\r\n\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.ClassMemberCase,     value: lower_case }\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.ConstantMemberCase,    value: lower_case }\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.PrivateMemberCase,     value: lower_case }\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.PrivateMemberPrefix,   value: m_ }\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.ProtectedMemberCase,   value: lower_case }\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.ProtectedMemberPrefix, value: m_ }\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.PublicMemberCase,      value: lower_case }\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.PublicMemberPrefix,    value: m_ }\r\n\r\n#  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.GlobalConstantCase,  value: lower_case }\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.StaticConstantCase,  value: lower_case }\r\n\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.ConstexprVariableCase,  value: UPPER_CASE }\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.ClassConstantCase,   value: UPPER_CASE }\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.EnumConstantCase,    value: UPPER_CASE }\r\n\r\n  - { key: readability-identifier-naming.ConstexprVariableIgnoredRegexp,  value: '^(deserialize|GetRandMicros|GetRandMillis)$' }\r\n```\r\n\r\nmight be a plausible start, and I came up with the following list of .h files that seem like they don't currently target our style:\r\n\r\n - script/bitcoinconsensus.h\r\n - prevector.h\r\n - indirectmap.h\r\n - fs.h\r\n - cuckoocache.h\r\n - bloom.h\r\n - bench/*\r\n - minisketch/*\r\n - crypto/*\r\n - crc32c/*\r\n - univalue/*\r\n - secp256k1/*\r\n - qt/*\r\n - wallet/*\r\n - leveldb/*\r\n - interfaces/*\r\n - ipc/*\r\n - arith_uint256.h\r\n - test/fuzz/*\r\n - tinyformat.h\r\n - reverse_iterator.h\r\n - support/allocators/*\r\n\r\nPutting that all together (and after changing a bunch of `const FOO` to `constexpr FOO`), I get about 900 remaining style errors... For what it's worth, switching `MethodCase` from `CamelCase` to `camelBack` bumps that number up to about 1900 style errors.",
