   "body" : "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. -->\r\nThe biggest problem we have at the moment is seriously the amount of changes that not only bring things to a creeping halt in certain, situations but people like me that have things that require the original 0x80 format that is a base-58 piece of encoding that is supposed to give the real keys their 5 in the beginning. Not calling it a wif key changing the outcome of the very thing needed. Not only is it near impossible to use the core for original coinbase transactions but its even more impossible to do so just on the web in these places that have been put up. One of the biggest disappointments is the so called witness script being used. I am sorry but come on an get your head out of your asses. I might have not been around very much lately but can provided the real information and show the various things that people forget about in bitcoin. Not only that I have original scripts that are near impossible to get to run again because of changes that shouldnt have been made. No court can give someone right to what they dont have, Last I checked on GitLab where the Original BitcoinD was put up along with Sirius-m laying the first commit on 08/25/2008 has all been rearranged. Thank god I didnt need anything.  I think we should come together as a community of crypto enthusiasts and understand that Sirius-m and the Real Satoshi will not stand for this. The truth is ON ITS WAY OUT!!!!!\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\nWhat should happen is for the original scripts to be allowed where they belong not cut off at Bitcoin 0.3.1 and going up. My biggest problem is that even doing it the way it should, Not only is the core not wanting to accept it but nothing online has true base 58 keys anymore. I cant do it on my own and force my way because then id be condemned a hacker or thief.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\nI rebuilt the core using the scripts from the original commit but of course like Ive said, unless its 3.1 or higher you cannot even connect or utilize the true things needed. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nI will add a copy of files needed to be added back in after Luke.Jr speaks with me or someone who continues to hold the lock on updating the Core. Mind you I can prove who I am and unlock and change things myself, However, we are supposed to be a trusted anonymous community of open source workers each to bring their good to the table through a shared online decentralized project.",
