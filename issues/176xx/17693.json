   "body" : "The existing block generation rpcs for regtest, `generatetoaddress` and `generatetodescriptor`, mine everything in the mempool up to the block weight limit. This makes it difficult to test a system for several scenarios where a different set of transactions are mined. For example:\r\n- Testing the common scenario where a transaction is replaced in the mempool but the replaced transaction is mined instead.\r\n- Testing for a double-spent transaction where a transaction that conflicts with the mempool is mined.\r\n- Testing for non-standard transactions that are mined.\r\n- Testing the scenario where several blocks are mined without a specific transaction in the mempool being included in a block.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new rpc, `generateblock`, that takes an array of raw transactions and txids and mines only those and the coinbase. Any txids must be in the mempool, but the raw txs can be anything conforming to consensus rules. The coinbase can be specified as either an address or descriptor.\r\n\r\nThis reopens #17653 since it was closed by mistake.\r\n\r\nThanks to instagibbs for code suggestions that I used here.",
