I think you could probably get better performance and fewer bugs using a small number of mutexes (maybe even just one), but just being more careful to keep the mutex locked as briefly as possible, and doing blocking operations like database writes with the mutex unlocked.\r\n\r\nThat's just an overall inclination, though. There may be different wallet functions which don't need to interact with each other and really should break off and do their own synchronization.",
