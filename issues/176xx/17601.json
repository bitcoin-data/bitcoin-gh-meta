See\r\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-February/016697.html\r\nfor full details.\r\n\r\nThe current guard against marking `CheckBlock()` failed blocks as invalid\r\nis by calling `CheckBlock()` prior to `AcceptBlock()` in `ProcessNewBlock()`.\r\nThat is brittle since `AcceptBlock()` has an implicit assumption that any\r\nblock submitted has been checked for mutation. A future change to\r\n`ProcessNewBlock()` could overlook that implicit assumption and introduce\r\na consensus failure.\r\n\r\nMove the mutation guard logic into `AcceptBlock()` and\r\nadd comments to explain why we never mark `CheckBlock()` failed blocks as\r\ninvalid.\r\n",
