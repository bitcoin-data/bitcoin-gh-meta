Someone should verify... :eyes: @EthanHeilman\r\n\r\n___Update___: Ah, so we have 512 bytes to spend, and the DNS response should look something like:\r\nHeader = 96 bits\r\nQuery = 32 bits (assuming \".\" as question)\r\nAnswer = ( 96 bits + 32 bits ) * numIPv4 + ( 96 bits + 128 bits ) * numIPv6\r\n\r\nNote that this assumes we use DNS packet compression in the Answer section, no Authority or Additional sections, and \".\" as the question (empty QNAME).\r\n\r\nSo in this case we can get 31 IPv4 addresses at the most, or 17 IPv6 addresses (with some room to spare).\r\n\r\nThis is just a rough calculation, we have yet to decide whether it is even a good reference point or not.\r\n\r\nReference: https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/fall16/compsci356/DNS/DNS-primer.pdf",

      "body" : "If I'm reading the code correctly even if you set `nMaxIPs=1` that will not stop a DNS seeder or misconfigured DNS resolver from sending you far more than `1` IP address over UDP or TCP. Instead Bitcoin will receive all of those IPs and then select `1` of them and throw away the rest. So sadly this change won't fix DNS over TCP grossness.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/73b26e38d7a174d5409dda8aa1fe9804e7779a1f/src/netbase.cpp#L194-L209\r\n\r\nIt seems reasonable to reduce this number to `64`, `32`,  or `16` but beyond that point I start to worry that there is a chance a node will get all offline IP addresses.\r\n\r\nHere is my back of the envelope calculation. Assume that U is the fraction of IP addresses returned by seeders that are offline and numSeeders is the number of DNSseeders. The probability a node gets all unreachable IP addresses is:\r\n\r\n`U^(numSeeders*nMaxIPs)`\r\n\r\n`U=0.9`, `numSeeders=8` and `nMaxIPs = 8` then the probability is 0.001. \r\n\r\n`0.00117=0.9^(8*8)`\r\n\r\nThat is we will see a failure to connect on average once each thousand times a node calls the seeders. Assuming seeders go down from time to time or incoming connection exhaustion attacks we probably want a number greater than `nMaxIPs=8`.\r\n\r\nThe blog post I wrote that counted IP addresses in a DNS query focuses on TCP based responses.\r\n[How many IP addresses can a DNS query return?](https://ethanheilman.tumblr.com/post/110920218915/how-many-ip-addresses-can-a-dns-query-return)",

Mostly because `getaddrinfo` is usually implemented in such a way that the `IPv4` addresses come before the `IPv6` addresses. As it currently stands, `IPv6` addresses are already disadvantaged by the fact that less of them fit within a 512byte payload, with this change, we'd be truncating mostly `IPv6` addresses...\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt also seems kind of weird that we're basically disadvantaging the `IPv6` network by nature of DNS's 512 byte limit (which remains true even with randomization)... I'm not sure what's best here, but perhaps a limit _per-family_ is what we want?",

      "body" : "> I like your change of pulling seed IPs by family. I think that is a good improvement and I would support merging it. I was mostly responding to the earlier comments about randomization as a solution however this solves that problem nicely.\r\n\r\nGreat! I'll push it to this PR :-)\r\n\r\n> It is satisfying that someone could write a DNS seeder that uses DNS compression to fit 16 IPv4 and 16 IPv6 addresses in one DNS packet. I think this should be recommended behavior.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, I believe this will be two DNS packets, one for `A` and another for `AAAA`, we unfortunately can't fit both 16 IPv4 and 16 IPv6 addresses in one single DNS packet.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhat's interesting here is that when I try to observe the outgoing packets using:\r\n```\r\nsudo tcpdump -ni <iface> ip src <iface-ip> and udp and port 53\r\n```\r\n\r\nand run this script:\r\n```python3\r\nimport socket\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nseeds = [ \"seed.bitcoin.sipa.be\",\r\n          \"dnsseed.bluematt.me\",\r\n          \"dnsseed.bitcoin.dashjr.org\",\r\n          \"seed.bitcoinstats.com\",\r\n          \"seed.bitcoin.jonasschnelli.ch\",\r\n          \"seed.btc.petertodd.org\",\r\n          \"seed.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl\",\r\n          \"dnsseed.emzy.de\" ]\r\n\r\nfor seed in seeds:\r\n    for family in [(socket.AF_UNSPEC, \"UNSPEC\"), (socket.AF_INET, \"INET\"), (socket.AF_INET6, \"INET6\")]:\r\n        result = len(socket.getaddrinfo(seed, None, family=family[0], type=socket.SOCK_STREAM, proto=socket.IPPROTO_TCP, flags=socket.AI_ADDRCONFIG))\r\n        print(\"Got {:>4} results for:\\t{}\\t{}\".format(result, family[1], seed))\r\n        input(\"Press Enter to continue...\")\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI see that the `UNSPEC` `getaddrinfo` sends out 4 packets, 2 for A and 2 for AAAA. I think that's twice the number of packets we expect.\r\n\r\nThe `INET` and `INET6` `getaddrinfo` only send out 1 each, which is expected.\r\n\r\nWhat's crazier is that even though the `UNSPEC` one sends out twice the expected number of packets and receives twice the expected number... Its number of results is exactly the sum of the number of results for the `INET` and `INET6` ones...\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm missing something obvious, but this seems strange.",
