   "body" : "This PR fixes the problem with handling of irregular file names described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17612\r\n\r\nIt also defines a helper function CanWriteFile that is used by dumptxoutset and dumpwallet. \r\n\r\nThis function checks for:\r\n\r\n* file name existence (if only a dir-path was given the execution stops with a corresponding JSON error)\r\n* file name validity \r\n* file name portability between POSIX and Windows\r\n* write permissions\r\n* file existence (if a file already exists the dump* operation stops, like it was done in previous versions)\r\n\r\nThe already existing JSON return objects and their messages have been preserved to prevent failing of tests and/or 3rd party tools whose parsers maybe rely on them.\r\n\r\nTwo tests have been added: in rpc_tests.cpp and test/functional/rpc_dumptxoutset.py\r\n\r\nCloses: #17612",
