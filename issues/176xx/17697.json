   "body" : "As discussed in #17594 this PR contains a GitHub Action workflow file that performs the same job as the current Appveyor CI task except for the Python functional tests. For the latter I've been unable to get them to execute successfully due to a Unicode error. I've tried on and off for a week to get it to work but with no joy. \r\n\r\nIt may be that someone more proficient in Python will recognise the error and be able to provide a pointer on how to proceed. I've tried some obvious things like changing the Windows console code page.\r\n\r\nTo run this job it should just be a matter of clicking on the GitHub `Actions` tab and enabling workflows. It's also not required that the file is on the `master` branch for the job to run. If anyone else wants to run the job they can pull this PR into their own fork and enable `Actions` (it's free).",
