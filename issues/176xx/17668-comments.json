The other one about isolating the rescan logic on the wallet-side is still relevant (b). About a \"Mempool::interface\" I think some information could be relevant in the recent discussions about [mempool-code reorganizations](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25584) (c). Wallet should have its own RPC server is already documented as a TODO in doc/multiprocess.md iirc (d). A new `Broadcast` or extended `Chain` interface would be relevant for AltNet (e).\r\n\r\nI don't have interest in doing a) or b) or d) in the coming future. I do have strong interest in c) and e) soon.\r\n\r\nFrom an issue-management standpoint, feel free to close the issue or re-dispatch the relevant informations elsewhere.",
