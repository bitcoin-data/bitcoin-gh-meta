If you've checked out and want to build 0.19.x, you should be looking at the docs in the 0.19 branch.\r\n\r\n> Before I installed OpenSSL, the build would fail with this error:\r\n> gmake[3] Leaving directory '/tmp/bitcoin/src/secp256k1\r\n> ld: error: undefined symbol: ChaCha20::Keystream(unsigned char*, unsigned long)\r\n> >>> referenced by random.h.118(./random.h:118)\r\n\r\nI've just built master (5622d8f3156a293e61d0964c33d4b21d8c9fd5e0) and `v0.19.0.1` on OpenBSD 6.6 the `OpenSSL` didn't need to be installed for either (`pkg_info` below). `bitcoind` is linked against `libsodium.so`.\r\n\r\nIf you are still having issues compiling after cleaning your build directory, and rebuilding, please open an issue with all the relevant information.
