   "body" : "There has been light conceptual agreement on including the USDT based tracepoints in Bitcoin Core release builds. This, for example, enables user to hook into production deployments, if they need to. Binaries don't have to be switched out. This is possible because we don't do [expensive computations](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tracing.md#no-expensive-computations-for-tracepoints) only for the tracepoints and the tracepoints are NOPs when not used.\r\n\r\nThere is a slight chance that the GUIX build on the current master already includes the tracepoints. I have not done an GUIX build on a branch with the tracepoints merged yet. This can be tested on a `bitcoind` binary using one of the methods mentioned in the [tracing documentation section \"Listing avaliable tracepoints\"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tracing.md#listing-available-tracepoints).\r\n\r\nIf not present, making the `systemtap` headers (`sys/sdt.h`) available during the GUIX build should build `bitcoind` with the tracepoints.\r\n",
