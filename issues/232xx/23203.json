   "body" : "This proof of concept is one approach to static [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/) based builds. It leverages [musl-cross-make](https://github.com/richfelker/musl-cross-make) to compile a musl libc targeting toolchain, made up of GCC 10.3.0 + binutils 2.37 + musl libc 1.2.3, and then uses that toolchain to build our depends libraries, and ultimately `bitcoind`.\r\n\r\nMore than likely we'd take a different approach in Guix for (potentially) release builds, however, something like this could exist in depends, and provide an alternative to building against glibc outside Guix. Or, this may well end up being something we just throw away in favour of a better approach; still lots to be thought about here.\r\n\r\nOnly tested compiling on, for `x86_64-pc-linux-gnu` so far.\r\n\r\nYou can use it as follows:\r\n```bash\r\nmake -C depends/ -j9 NO_QT=1 NO_WALLET=1 NO_UPNP=1 NO_ZMQ=1 NO_NATPMP=1 USE_MUSL_LIBC=1 HOST=x86_64-linux-musl\r\n./autogen.sh\r\nCONFIG_SITE=/path/to/your/bitcoin/depends/x86_64-pc-linux-musl/share/config.site ./configure --enable-reduce-exports --enable-lto LDFLAGS=\"-Wl,-O2\" LIBTOOL_APP_LDFLAGS=\"-all-static\"\r\nmake src/bitcoind\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe end result (once stripped) is a ~10mb static `bitcoind`:\r\n```bash\r\nldd src/bitcoind\r\n\tstatically linked\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you see:\r\n```bash\r\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'\r\n  what():  locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid\r\nAborted (core dumped)\r\n```\r\nwhen running, pass `LC_ALL=C`. i.e `LC_ALL=C src/bitcoind`. \r\n\r\nI've taken the binary onto a few different system / inside VMs, and am running a full sync.\r\n\r\nNote that all dependencies do compile, except for Qt (build issue with FreeType I have not investigated), I've just excluded all optional dependencies from the depends build above.\r\n\r\nWhen building, you may see warnings about libraries, such as `libstdc++`, as having been moved, during linking, and/or other warnings, from dependencies, such as sqlite, due to `-flto` usage.\r\n\r\nRelated to #18110.",
