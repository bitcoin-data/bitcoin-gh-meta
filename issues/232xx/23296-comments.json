      "body" : "I've focused on getting a proof-of-concept (PoC) running on CirrussCI for now. I solved a few of the bigger issues, but I'm at a point where I think the CI containers don't have enough permissions to attach to the USDT tracepoints. I've learned a bit about the CI and want to document my process here for future re-attempts.\r\n\r\nMy PoC branch is https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoin/commits/2022-01-tracepoint-ci-poc\r\n\r\n**tl;dr:** I think we are not able to set the required Linux capabilities to test USDT tracepoints on CirrusCi: `Unable to set capabilities [--caps=CAP_SYS_ADMIN+ep]`.\r\n\r\nfirst commit: My approach for the PoC was to drop all tasks besides the `[lint]` task for less CI load. No need to re-test the same Bitcoin Core code over and over. I've then added a CI task specifically for the USDT tracing tests, disabling e.g. the unit tests and existing functional tests for faster CI feedback. I checked that the newly added CI task builds the (or uses the cached) depends including the systemtap depends added in #23724 and that `use usdt` is `true` the configure stage.\r\n\r\nsecond commit: The next step was to set the prerequisites for the USDT functional tests up. This test should only be run when a) the tracepoints are compiled and b) the Python `bcc` ([iovisor/bcc](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc)) is installed. I've added the relevant checks to `test_framework.py` and a  `ENABLE_USDT_TRACEPOINTS` flag in the `config.ini.in`. Additionally, I've added `bpfcc-tools` to the installed packages for the `bcc` Python package.\r\n\r\nthird commit: Then, I've added an `interface_usdt.py` PoC functional test based on the [`log_raw_p2p_msgs.py`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/tracing/log_raw_p2p_msgs.py) example. It checks that at least one inbound and one outbound P2P message is received over the USDT interface.\r\n\r\nfourth commit: The BPF bytecode compilation from the provided C code failed. The kernel headers are missing. It took me a while to remember that containers use the host's kernel. This means the relevant kernel headers can't be found/installed in the Ubuntu jammy container. According to the [Cirrus CI documentation](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/linux/), the `container` instances run on a GKE cluster of compute-optimized instances running in Google Cloud. These run Google's [Container-Optimized OS](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/concepts/features-and-benefits) COS with their own kernel. Specifically, (I think) the [`cos-89-16108-534-8`](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes/m89#cos-89-16108-534-8) release with the `COS-5.4.144` Linux kernel. It's possible to retrieve the kernel source and run the `make oldconfig` and `make prepare` steps using the kernel configuration in `/proc/config.gz`. This is, for example, done in `iovisor/kubectl-trace` (Kubernetes tracing) for COS too. See [`fetch-linux-headers.sh`](iovisor/kubectl-trace/blob/master/build/init/fetch-linux-headers.sh). Fetching the kernel headers and the `make` steps take a few minutes. However I think this could be cached and only needs to be done one time when Cirrus CI upgrades their host OS to a newer version. We need to set the `BCC_KERNEL_SOURCE` env var to the generated kernel headers. The BPF bytecode compilation succeeds now. \r\n\r\nfifth commit: We lack the required permissions to open the BPF maps. I assumed this could be solved by adding the required capabilities (to docker). It wasn't clear to me that `DOCKER_EXEC` does, in fact, not run `docker exec <args>`. The CI is run in the CirrusCI container itself at the moment. See `DANGER_RUN_CI_ON_HOST`. (Maybe just `EXEC` would be a better name). So adding `--cap-add=CAP_X` to `DOCKER_ADMIN` (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23296#issuecomment-997217488) did not work. I've opted to use `capsh` to set the required capabilities. With the host's 5.4 Linux kernel, we can't use `CAP_BPF` and `CAP_PERFMON` as they were introduced in 5.8. We have to fall back to `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`. However, this fails with `Unable to set capabilities [--caps=CAP_SYS_ADMIN+ep]`. Later, I discovered https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-ci-docs/issues/654, where MarcoFalke already asked about this for `wine`.\r\n\r\nHere's the failed CI task: https://cirrus-ci.com/task/6305351615119360\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMaybe @MarcoFalke has further ideas? Or @laanwj? I think having automatically run tests for the tracepoints is important. I don't think running these on a different CI is a good solution though.\r\n\r\nI'll be focusing on a PoC for local development machines for now. It should be possible to run these with `sudo capsh ...`, dropping privilege while only keeping the required capabilities. While these functional tests would be skipped on most development machines, they could at least be run to e.g. test release candidates and on PRs adding new tracepoints (with tests).\r\n\r\n",
