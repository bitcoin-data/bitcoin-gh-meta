      "body" : "@laanwj Yes, but in this case we're actually opting out of some of those protections because of the semantics of Span. By default, the returned iterator type for a potentially dangling reference is a `std::ranges::dangling`. By opting in to `enable_borrowed_range`, we get a real return type. Otherwise it'd fail to compile the `*iter` dereference in the `printf`. This is also used by `std::string_view`, for example.\r\n\r\nThe `enable_view` seems to be another way of saying pretty much the same thing but for a different semantic reason.\r\n\r\nI found it useful to copy/paste a little cheat-sheet of these concepts from libstdc++'s implementation:\r\n```c++\r\n/// [range.range] The range concept.\r\ntemplate<typename _Tp>\r\n  concept range = requires(_Tp& __t)\r\n    {\r\n  ranges::begin(__t);\r\n  ranges::end(__t);\r\n    };\r\n\r\ntemplate<typename _Tp>\r\n  concept view\r\n    = range<_Tp> && movable<_Tp> && default_initializable<_Tp>\r\n  && enable_view<_Tp>;\r\n\r\n// Part of the constraints of ranges::borrowed_range\r\ntemplate<typename _Tp>\r\n  concept __maybe_borrowed_range\r\n  = is_lvalue_reference_v<_Tp>\r\n    || enable_borrowed_range<remove_cvref_t<_Tp>>;\r\n\r\ntemplate<typename _Tp>\r\n  concept borrowed_range\r\n    = range<_Tp> && __detail::__maybe_borrowed_range<_Tp>;\r\n\r\n/// A range which can be safely converted to a view.\r\ntemplate<typename _Tp>\r\n  concept viewable_range = range<_Tp>\r\n    && (borrowed_range<_Tp> || view<remove_cvref_t<_Tp>>);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example, enabling `enable_borrowed_range` alone is enough to make both examples compile, because (I believe) the first only requires a `viewable_range`.\r\n\r\n~Interestingly, libstdc++'s definitions line up with the [c++20 final draft spec](https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4861/range.refinements), but [differ from cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges/viewable_range). I'm assuming that the latter is stale, so it's probably worth using the draft spec for reference for now.~\r\nI actually had this backwards. cppreference incorporates [LWG 3481](https://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/lwg-defects.html#3481), which libstdc++ [includes as of last week](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/commit/a2c2dcc6ca205a8c5c76b04ef2eb4fb097dcb069) and [P2415R2](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P2415R2.html), which has not yet been integrated.",
