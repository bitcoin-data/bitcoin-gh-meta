Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI want to sync main and test and sig nets sequentially, but if I hit Ctrl-c, it would abort not the daemon run, but the whole script, at some builds. Not when using any shell, or not every build. Some builds and shells seem to work the way I want to syncing all chains.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI think one lazy but valid way to solve my problem is to have a shutdown CLI command.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nTry to dive deeper in why the script is aborting early at some builds or shells...\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n(Nothing yet)\r\n",
